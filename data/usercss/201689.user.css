@description    `Hides the comments on Crunchyroll and VRV shows. Avoid the temptation to look and inevitably stress out!Let's face it: unless you are, in fact, a troll, reading comments is basically always stressful. This removes the comment sections on videos on both Crunchyroll and VRV, as well as the series comments and "reviews" on Crunchyroll series pages. Feel the serenity flow through you. You're welcome.`
