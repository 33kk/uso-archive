    "name": "Furaffinity Sidebar Space Remover",
    "description": "This is a code meant to be used in conjoint with <a href=http://boothale.net/scripts/facleanup.html>this code</a>, it removes the space above the FurAffinity sidebar that is left for ads to be placed there. Sadly though AdBlockPlus may remove the ad it sometimes has trouble removing the space left behind. I had made the attempt to try and remove the space through AdBlock but was not successful. I have only ever tested this on Google Chrome, I'm not sure what effect it will have on other browsers.",
    "additionalInfo": "The code indeed works when AdBlockPlus is not in use, at least on Google Chrome. I am still not certain of how well it will work on other browsers.",
