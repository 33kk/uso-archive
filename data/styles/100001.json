    "name": "Heritage Bank Australia set mobile site max width",
    "description": "The desktop site for Heritage Bank (Australia) uses an on-screen keyboard, which is impossible to fill with password managers. The mobile version allows regular input and therefore gives quicker access to the basic list of transactions, but obviously it's styled for much narrower browser widths than a widescreen monitor. This style simply sets a maximum width to the content, and also centers the content.",
    "additionalInfo": "The maximum width is set to 767 pixels, which is what Twitter BootStrap defines as 'tablet' by default. (Ref: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/a444863268/less/variables.less#L272 )",
