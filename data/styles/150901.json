    "description": "This script will make the pop-up container for the rapid recommendations posts transparent. This appears when you like a post on your Tumblr dashboard.\r\n\r\nWorks well for people using tumblr styles that change the background colour of your dash :)",
    "additionalInfo": "This script also makes the title for the container ('You might like these too:\" or some variation) more opaque so you can see it easier against your background. However, you can edit the colour if you like. It also gives each icon a little drop shadow, but again, you can remove that from the code if you like.",
