    "description": "A Cedar theme that uses the font on the Wii U. If it doesn't work the first time, you probably don't have the font installed, so here ya go: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13lpGGtOd8-8uXFS-36S2dFuWLHw7IDbR/view?usp=sharing",
    "additionalInfo": "3/31/18 - I sort of just copy and pasted the code from the Closedverse version of this I made, so this may or may not work.\r\nA few minutes later - Never mind. Like what happened with the Closedverse theme, it worked.\r\n8/6/18 - Now comments work with this theme. Hurray! That took me longer to figure out than it should have.",
