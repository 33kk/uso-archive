Resolution required: 1320x800 or more.\r\n\r\nNormally, when you scroll through comments, the video gets scrolled up off the screen. This has been intentionally bad design on Youtube's part for years, because they want you to click through related videos that might have ads, instead of engaging in the comments section.\r\n\r\nThis userstyle fixes that: you can now watch the video and read/reply to the text comments at the same time.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Dan Dascalescu\r\nhttp://dandascalescu.com",
