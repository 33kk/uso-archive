    "additionalInfo": "2021-04-17: \r\nUpdated colors to make it less harsh on the eyes. Background is now slightly lighter than pure black, and text is now slightly darker than pure white.\r\nNow makes use of style settings feature that didn't exist way back when. You no longer need to uncomment code.\r\n\r\n2006-09-11:\r\nMade optional section apply more specifically to the elements it should be applying to. I hadn't really been trying to fix that until now, because... I don't exactly use that part myself.\r\nAlso forced to only apply to web pages and not browser chrome, considering it doesn't work anywhere near correctly on browser chrome anyway, and there are other better ways to mess with that.",
