{"id":184479,"info":{"name":"See the simul host's point of view","description":"Tired of scrolling around to see which game the simul host is looking at? The current game is placed right atop the other games. Also semi-responsive (adapts to the size of the screen, sort of)! The only side effect I've noticed is that completed simuls have a large blank space where the current game board is supposed to go. I'm not sure if I can fix that.","format":"uso","category":"lichess","updatedAt":"2020-05-31T00:16:45.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":330753,"name":"Seanysean2"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":2,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"184479_after.png","isMainArchived":true},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://lichess.org/simul/\") {\r\n    .game-list {\r\n        margin-top: 450px !important;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n    .host {\r\n        padding: 0 !important;\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        top: -400px;\r\n        left: 50%;\r\n        transform: translateX(-50%);\r\n        width: 304px; /* multiple of 8 */\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        box-shadow: 0 0 0 7px rgba(214,79,0,0.5) !important;\r\n    }\r\n}"}}
