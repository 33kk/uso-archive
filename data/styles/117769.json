    "description": "Scratch recently redesigned their website to add an \"About\" section, and make the search bar teeny tiny. This reverts that change, for people who don't like it, and also vertically centers the search bar a little bit better.",
    "additionalInfo": "Really all it does is hide the 4th item in the navbar, which is \"About\" at the time of publish. If the bar is ever reordered, it's not smart enough to find the one that says \"About\", so it will hide something else random instead. Uh oh. Ping me on Scratch and I'll fix it - I'm @scratchisthebest\r\n\r\nEdit: Adjusted to react better to Scratch's new search bar changes. Still hides the About menu.",
