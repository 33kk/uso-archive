    "name": "CustomizeGoogle - remove filtered",
    "description": "When the \"filter\" option is used in CustomizeGoogle (a wonderful extension, by the way), the filtered results are replaced with a line of text alerting you that a result has been removed.\r\n\r\nOriginally inspired by style 303, the purpose of this style is to ENTIRELY remove ALL filtered search results; if I intended to filter a specific site, I don't necessarily want to a giant hole in the layout of search results.  This style takes care of that, removing any trace, all without breaking the layout of the page.  Also, you do not have to update your \"list\", as there is no \"list,\" as there is in style 303.\r\n\r\nThis style works for both sites CustomizeGoogle filters: 1) Google search results and 2) Google News\r\n\r\nIf you use CustomizeGoogle, please also see: style 2539, style 2540, style 2541, and style 2542.\r\n\r\n(03-08-08 - updated to include the inexplicable addition of the \"http://www.l.google.com\" domain)\r\n(09-02-08 - updated to reflect new Google code)\r\n(09-15-08 - code cleanup & updated to again reflect new Google code)",
