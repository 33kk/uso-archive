    "additionalInfo": "I found this code in the adblock plus forum.  It compactifies the addon bar icons. This will disable some functionality on the items you put down there, so just re-enable them by adding their specific instance and defining the drop marker to be true.  I'll eventually comment in some code to make this easier.  I am using the Barlesque addon in the screen shots.  It is a good companion to this style but not required. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/barlesque/\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: This can potentially reduce the functionality of some of these buttons.  I am looking for a collection of buttons that can be commented in and out at the users will.  Just be aware that this can make some functions inaccessible via the add-on bar.",
