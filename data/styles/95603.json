    "description": "Because AO3's stats coding could be more user friendly, with some basic link colour fudging this style \"hides\" anything that is a hyperlink on the stats line of a work on the AO3 tags page (comments, kudos, bookmarks, and unfortunately also collection). In addition, this style also hides the stats line completely on the work's page as well as the block of uses who have given kudos at the bottom of a work, as well as hides the numbers on any user's works page.",
    "additionalInfo": "03/12/2013 Updated for https://\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n01/12/2013 Updated to hide stats on chapters.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n30/11/2013 NOTE: This only works if your background is white. If your background is any other colour, you will need to edit the style so the text colour matches the background.\r\n\r\nAlso note: This does not hide the number of comments in the \"show comments\" button at the bottom of the page because I didn't think of it until now. If I can figure it out, this may be added. I'm not very good at this, okay? It also doesn't hide hits, because a) that is in the functionality of AO3 already, and b) even though that functionality is broken for half of us, it was beyond me today getting THAT to work too.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to still show the block of users who have given kudos at the bottom of a work, edit the style and remove line 2 in the second code box (the .kudos line).",
