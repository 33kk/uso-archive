    "additionalInfo": "They had to remove the word \"youtube\" from their logo as Youtube-mp3.org was successfully sued and shut down. I found this as a proper alternative and the only thing i could remember it with was that their logo contained a shark with an MP3 player. Then they removed it. I brought it back so I can remember what site it is.",
