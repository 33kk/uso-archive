    "description": "This forces the header_beta element to stay fixed on the screen, and adjusts the video element to sit underneath that.",
    "additionalInfo": "Ever scroll down to through the comments on crunchyroll, and then want to just hit your queue from wherever you are in the page?  I sure did and found that it was pretty trivial to create a userstyle to do just that.  This is my first attempt at a userstyle, so there may be more elegance that could be added.  If you have any suggestions, please let me know.\r\n\r\nI am using it on Firefox running under Linux and have not done any testing in any other browser.\r\n\r\n*Update 11/11/2013*\r\nChanged the content following Cookie338's recommendation.  This version uses the outer template_container div.  Originally I was happy that the episode title was covered up by the header, but my intent was really just to make the header stick, not change what is displayed on the page, and this fixes that.  Thanks Cookie338!\r\n\r\n*Update 10/30/2013*\r\nDiscovered the rest of the pages use a different container, so the top of the main page, and browsing series pages was getting stuck under the fixed header.  I've added a margin to correct for that.",
