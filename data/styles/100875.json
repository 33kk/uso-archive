    "name": "Tumblr Login/Not Found Background Disable",
    "description": "***IMPORTANT UPDATE!! CHECK THE NOTES SECTION BELOW!!***\r\n\r\nShort script designed to eliminate the background images from tumblr logins. For some unknown reason Tumblr staff sees fit to allow flashy .gifs and incredibly bright images to display in fullscreen behind the tumblr login information, which not only makes it hard to see but can cause epileptic shock for people with photosensitivity. This script disables that background image completely and just leaves the nice blue color we all know.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nUpdated this morning to include disabling the background for 404 pages! If you've already installed, just click the green \"Install with stylish\" button below and it should update automagically.",
    "additionalInfo": "Update Nov. 11, 2014\r\nTumblr staff has once again changed the login background. It now uses one of those weird slide panel things that shows you how the site works. I've updated the script again and disabled the background colors since they chose bright freakin green and orange. There's a bar on the left to show where you're at in the slides that I left in, and the login screen only appears on the first one and the last one. Sorry for the inconvenience!",
