    "additionalInfo": "<b>Information</b>\r\nThis website has a lot of web games. Because some people (read: EVERYBODY) might not like the bright red background, I created this style to address this small corner of the web so people can have more fun playing what they want from this website.\r\n\r\nThe changes this style provides are in the spirit of the author's intended look, so it's still a red background, albeit a dark red one.\r\n\r\n<b>Updates</b>\r\n<i>12/19/15</i> When proginally published, I forgot to limit the reach of the style so it made all of background red and all of font white, no matter where you went. Resolved.",
