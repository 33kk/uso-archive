### Description
Changes the style of image-boards in 4chan.org to a darker theme. Well it helps my eyes to relax anyway. Doesnt work on discussion boards.
I just made this, so id expect to run into some stuff that need to be changed, but overally I think it looks decent.
(Re)learning some stuff, so might even make a complete remake of this some day.

Making a new one now due to all the changes in 4chan. (26.6.08)

Changes:
4th Jan 07: Fixed OP's name showing in black when using email address.
3th Dec: Made /f/-board look a little better. 
22th Nov: Replytitle-color changed and some minor stuff.
21th Nov: Changed filetitle from blue to gray.
