### Description
Since it makes a year since hte maker did the last modif, i decided to post my version of Beautiful Digg, which is a dark(almost black) skin for Digg.
It might not be as great as the original, but sine digg changes templates quite often, better that than nothing.

I'm not a big user of digg, i mainly use the front page and the comments. So if you have suggestions about things to change, keep me posted!

As for the header, the rollover and other suck things are just making it be 60% of try randomly until its ok, which i dont feel like. There is color, its not white, so its not that bad anyways..
