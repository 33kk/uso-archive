### Description
Well after fidgeting around and needing to access my menu bar quickly in Minefield, I grew tired of using the ALT key to bring the menu up so I created this for easier use.

Just hover over the navbar and it'll come out in a nicely animated sequence; vice versa. It doesn't get any lazier than this :p

Note: If there are any issues with the menu bar just hit ALT and it shall revert,
also this goes perfect with the default minefield style or the aero one by drifus.

Remember kids, you found it here first ;) !
