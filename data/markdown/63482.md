### Description
A dark theme for YouTube that was originally based on the "Earth Hour 2012" look.
- Firefox & Chrome tested -
Style started by YouTube but continued, improved, and extended throughout the site by me.

This style has been updated for YouTube's New Look that happened December 2012.
After some long sessions and a complete re-write, I am ready to release what I have.
If there are any issues, PLEASE make a NEW post in the discussion section and I will get to it when I can!

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
I am going to PAX East coming up, so most of my free time has been spent planning. But once I return and am settled, I'll be working on this theme again. Sorry for the wait and thanks for your patience.
