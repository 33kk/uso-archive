### Description
It's a style I made for those of you who have Windows 10, it fits the dark color pallet of Windows 10 pretty nicely.
The unusual parts: the parts I was testing a lot with were the userlist and the battle layout.
All of that mixed up with a pretty awesome background ;D
If you want to talk to me about any bugs or problem with the css contact me on <a href="http://origin.psim.us/">origin</a>, I'm usually under the name Master Float.
