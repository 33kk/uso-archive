### Description
A style for AniList which has options to change many aspects of the site.

Current options:
Navbar from the side to the top and made smaller.
Widened many aspects of the site to better utilise screen space.
Semi-transparent like/reply counters in order to see partially hidden statuses.

### Update notes
Thanks to Kuwabara for advice and providing the base for the navbar move and Kazakuri for advice!
Also fully compatible with this awesome style https://userstyles.org/styles/119215 (don't move the navbar using that style if using this ones)
