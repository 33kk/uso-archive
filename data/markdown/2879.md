### Description
This style shows more feeds in Flat view without scrolling on Fastladder.

Note:
If feeds have long title, you cannot see unread count.

This style based on http://blog.livedoor.jp/hakin/archives/50833924.html for livedoor Reader.


/*
I think Fastladder is the fastest web-based RSS reader.
And some tips make it faster for people reading hundreds of feeds.
- Use keyboard shortcuts.
-- For example, S key shows next feed and prefetches next 2 feeds in the background.
- Change some settings.
-- Show only updated feeds: enabled.
-- Number of 'My Feeds' to show: Set limit to 10-20 feeds. (based on your window size)
-- My Feeds view: Flat and Rating.
