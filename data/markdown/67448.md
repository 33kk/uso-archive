### Description
****11/14/2012 - THE LATEST UPDATE LOOKS BEST WITH THE HIGH CONTRAST THEME (GO TO SETTINGS > THEMES AND SELECT THE "High Contrast" THEME). IF THERE IS ENOUGH DEMAND TO KEEP THE DEFAULT LIGHTER THEME I WILL UPDATE THIS TO MAKE IT WORK WITH THE DEFAULT LIGHTER THEME AS WELL.

This is a CSS3 theme for Gmail, designed to be ultra clean and minimal (Cleanimal). I created this theme to find things easily and be more productive in Gmail. This creates an optimum amount of screen space and allows you to work more efficiently with your labels in the sidebar.

I have optimized this for modern browsers and tested in latest versions of Firefox and Chrome. Read "Additional Info" for full details of this theme.
