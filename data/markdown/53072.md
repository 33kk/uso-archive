### Description
Make the Firefox App Button look like a Tab in maximized window only on the default theme, with Windows Aero enabled.
Restore and Maximize the window to load the style properly.

This style breaks Fitt's Law for the first top-left pixel of the screen. If you think this is a major drowback, please spend a minute to let me know in the comments or use this style >http://userstyles.org/styles/44082<
