### Description
★★★ Update for Feedly Dark Mode ★★★

Feedly finally added a native Dark Mode. That allow me to remove an lot of code not anymore necessary.

Like the title suggests, this is a simple dark (or night) style that uses an almost black color for the background and white/green for RSS content and other text elements.

I tried also to reduced the unused space and to make fit better on Full HD and 4K screens.

I'll tune this style to target my personal tastes, but I would try to implement any good suggestion you want to provide me.

★★★ Tested both on Firefox and Chrome extension ★★★

If you like the style, you can offer me <b>a coffee ☕ or a beer 🍺</b> using the Pledge button below! Thank you!
