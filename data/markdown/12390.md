### Description
EDIT: Google jacked everything around since I wrote this, so it doesn't work anymore. I'll leave it up just in case anyone wants to take some elements from this and run with it. Don't worry about giving me credit - All I want is money, fuck the fame - I'm a simple man.


My version of style 9867 by user 2843, with a more traditional Google look (no tweaks to the search bar/logo/results bar/header & un-"compact"-ed).

I also removed those annoying SearchWiki links from the results.
