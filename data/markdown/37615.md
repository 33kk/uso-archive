### Description
I didn't really like the huge size of the dashboard in the new twitter layout, so I made it smaller (230px) while keeping everything in one collumn, and extending the main content to 780px.

Had to make the footer text really small (8px) to fit the dashboard. Looking for a better fix for twitter's "fake" unordered lists.
