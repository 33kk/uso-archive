### Description
curabitr is a stylish userstyle for 4chan that breaks from the 'dark like my souls' styles of yesteryear.

A fairly inactive place to comment and look for changes with the CSS is on it's github page here: https://github.com/saxamaphone69/curabitr

Regarding the new HTML/CSS, this style is pretty unused. I sorta updated it, but it does not look as good as it did in the glory days. I won't delete it though, for the good of the internet.
