### Description
Force 16:9 aspect ratio in Ultrawide or Short(like 4:3) video.
It just works in only YouTube.
It is my first CSS, so it may have some wasteful styles.
It may give you a broken layout in preview tooltip. I think it can be fixed,but I couldn't solve it. I gave some temporary measures to this CSS, but it is not cool :(
If you can fix this problem,please mention to @Misoni64T on Twitter. I can understand easy English and Japanese.
