### Description
Between 2004 an part of 2007 the Winamp forums sported a pair of guys with speakers for heads! (Crazy I know!)

Anyway, after that the visual flair of the forums nose dived.
That was until people started making custom themes, with stylish.

Soooo...
Want a taste of the old school? Try this then!

Still WIP - I guess

I cannot copy the original theme perfectly due to layout changes, so this is a compromise aimed at achieving the best I can do while keeping my sanity.
