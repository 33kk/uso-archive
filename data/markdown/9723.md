** Extreme thanks to user 1200 for style 8634, upon which this is based, supported, and an addon for!

The Add to Bookmarks Popup appears when you click the Bookmark Star on the Awesome Bar, just to the right of the Awesome Bar.  This dialog also appears if you press the key combination Ctrl+D (Command+D on mac)

Features:
