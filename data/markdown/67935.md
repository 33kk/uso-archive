### Description
Simplistic light gray redesign of the Wikipedia site.

This removes much of the editing links and options as well as the sign on stuff. Basically it's for people who just view articles.

I'll try to keep this updated and probably make some different themes in the future. I'm open to suggestions and let me know what you think.

*** Updated 062710 - Removed white bar across the top caused by a recent update to mediawiki's tag id naming scheme.
*** Updated 121310 - Updated for international support. Should now work for all languages. 
*** Updated 062212 - This version has been deprecated. When it no longer looks right depending on your version of Firefox, please use the version at http://userstyles.org/styles/30140/wikipedia-gray-simplistic   The newer version works well with Firefox 16 Alpha build and up. I will monitor and keep that version updated.
