### Description
A dark fantasy or gaming like style for facebook and all Chrome Browsers. The name of this styl comes from a german multi gaming and modding community "Die-Wacht-Gaming.de" and is used by our users. This style is based on the "Facebook - Dark Shiny Blue, transparency" from "DaedalusIcarusHelios" he has done a fantastic work and I want to say Thank You. I`ve done just some small color changes and have integrated a new background image, so all the praise goes to DaedalusIcarusHelios.
