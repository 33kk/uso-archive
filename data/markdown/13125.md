<strong>Installation Notes!</strong>

<ul>
<li>For proper compatibility make sure that you are using the default gray theme, not dark.</li>
<li>Enter your username below to highlight your quotes in people's posts.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<em>Alternatively, edit the style and enter it manually. Look for <strong><code>data-username=</code></strong> and enter your user name.</em></p>
<p>Eg, if your username is "example" make sure that it looks like the following:<br>
<strong><code>blockquote.quote[data-username="example"]</code></strong>.<br><br> You must do this <strong>twice</strong>.</em>

### Update notes
*** N O T I C E ***

This style has not and does not remove ads.

Although there have been two other themes added to userstyles based on this one, I would like it no one tweak this theme and redistributes it. You can modify this theme for your own needs, for your own use, but do not share it without asking first.
