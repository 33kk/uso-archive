### Description
This stylesheet now really does three things: removes ad space, removes 'clutter' (i.e. too many, not-really-necessary elements in too little space), and employs some _minor_ style twists for a more pleasing look. 

The various parts of the stylesheet are clearly labeled. If you don't like some part, simply delete the appropriate section. Note: Some subsections of the site ('world', 'debate', 'members', ?) still use an old  stylesheet - I haven't tried to style those. The articles under those headings conform to the new stylesheet (and thus to this mod).

This stylesheet blocks the site's self-promoting popups. 'Blocks' here means doesn't show. Consider using Greasemonkey to modify the popup scripts or Stylish-creator Jason Barnabe's YesScript to block the site from using javascript altogether.

Tip: The 5/week article limit imposed on non-registered non-subscribers is cookie-based, not ip-based. Flush/block their cookies and continue reading.
