### Description
Removes all of the junk from C-net news and expands the reading area to fill more space.  Also gets rid of ads and provides a standard background (no event-centered backgrounds).  Works on all CNet news articles as well as the articles list, has nothing to do with Japan, unlike most (all?) of the other CNet styles I have seen.
