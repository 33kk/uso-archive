### Description
My first, quick attempt at maximizing my screen size for TheWest.net.
My monitor is 1440 x 900.

...again, this is a first attempt...and I'm only just starting...

So far, the only modification is a larger map and inventory window.

Update 1: Fullscreen map (a little sluggish for me, but I couldn't help myself)
Update 2: Check out the new Work window location (hint: look down)
Update 3: Applied to game worlds only (fixed forum blackout)
