### Description
Results in columns, compact interface, no ads and clean theme. It works in all locations of Google Web Search.

Something does not work properly? Got a question? PLEASE email me (battleprogrammertidus at gmail dot com) so we can discuss it. THANKS.

Customize:

- You can easily change width of search box by changing the values of the "width" property of the following line:
input[type=text], td.nobr.xsm { width: 280px !important; } 

- By default, automatically creates two columns, but if you want you can set the number of columns that you want. You just have to change the value (2) of the following line in your code:
-moz-column-count: 2 !important;

- You can change anything you like. The code is fully documented and clean. Watch the code and look what you want to change, the comments identify that part of the code corresponds each group of properties.

Take a look at my other themes for Google Web Search:
- style 9867

And my compact and clean style for Google Image Search:
- style 9941

Inspired by the following style:
- style 728 by user 558

FAQ:
- "Advanced Search" and "preferences" are inside the search box, with a small size. By passing the mouse over shall be made larger.
- Mozilla Add-on GooglePreview has compatibility with zero-configuration.
- Google Reader has compatibility with zero-configuration.

PS: This style is recommended for panoramic screens or with great resolution (the recommended minimum width is 1024px). The screenshot is made in a MacBook, with 13" screen and a resolution of 1280x800. The recommended use is for Firefox 3.5 or above. You can try to use with any other modern browser but, you have to adapt the specials -moz properties, like -moz-border-radius, -moz-box-shadow, moz-column-count, etc.

Changes:

April 9, 2009: Compatibility with WOT Add-on

June 25, 2009: Bug fixes and more compatibility, support for new feature "Show options...", new css effects (you need at least Firefox 3.5 to see it), "Searches related to: " at the bottom's page now is collapsed by default, and auto-expands when mouse is hover.

July 2, 2009: Fixed the problem reported by heartrobber18. I have not managed to reproduce the error in my browser, but I added the code implemented by heartrobber18 for its own style. I hope this solves the problem without having to rely on another style. Code adapted to the new html (changed by Google). Fixed (again?) Google logo view on the home page.

July 9, 2009: Correcting the position of the bar with the total number of results.

July 15, 2009: Fixed a bug that affected the position of "Display Options ..." after selecting an option outside of the default.

August 8, 2009: Fixed changes by Google.
