### Description
Removes the Throbber Button icon from the Main (Navigation) Toolbar.   The throbber is the small circular clickable area on the top-right corner of your browser that animates when a page is loading. Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.  Works for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.

** Idea came from user 1's style 469.  Thanks Jason!

Integrates with Style 7174, and Style 7169, allowing you to remove the RSS Icon, the Bookmark favorite icon, and the Go Button.

Changelog:
- Initial Release
