### Description
An attempt to cure Salon of its new blinding black-and-red color scheme; the only other thing I altered was to delete the gigantic pointless "SALON" that was at the top.  I'm documenting with comments as I go along so people can change the colors around to suit their own preferences (and hopefully post their versions for others to try out).
