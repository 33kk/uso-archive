### Description
Increases the game window size (to whatever you want), and removes most of the extra junk (ad panels, bars, notices, etc).
So you can actually have some space to play! 

Made specifically for Zynga's "ville" series of game.

By default the game window will be 1000px high.
To change this, you can edit the section marked "increase game window" at the top of the style script.
