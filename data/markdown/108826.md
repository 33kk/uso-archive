### Description
This allows you to use one of the pre-chosen images or set any image from the internet / your computer to be the background image on Imgur.

### Update notes
Apparently works with gifs too, but you'll want to find a high resolution image to take up the whole screen. Also remember that it needs to load the image so the larger the file, the more likely you are to notice it load. There are also some settings you can change regarding the position of the image, the background for viewing just the image (not in the gallery) and also an option to get rid of the share buttons.

Special thanks to Drydareelin, who's "Imgur Space Theme" css greatly helped me get this working properly. Check out their stuff and maybe give them some installs. :)

*update 5/6/15* Made it much easier to get the background you want when installing instead of making you go through the code to change it. Also added some options for positioning the image and removing share options which, let's be honest, you probably don't use anyways, but you can always leave it if you want.

*update 5/29/15* Fixed scaling - should allow images to fit the screen even if they aren't the proper resolution. Let me know if things are still messed up.

*update 11/17/15* Added the feature from http://imgur.com/user/lahwran to change usernames with "PhotoofMichaelCera" to red, as shown here http://imgur.com/gallery/jDnwf . In the future I'll remove if from being defaulted to being an option but you can always go into the script and remove it yourself.
