If you want stylish Headlines download the "Zrnic Font" from Larabie - it's a 100% legal Freeware Font.

Images and Table in JTAS Articles have sometimes different widths. This leads to broken Layouts with "Zrnic Red - 2 Columns". I don't know if i could fix this issue, because SJ-Games abuses a lot of HTML Elements for different meanings. :(

This Style uses the new -moz-colums CSS extension that will be in CSS 3.0. For now you need Firefox 3.0 and greater, for the 2 Column Layout.
