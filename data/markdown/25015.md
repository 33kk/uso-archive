### Description
Intrepid style. "NYPMBlue" is node 278939
http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=278939

That node hadn't been updated to reflect my tweaks in a while, but basically this Stylish style, is like that style on perlmonks.

Please note: the Licensing has changed! See CSS file for details. But anyhow now licensed under the dual "Artistic" / GPL3+ arrangement, to be uniform with the rest of the GitHub collection (see "Additional Info").
