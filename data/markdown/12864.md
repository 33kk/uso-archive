### Description
3.0+ (3.1 compatible)
Designed for Vista. May or may not work with other operating systems. Please let me know.

This style does a few things to the tab bar.

1. Tabs now hang from the top of the bar.
2. The space below the tabs acts as a natural border allowing the default border to be removed (saving a few vertical pixels).
3. Tabs are thinner (saving a few more vertical pixels), but still have room and comfortable padding for favicons.
4. Tab corners are more rounded.
5. Tab corners become less rounded when selected or hovered.
6. All-tabs and New-tab button appearances are also changed to match.
7. Dotted border around selected tab text is removed.

Suggestions/Criticism welcome.

I recommend using this style with the Glasser and Personal Menu addons.
