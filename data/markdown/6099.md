### Description
The BBC News website was recently redesigned, which introduced unnecessary whitespace all over the page (increased line spacing, etc) and made the main text a less legible grey.

This fix will change the text colour back to black, and also removes a lot of the wasted space around the site.  I don't expect it to be by any means complete, but for those who liked the old site better this should be something of a reprieve.
