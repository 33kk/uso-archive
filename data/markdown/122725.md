### Description
The c2.com wiki is an unvaluable source of information (often in form of ThreadMode ramblings) about programming; however, in its default form (HTML 3.2 without any CSS) was often a bit hard on the eyes, especially on larger monitors.

Even after the recent-ish update, the visual style is not particularly appealing.

This style attempts to bring a nice, simple style to the site; the body is limited in size to 800px and centered, the font is set to Georgia and the links are set to shades of orange. Also some drop-shadow is added to the central column, just because.
