### Description
Removes some elements from comments pages that are commonly used to reveal who took the screenshot. Like (edit) below comments and many other things. <b>It is very highly recommended for you to disable subreddit CSS and both RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and reddit moderator toolbox, if those extensions are enabled for your browser.</b>

### Update notes
<b>It is very highly recommended for you to disable subreddit CSS and both RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and reddit moderator toolbox, if those extensions are enabled for your browser.</b>

---

This is to help get many of the catchmes like the (edit) below your own comments if you participated in a discussion and other missable elements that have gotten people outed in the past.

<u><b>!!!  IMPORTANT !!!</b></u>

You need to DISABLE subreddit styles (as some subreddits have special CSS designed to catch leakers).
https://www.reddit.com/prefs/ -> Display Options -> []allow subreddits to show me custom themes

There are hidden, secret CSS watermarks in some subreddit styles that will reveal your username.

<b>!!! CAUTION !!!</b>

It is up to you to verify screenshot afterwards, CSS elements are subject to change in the event reddit's programmers modify their own website.  

Rare, Moderator, & Gold elements may be missed. 

Firefox has built in screenshotting: 

firefox instructions; shift-f2, screenshot --clipboard --fullpage 

Chrome, I personally use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-minus/bnophbnknjcjnbadhhkciahanapffepm?hl=en-US">Awesome Screenshot Minus</a>

Using this style will add a url to the top of the comments page to this stylesheet to encourage others to use it. It is commented and can be removed or changed.
