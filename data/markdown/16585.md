### Description
Come April fools they turned their css to reflect a pink theme that burned my eyes and made it un-playable. so in an act of desperation I was forced to dive into their css and alter it back to readable. Unfortunately I learned a sad truth that cclub was founded on a "Framework" which makes a complete mess of everything and you end up with repeated styles that overwrite other styles. While I can't fix the horrible framework implementation I did manage to make the site readable in the sense that it no longer abused my eyes with bright pink. I did not cover every feature or page and I did not intend to do so. This userstyle is just to get by for now but who knows I might progress with it or spawn off a real redesign.
