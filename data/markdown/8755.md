### Description
Recolors most of the FriendFeed UI, replacing the white backdrop and intense blues with an easier-on-the-eyes pallet of white on black, with soft blue links. The logo is replaced by a slightly recolored version, which fits better on the dark backdrop. Replaced images are embedded directly in the style sheet to save bandwidth and resolve privacy concerns. Friends' comments are highlighted to increase visibility.

The latest version is Build 6, updated July 19th, 2008.
* Fixed compatibility with a recent FF design changes.
