### Description
This is the style I used to use which some people asked for. I might fix things, but it isn't a priority. It is based off of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/101950/dundealstylish-pokemon-showdown-layout"> DunDealStylish</a> by <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/265790">DunDealShowdown</a>. I added lots of transparencies and a custom background. I unfortunately could not find the artist who made the background. I would like lots of feedback! Please leave me some!
