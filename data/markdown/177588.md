### Description
This stylesheet removes dead space around the image.
Note that even if your adblocker hides the space used by the ads (the "dead" space at the top of the screen in the screenshot), it doesn't make the image use the whole space. This stylesheet does.

After installing the style, reload the page or exit the mediaviewer page if it's the current page.

<b>Update 2020-07-06:</b> IMDb is implementing a new design. Depending on your cookies, you are given one of the 2 layouts.<br>
The stylesheet has been updated for the new design: hiding the header (menu and search field) and the footer of the page and recovering the space used by the top bar (back button and # of image).
The top bar will stay visible all the time. Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://greasyfork.org/scripts/406544">userscript version</a> to hide it.
