### Description
This style makes the stream slightly more compact and reduces its font-size, but what made me want to share it is the neat image handling. The huge images in the stream are scaled down to a thumbnail, and when you hover over one, it smoothly scales up to size. The last part requires a modern enough browser to handle CSS animations, of course.
