### Description
In June 2008 Wikia decided to insert advertising inside the article space on their wiki pages. Since the wiki communities are hosted at no cost to the community members this is reasonable.

Notwithstanding the above, if you find those advertising blocks annoying then this style is for you.

The class/id for these ads has changed a few times so if you notice this style no longer works as advertised (sic!) then please leave me a message/suggestion  and I'll keep it up to date with any recent change.
