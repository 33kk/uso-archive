### Description
Auto-Hides the Firefox Sidebar until you hover your mouse over it.

This style is an Entirely new take on the Previously-Attempted auto-hide side bar styles.  This style works and performs Amazing!

* Thanks to user 1573 AND user 5732 for the Similar Ideas and Code

Instructions:
1. Install the style
2. Move your mouse over to the right-hand side of screen
3. Slowly move your mouse over towards the Sidebar until the RESIZE icon appears as your mouse icon
4. Resize the sidebar to be as small as you can make it.
5. Enjoy the smallest sidebar when browsing, and when you hover over it, it will become un-compressed!

Customizations:
+ This style also allows you to customize the size of the sidebar when it is hovered over.  Currently it is at 500px but it can be increased or decreased easily in the code (look for my comments)

Applies to:
+ Web page in a sidebar
+ History Sidebar
+ Bookmarks Sidebar
+ Stylish Sidebar
+ Countless other sidebars, All automatically compacted and compressed!
