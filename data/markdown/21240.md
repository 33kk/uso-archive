### Description
This userstyle emulates the suggested "Progress Line" on tabs in FF 3.7/4.0 mockups, this is a further refinement of my previous version for the FF 3.7 Mockup Redux theme.

This style modifies Tab Mix Plus: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122 it's required to make it work.

This userstyle was designed to be used in conjunction with the Strata40 Theme version 0.4.3 by SpewBoy at http://spewboy.deviantart.com/art/Strata40-v0-4-3-132191373

Works in other themes as well but editing of the margins will be required.
