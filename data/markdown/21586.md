### Description
Default Vkontakte style is fixed-width and overloaded, therefore, it sucks.
This style tries to use wide layout and floating blocks to provide user as much screen space as possible.

SR4.3: Some code pieces are retweaked. If new things look bad, comment code under "new features" headline. Also, now it's easy to disable tweaks. Colors could be changed easily, too, unfinished example is provided.
