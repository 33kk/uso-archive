### Description
This is a skin for the popular german website www.heise.de. Since I often find myself working late in the night I prefer darker color themes. So much for me. I also removed unnecessary ads (basically a collection of the elements the other available cleaners removed). I think the screenshots will speak for itself.

Additional notes: 
-Thanks go out to thespook whose skin http://www.userstyles.org/styles/799 for www.deviantart.com insipred me to make this skin right here.

-Im aware of the inconsistencies in the stylesheet when you happen to read a news item connected to the cebit. I'm too lazy to cope with this right now since the cebit is a "once-in-a-year" event. I`ll possibly will edit that later but dont nail me down on that. :)
