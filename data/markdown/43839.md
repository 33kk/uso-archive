### Description
Like many of you, I despise change, and the new Gawker layouts have change all over the place. So I took it upon myself to make the new Gawker look as much like the old Gawker as possible. I whipped this up in a few hours and it may be prone to quite a few errors. Once this style is applied, I actually like it better than old Gawker. There's probably a cleaner way to accomplish everything that I did, but I'm no web designer. I'm just a college student who reads a lot of lifehacker and kotaku.

Upon installing this style, click the newspaper icon at the top right of whatever Gawker site you're viewing to be directed to the blog.*******.com equivalent of the site, as that is the version of the site that this style is coded for.

This style is actively updated, so if you encounter any bugs, feel free to comment and I'll try to fix it.
