### Description
Just a few tweaks I've been forced to gather as the bastards at Cond√© Nast force reddit to reach a wider audience for more pageviews and more ad revenue at the expense of alienating us users that have been around since the beginning.  Gets rid of the top subreddit bar, the new "sponsored link" BS, and the sideboxes.  Combine this with the compressed link display option in your preferences and you have reddit the way it should be, as close to the original as possible without me having to do a lot of work.  To submit links just go to: http://[insert subreddit here].reddit.com/submit or http://reddit.com/r/[subreddit]/submit.
