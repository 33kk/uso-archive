### Description
Simple about:blank theme meant to blend with patrickjdempsey's wonderful FennecFox theme (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/49589).  The logo used here was the original logo suggested for fennec before it became firefox for mobile.  I removed the jpeg artifacts and blurred it a little so it's not so sharp.  Even if you don't use the FennecFox theme, this is a good dark gray about:blank page with a logo that's hard to get tired of.  I've embedded the logo, too, so it should always work.

UPDATE 30 April 2010: Converted the image to 256 colors.  The images look almost identical, but the new image is 8 KB smaller than the first one.
