### Description
Hover your mouse over an image, and it will display in its full size.  This only works for images that have been resized in code (example: The preview images of Styles on UserStyles)

** Thanks goes to user 16 for the Image Resize idea, which is used in the style 127.  I made the code work on Width and Height as well, not just Max-width and Max-Height!!

Try it out!
Once you install the Style, head over to the page: Style 7875 and give it a try... Cool hey?

Functions:
- When you hover your mouse over an image that has been resized, it will display normally.

Applies to:
- Any image that has been resized by code
- max-width, preventing a full-width image
- max-height, preventing a full-height image
+ Just hover your mouse cursor over the image, and it will appear in it's original state (100% size, as if you were to save it to your disk.)

Browser Versions:
- Works on Firefox 2
- Works on Firefox 3

Additional Information:
+ This style works PERFECTLY on Userstyles.org for the Image Previews of the Styles!
+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.

Extension Compatability:
** For those of you using the Firefox Extension "Image Zoom" please comment or remove the following lines in the code:  
  height: auto !important;
  width: auto !important;
Thanks!

Changelog:

1.0.0.3:

1.0.0.2:

+ Thanks goes Entirely to user User 347 for reporting the problem, AND producing a fix.  (This update fix was all myf's code)
I thank you for the code, myf, and continual support of my styles.
