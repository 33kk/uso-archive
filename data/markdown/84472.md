### Description
I'm using GReader a lot, and knowing it will be discontinued, I had to find an alternative, here is a feedly style that make it look a bit more google reader. 
This is far from perfect, but I think it's already not too bad.
This is designed for 1920/1080 display and may/will not display properly on other resolutions.
It's a bit inspired of the excellent Mac OS X Lion userstyles for Google Reader from Allen Bargi.

Feel free to modify/fork do anything you want with it.
