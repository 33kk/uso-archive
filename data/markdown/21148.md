### Description
If you're using either the All-Glass or Glasser extension, you may have noticed the weird display issues with All-In-One Sidebar's transparency. 
I made this style to force the AIOS to "wear" a toolbar appearance, so that most of the Sidebar doesn't end up looking solid black. 

Unlike style 20412, which is similar, this style only "skins" the AIOS toolbar and sidebar header.

Looks great with the Strata40 theme by user 26618 (http://spewboy.deviantart.com/art/Strata40-Beta-v0-2-132191373).

Update 5-23-16
I can't believe people are still using this! Please leave a comment on how it can be improved, and I'll modify the code as needed.
