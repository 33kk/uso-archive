### Description
First: install this greasemonkey script that lets you style full nodes, not just tags: https://blog.workflowy.com/2016/05/19/different-fonts-for-different-workflowy-outlines/#more-1564

Then, use #qq or #sq to tag nodes as quotes (from a book or whatever). With #qq, the quote spans that project and all of its children. With #sq, just that one node is the quote. So child nodes can be reflections on that quote or whatever.

The #qq or #sq tags get hidden too, for maximum elegance.
