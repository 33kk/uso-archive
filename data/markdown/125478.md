### Description
Makes Thunderbird conform to the system theme for the tab bar and tool bars, removing Australis look. Tabs are taken from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/50950/thunderbird-5-gtk-tabs">Thunderbird 5+ GTK Tabs</a>, which also has an option for native toolbars but it doesn't work well with recent Thunderbird.

### Update notes
Tested with Thunderbird 38.4.0 on Linux, with Clearlooks theme.
