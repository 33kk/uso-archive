### Description
The lovely <a href="http://akeppleaday.tumblr.com/post/88690322237/i-cant-imagine-why-google-prefers-their-fifa" >AKeppleADay</a> posted a more... <i>realistic</i> Google Doodle for the World Cup. This plasters it on Google's homepage, because **** Google for not acknowledging it, that's why.

(I'm just cranking this out now, so for right now it only affects the homepage and Chrome's New Tab page. I'll be back in a bit for all of Google. If you have an issue with it, I'm <a href="http://thetransintransgenic.tumblr.com">TheTransInTransgenic</a> on Tumblr.)
