### Description
Clickbait, obnoxious titles, brain-dead comments, emotionally charged rhetoric, all-caps screaming -- their only objective is to rudely invade your mind and influence your thoughts by preying on your lesser impulses. Even mellow YouTube pages aren't quiet! HushTube no longer display titles or comment text unless you first hover over them.

Regain control on your terms. Maintain peace and high-minded contemplation. No sensory overload. No unwanted voices forcing entry into your mind. In the escalating conflict, this is your first line of defense.

Inspired by, and recommended with the Shut Up Chrome extension -- for total pest eradication.
