### Description
I wrote this script to fix a couple of problems that had been bothering me:

* When voting on a comment, it is too easy to accidentally click the commenter's username instead of the arrows, taking you away from the page you're on.
* In threads with a lot of comments, it can sometimes be difficult to tell which comment is a child of which.

I solved the first issue by slightly increasing the space between a commenter's username and the voting arrows, and adding a hover effect to make it obvious when you move the cursor over a commenter's name. The second was resolved by color-coding comments depending on their level.
