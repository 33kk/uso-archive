### Description
This is my second complete rip-off of srazzano's - http://userstyles.org/users/1573 - Tab Busy (Spinning Firefox Logo) - http://userstyles.org/styles/2585 - with a prettier gif (well, it's getting there, I'll probably update it again), also rendered in Base64. Since I re-used everything from his css w/ the exception of the base64 encoding, this will probably clash w/ his.
