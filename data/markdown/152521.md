### Description
First theme, dark and clean for save your eyes, build to the 7th december 2017.
I hope he will be futurproof, I don't really want to change it all time.
It's my first theme and I'm again a beginner, so he isn't really compact 542 lines, I could to optimize it to 250 lines I think, maybe soon.
