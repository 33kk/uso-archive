### Description
The original color scheme that Online Etymology Dictionary uses was far too bright for my tastes, so I spent a bit of time darkening the color scheme while basing it on some of the original shades of red. Despite my searching I wasn't able to find a decent anti-aliased version of the logo, so I made a quick & simple one in Photoshop instead.

The font I used is Optimus Princeps by Manfred Klein.
