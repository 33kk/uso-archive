### Description
Scout.com has now become FoxSportsNext. For those of you who frequent the message boards, it looks awful. It's almost unusable. With this I'm fixing the layout issues and making it more pleasant on the eyes.

Now added support for choosing your own page background color and alternating post background color! Select this when installing!

******************
Important Note:
Because this style allows you to select your own background color, the automatic update in Firefox and the Check for Updates button in Chrome don't work. If there are updates here, you will need to delete and re-install the style to get the latest updates. I will be sure to post the date and versioning information below so you can tell if you have the latest version. 
******************

SELECT BACKGROUND COLORS, THEN CLICK INSTALL.

### Update notes
1.1 - 10/8/12 - Added support for choosing page background color and alternating post background color. Updates to page width, padding tweaks, capitalization issues and added comments to show where to change page and post background colors the code.
1.2 - 10/8/12 - Fixed bug with background color showing in Reply Box on Rich Text Editor
