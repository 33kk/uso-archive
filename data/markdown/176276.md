Sure, coffee can be taken black
But cola's nicer

### Update notes
Update 1 - Changes on their end required changes on mine, so they were changed.
Also, the home page was added to this change, since it was forgotten in the initial release, whoops...

Update 2 - Big changes from them roughly an hour before writing, if I missed something let me know!

Update 3!
- Been a while! Things changed, so I changed em now, should be more of a solid dark experience going forward. I have little reason to check back to the site too much so it falls behind. If you wanna see it keep up to date more, be sure to support to give me a reason to return!
- Made notifications dark
- Updated some icons that weren't dark
- Updated the Kola icon
- Updated dashboard, either an error or an oversight on my part broke something
- Updated the currency dropdown
- Updated the text input page
- Added a dark scrollbar

Update 4
- So, right after I thought I updated the style, either I missed a whole lot or it was changed again. Things should be more complete now
- Updated the Edit Page window
- Updated the Create a Post stuff
- Updated the text on a Post
