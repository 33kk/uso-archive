### Description
Fun Fact!
Chrome has a built in Picture in Picture Mode, but why doesn't work on every site?
Well its a lot variables, some could be because UI or other elements that hover over the video player are in the way. Some sites disable right click all together.

But as long as a video uses the standard video html tag then this should work.
Only catch is disable it if you want the video to resume using the original controls on the initial player. 

Best way to remember, ON when you want to use it, OFF when you're done.
Once ON just right click the video and pick Picture in Picture.


Also I make these CSS stuff for myself but sometimes friends would come over and ask how I did that or how'd you do this. So I'd figure I give out my stuff for free. But.....

Yup there's a big ol' butt!
If you'd like to support me so I can keep making these on my free time here's my donorbox link:
