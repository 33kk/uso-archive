### Description
This makes all the controls and the tabs in Firefox 4.0 have the Aero Glass effect. Plus there are a few other tweaks such as hiding the bookmark bar text, removing the new tab "+" icon from the last tab and styled the add on bar a bit.

I've since found this user style that compliments mine: http://userstyles.org/styles/40815/firefox-4-full-glass-addonbar-statusbar There are details below in the change log if you care to implement it as I have.
