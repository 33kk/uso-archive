### Description
Makes the new Tweakers.net website more stylish and usable. This style includes: grey background, some gradients removed, smaller menu bar with rounded corners, tracker blends with the grey background, smaller paddings around the articles/topics on the frontpage and forums, colors in the forum headers.

Some unnecessary elements have been hidden (social buttons, newsletter form etc.)

Images have been uploaded to TinyPic because they were too big.
