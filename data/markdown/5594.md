### Description
This is the css section from Sean Watson's greasemonkey script. 

http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11552

It's not 100% identical (there are still a few things that need to be worked on like the filter section doesn't look right and the buttons and search box are not styled) but it should stop the page jumping about when the page is loading.

Again... I did not make this, I just copied the css from Sean's script and put it in this stylesheet.
