### Description
Save your beautiful eyes from the blinding white background and ancient design of Skyward with my custom dark theme CSS style. Additional changes are included to modernize the site. (such as removed the borders on Gradebook, Schedule, etc.)

Enjoy!

★ Skyward+ theme now replaces the original (ugly) icons on the site with more modern designs from the Silk iconset, created by FamFamFam (Mark James).

★ The scrollbar on all pages now disappears instead of greying out if there's nowhere to scroll (as most sites do)

★ Made default table text slightly lighter now.

★ Fixed the dark background not showing up on the initial loading screen. Your eyes are safe once again...

★ Show/Hide charts button under Attendance is now dark themed! :)

★ Fixed the body container border on Home being unbalanced.

★ FusionCharts captions (e.x. the Attendance graph) are lighter now.
