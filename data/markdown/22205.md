### Description
This is based off of Dark TokyoTosho style 13496 by user 14255.  Since it no longer works, I've fixed it and tweaked a few things I didn't like about it.

Makes the Tokyo Toshokan domains dark and easier on the eyes.  Font size has been adjusted slightly.  Mouse-over links have the overline.  In the Details pages, the seeders/leechers numbers are colored and bigger .  It now references all domains: .com, .info, .net, and .se (all include https, www2, and www3).  It should be of note that the .com domain is no longer in use.  I'll try to update if anything breaks, otherwise leave a comment/discussion via the button at the bottom of the page.  Tested with Stylish on Firefox, user script extension on Chrome, and javascript file on Opera.

Version with most elements hidden here: style 32030.
