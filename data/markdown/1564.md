### Description
Windows Vista font settings for NetVibes, so we non-Vista users can have the beauty of Calibri and Consolas (which are much easier on the eye than Arial and Courier, so less eyestrain â€” Yay!) across NetVibes.

You'll need Calibri and Consolas installed, which you can find on ForeverGeek.com at http://forevergeek.com/windows/new_microsoft_fonts.php

This doesn't affect the summary tooltips, but might do when I get round to it  ;o)
