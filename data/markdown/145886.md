### Description
A compact theme for the MDN.

Recently, mozilla did a complete redesign of the MDN. I find it pretty, but it eats a lot of screen real estate. The worse offender is on mobile, where the website basically looks like crap, but even tablet and desktop users are left with a lot of wasted space.

This theme tries to recover this lost space by moving some stuff around. On mobile, it removes search and menues. I'll try to put them back in if I find the time.
