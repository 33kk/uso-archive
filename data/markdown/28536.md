### Description
A simple, clean Firefox-themed skin for Google.

This features a big styling change from my other theme. For starters, the image is anchored so that the text kind of scrolls over it, so the darn thing doesn't have to repeat, which makes it just look hideous. Some other small things include some redone colors for the link text, descriptions, URLs and Cached and Similar links to make the theme look more sleek. There are also some other things that have been recolored, but those are mainly things that you don't usually notice. Still, they're like the bass in a song-you can't see much of it, but without it, it's not as good. :D

Due to my browser's unique Persona which involves an array of colors, the "After" screenshot's file size is immense, far bigger than Userstyles' 75KB limit. So, to check it out, hit this link: http://gyroxopex.deviantart.com/art/Google-Firefox-Outline-Theme-161165856
