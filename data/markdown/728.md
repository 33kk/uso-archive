### Description
This style removes some ads (sponsored links) on the Google results page and gives Google a new appearance.
Seems to look good on the search page results. Tested with Firefox 2, not with Opera.

You can also try the style 1082 style, which is a fork of this one and of the style 640 one. You can also try the much more beautiful but less ad blocking style 1781.

Bellow the details:
  - recolorization of links (link, active, visited and hover) to the colors of the Google logo,
  - add an indent for the text below the URL of the result,
  - relax the width of the results to optimize the use of the available vertical space (less scrolling),
  - add a round border to each result with a blue background,
  - add an hover effect that makes this background and its border respectively switch to yellow and red (Google logo colors again).

Changelog (19/05/2010):
  - fix the total result width to 100% after the big Google look-and-feel refresh (margin-right set to 0px)

Changelog (25/08/2009):
  - fix the total result width to 100% (broken after a small Google update)

Changelog (23/12/2008):
  - apply (lately, sorry â€¦) the fix proposed by user 13778 (thanks to him)
  - globally change all 'div.g' in '.g' selectors to be more change proof (Google has improved their page with a <ol> <li> structure)
  - add another correction to prevent unnecessary line-break (disable max-width of the class 's')
  - remove the 2px border on :hover to avoid the little sliding effect

Changelog (27/03/07):
  - add compatibility with Google preview extension for Firefox
  - compact style for the <a> tag

Changelog (26/03/07):
  - apply some of the corrections made by user 823 in his style 1082 style both on CSS and domain where applied
  - add some domains added in style 1082
  - refactoring of add blocking to be more specific
  - restrict the use of this script to only Google search results page
