### Description
This changes how the header on http://tf2outpost.com works by making it so when you scroll down your links are always at the top of the page with you :)

update - I missed Hall of Fame :>
update - 03/07/13 New TF2outpost style, updated style for tf2outpost's html5 update :)
update - 27/07/13 Completely re-wrote the code seems to load faster and worth a bit better (keeps the network section up the top now)
update - 10/10/13 updated to fit with the tf2outpost update ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tf2outpost/announcements/detail/2127115164787979376 )
