### Description
Dark theme for trello.com with optional enhanced layout settings.

Settings are as follows:

Display card counts? - If yes, displays a count for the number of cards in a list just under the list title.

Display card identifiers? - If yes, displays unique numeric identifiers at the start of the card's title.

Smaller margins/less padding? - If yes, decreases the margins and padding on the board to slightly increase the total amount of information displayed.

Wider card details window? - If yes, increases the size of the card details window. (this is most beneficial on larger resolution screens)

Double-width lists? - If yes, makes lists wider and creates two columns of cards within them.

Responsive list wrapping? - If yes, wraps lists into multiple rows instead of forcing you to scroll horizontally.
