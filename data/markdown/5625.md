### Description
Thats what it does, assuming it works. I currently have it set up to just make them white, because I found the extra spaced made it easier to scan the results. Also, this way one can see them on mouseover, if necessary. I also made the common ones larger and the normal ones lighter. I would like to have a way to remove the excess commas, but this does not appear possible with the current code RhymeZone uses.
