### Description
[Deprecated] Se7ensins is now very close to this style by default! ðŸ¤©

A highly custom and better dark theme than the default shit.
Loads of other improvements etc. Pick your own color theme!

### Update notes
Start off by using Se7ensins defualt light theme, then apply this!
Click Advanced style settings if you want to mod the themes colours. 
Read about the colors bellow if you don't understand them. 

Might take a few tries to make your colors just right! :)

===============================================

Anything with the name BG at the end is a background colour for something.
â€“ Color #1 should be lighter than #2, else it may end up looking weird.
â€“ If color #1 and #2 is light, you may want to pick a darker #3, since main text color will go against color #1 and #2.
â€“ You should generally not mess with #3 unless necessary. If you do, you may need to change #6.
â€“ #4 is the theme color. This color will be everywhere. #5 is the same color, only slightly darker/lighter for hover effects and such.
â€“ #6 is the text that will go on your theme color(s) #4 and #5.
â€“ Color #7 is the color of your marking. When you mark text, that's the background color.
â€“ Color #8 is the color of the text when marking said text, so pick a color that is readable over #7.

- Color #9 is the daker text-link color. Used on the secondary navbar "Mark Forums Read, Search Forums, Watched Forums, Watched Threads, New Posts". Recommended keeping dark (if dark theme), but lighter than the #1 color.

======[ Custom images ]======
The custom "logo" option allows you to replace the current logo with your own.
Note that the code is only optimized for it to be of same size, with the main intent for you to change the colours of the default logo to fit your own color theme.

The same goes for forum images.
For example for myself, I have changed the green in the default logo and forums icon to be red to fit my own theme. Change it yourself, upload to an image host and the paste the link to make it replace those for you.
