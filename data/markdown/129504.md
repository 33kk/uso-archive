<title>Changelog</title><code>
v0.6.2b - 30th May 2017
- - - - - 
Sorry for the delay guys :( 
*don't expect a new update anytime soon, this theme has gotten so big it just seems impractical editing it in a single file. I plan to make myself a more fluid environment to edit in which should allow me to push out an update the moment I'm happy with it :)

- Added ONE extra recent game (Home)
- Rearranged Profile Page
- Added Sidebar for Games page
- Adjusted Messages page, better functionality
- New Avatar page!

- Fixed Game Card text
- Fixed scaling issues on Game page
- Fixed search suggestion background
- Fixed issue that didn't allow people to opt out of Icons8

 * There are still some theme issues which affect people who have changed the colour scheme of this theme. I will work on this when using the new dev environment, but for now try and stick to brighter colours c;
