### Description
Tidies the GalaxyZoo forum.

* Fits it to the browser's full window width.

In topic index pages:

* Adds the 'locked & sticky' marker into the 'subject' column of such topics.
* Sets background-color of the 'subject'- and 'lastpost' columns of sticky- and/or locked topics to a darker gray.
* Sets the background-color of the 'icon1' 'icon2' and 'stats' columns to the same, dark, gray throughout.
* Matches separator lines' color to the page's background.
* [optional] - Make (background-color of) the 'Today' marker stand out more.
* [optional] - Move a subject's 'new' label to its left. Correct light background mismatch.

In posts:

* For [code]-ed content; Fixes colors to grey-on-white; Matches font-size to normal text. Enlarges max-height to about 100 lines (was: 24);
* [optional] - Removes the implicit blank line below [quote]-ed content.
* [optional] - Hides chatterbox status; i.e. the 'Newbie/...whatever' label, the stars bar and the count of total posts made.

### Update notes
2011-05-28: Changed said third option to slightly adjust the two icon columns' widths. (screenshots not yet updated)
2011-04-27: Added a third option to move the 'new' label into the column before the subject, effectively replacing the icon that's normally there.
2011-04-26: Made the "today" marker also stand out on board index page.
2011-04-25: Added optional feature to move a subject's 'new' label to its left. This also fixes the ugly rendering to a lighter background than the forum  has.
