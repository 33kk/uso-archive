### Description
This style is meant to improve the looks of articles on wikipedia (who would've thought that?) while maintaining all functionality. Almost all of it anyways - I have restricted the choice of languages to those I usually use and have hidden all others: English, German, French, and Spanish. But that's something you can change yourself within some seconds.
The searchbar and the bar on the left (whatever it's called) are accessible by moving the cursor to the top/left of the window. Both keep their place, so you can access them from anywhere on the page.
Readability is improved by limiting the width of the article and hiding all cluttering elements that might distract you from reading.
