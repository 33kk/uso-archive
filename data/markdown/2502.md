### Description
This styles adds a book icon in front of book results and an icon for pdf files (the icon which your specific system uses). Neat, huh?! :-)

This style makes it MUCH more clear which results are books and (more importantly?) which results are DIRECT links to pdf files. (see screenshots)  This makes searches infinitely more straightforward!  Also, I've found that it corrects the occasional Google mistake of identifying a pdf file as a "book."

Google Scholar is a great tool, and this style further improves its usability.  Best of luck with your research!!!

If you like this style, please refer to style 2486.

P.S. - I know that Google Scholar interacts with some universities to offer direct links to sites which that particular university has subscriptions to (a fantastic idea) - this MAY change the layout, and potentially break this style.  PLEASE leave a comment if you find this to be true (or not).  THANKS!
