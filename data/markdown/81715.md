### Description
Customizes the look of the delicious.com website after it has been relaunched in early 2013.
The fonts and colors are not final but more convenient then the defaults. Feel free to change them yourself. If you prefer GitHub you can fork my stylesheet here: https://gist.github.com/4567598
Make sure to set "Applies to: URLs on the domain: delicious.com" in the settings.
