### Description
Remove most of the crap on Reverso.net's pages (translation, context, dictionary, spell-check). Compared to Reverso Cleanup (1 & 2), this isn't a total cleanup: some features are left untouched on the page.
This userstyle is supposed to be used with AdBlock or Ghostery (I use both), but it seems to work well without them too.
I did what I could to preserve the original design of the page, but Reverso's CSS is rather messy, so I hope the result will be as good for you as it is for me. (It depends on the size of the page...)
You can comment the adaptive part of the code if you prefer to just hide the crap, and no other change on the page.
