### Description
We're back to the old Scout.com forums. Here's an upgrade to make the user interface a little more friendly and modern looking. 

Features:
- No Fox/MSN Headers or Footers
- No Ads
- Full IC website navigation locked at the top
- Forum Action tools locked all into one tool bar (New Topic, Quick Reply, Forum List, Profile Menu, Inbox, etc). Stays put when you scroll so you never need to go to top or bottom to access them
- Thread/forum navigation & breadcrumbs all in one toolbar locked at the bottom. Stays put when you scroll so you never need to scroll to top or bottom to access them
- Post background alternating colors on all forums (like the ZZL)
- Quick Reply from anywhere in the page. You don't have to scroll to the bottom. 
- More to come!
