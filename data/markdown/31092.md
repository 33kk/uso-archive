### Description
I have found one excellent (free) aggregator of non-fluffywuddlekins positive news stories, and that is Global Good News.  Unfortunately, despite its aggregation being completely neutral, it has a rather heavy transcendental meditation site design.

This takes individual news stories reprinted on the site and strips it down to the bare essentials.  Used in concert with style 31087 for the news summary itself, this removes most of the TM design from the site, leaving it quite plain and distraction-free.

I'm mostly putting this on Userstyles.org to serve as a backup in case I ever lose it off my system.  Given that the site uses nearly no CSS markers, this userstyle is almost entirely constructed using a combination of DOM Inspector and InspectThis to do a workaround that's mostly based on zapping particular cells within the site's table layout.

Thus, should GGN shift their site's layout around, this is extremely fragile and almost certain to break.  If it does break and I've not fixed it yet, drop me a line.  If I'm no longer checking the page at that future point in time, I may not want to invest the time to fix it up ... but who knows?  I *have* commented this script, though, so that hopefully it'd be a quick job in the future to pinpoint the area that broke and fix it.
