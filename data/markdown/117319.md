### Description
Many DA members HATE the new CORE symbol, also known as DragonBall. I made a little tidbit which hides the new ugly CORE (premium and beta-tester), and inserts the old symbols, full star and outlined star behind usernames. It shows tool-tip like it used to, the color might be a little off in some places, but otherwise looks like it used to. The style works on deviantart.com and sta.sh. If you find any bug, or the style stops working, contact me (if you can't fix it yourself)! Confirmed working on Firefox and Android (Firefox). Thanks to BoffinbraiN and electricjonny on DeviantArt for fixes!
