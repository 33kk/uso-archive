### Description
Besides making <i>opensubtitles.org</i> dark, it applies numerous improvements:
<ul>
  <li>• <b>Font</b> with better legibility (Roboto)
  <li>• <b>Removed</b> annoying/unnecessary elements
  <li>• Supports <b>background images</b> (click CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS) and select one)
  <li>• <b>Links</b> are underlined only while hovered
  <li>• <b>Icons</b> with poor transparency are rounded or inverted for good legibility on dark ground
  <li>• Increased <b>whitespace</b> in tables, because they looked very squashed.
</ul>

### Update notes
<b>Advice:</b>: Increase zoom to 120% - 130% for better legibility! (<kbd>Ctrl +</kbd>)

I made this style because I hate to open a dazzling bright website after a movie with dimmed lights. I hope you find this style useful, too.

Please note that I don't have an opensubtitles account, so there might be bugs while you're logged in.
