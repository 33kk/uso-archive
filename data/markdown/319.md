### Description
Although my mother tongue version of Wikipedia is fourth biggest of all the Wikipedias I always check article in English - this is because English one is the biggest and most comprehensive Wikipedia. But it is a bit annoying to scroll down the site when looking for the appropriate links.
This tweak places link from English version of Wikipedia to my language version article just over the article title and at my language version — link to English version article over the article title.

1. due to some CSS limitations — below script needs minor adjusting to suite well your monitor size and custom font size regulations — in case the link being misplaced - adjust the values of "top" and "left" in lines marked below
2. this is THE POLISH VERSION — it needs little change when applied to other language - you have to change "div.pBody>ul>li.interwiki-pl" to your language version: i.e. french one will be "div.pBody>ul>li.interwiki-fr", spanish — "div.pBody>ul>li.interwiki-es", german — "div.pBody>ul>li.interwiki-de", dutch — "div.pBody>ul>li.interwiki-nl" and so on...
