### Description
Based on rouzbeh84's gitLAB Midnight Mariner(https://userstyles.org/styles/144875/gitlab-midnight-mariner) theme, I bring to you a Discord themed style.
To be clear, this is a simple edit and I am by no means an expert on this, so there may be issues which I may or may not fix.

Feel free to edit as you please.
