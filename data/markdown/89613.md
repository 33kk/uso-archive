### Description
Shows Stack Exchange sites favicons next to various Stack Exchange site links in Google search results.  I find sites such as Stack Overflow, Server Fault, etc quite helpful, and this is designed to make those results stand out in a quick scan of the results list.

Comments and suggestions welcome.
