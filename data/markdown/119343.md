### Description
Choose which types of commercial and featured content to hide: third-party advertisements, promoted video suggestions (in the related videos area), the home page's featured video and the home page's featured stream. Ad blockers alone will only work on third-party ads and will leave whitespace where the ads were; this user style does not leave such whitespace.

### Update notes
