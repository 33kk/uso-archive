### Description
Tired of ads in Gmail? This style allows you to add more space to your email messages by removing the right-hand ads on the page. This style takes in consideration that you may have your gmail configured to have additional widgets on the right hand side (like chat or calendar): rest assured this style will NOT remove them. 

Enjoy!
