### Description
Brief info why I made this.
Currently I'm on iOS 10 on my iPhone SE and Robinhood no longer supports that OS version. I tried managing my stock through their website but the application will not adjust to mobile screen sizes, its a zoom in zoom out nightmare.


So I made this, it lines up everything vertically so no more zooming in and out. It also also the screen to be adjusted to smaller size. Now you can use the web app and actually be mobile friendly. 


TLDR;

In Mobile Mode:
- Vertical Alignment
- Hides News (will try to set a toggle via CSS if possible someday)
- Adjusts Width of all Windows
