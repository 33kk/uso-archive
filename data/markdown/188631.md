### Description
Brings back the final pre-Adventure version of WinWorld, introduced in August 2014. It also works pretty well as a dark theme, if that's what you're looking for. The forums are currently not affected by this style, but I am considering adding this in the future. This style is majestically powered.

### Update notes
Please let me know if you find any issues. I'll try to fix them ASAP.

The initial release of this style brings back the overall look of WinWorld from 2017 and earlier. This includes details such as:
-Dark elements, including buttons, input boxes, and alerts
-A heavy focus on orange and yellow accent colours
-Old WinWorld logo
-Starry header and footer graphics
-Category badges coloured and arranged just like the old site
-Product comment sections styled to match the rest of the site
-A classic look for pages that didn't exist on the old site
-Lots of other small details and adjustments to make the experience more authentic
