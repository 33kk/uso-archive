### Description
Every doodad on a web page is useful to somebody sometimes, but usually they're just clutter. This style hides the header, footer, and sidebars (and all their doodads) by reducing them to thin placeholders at the top, bottom, and left edge of the screen, and expands them again when you mouse over a placeholder. The author/poll sidebar is that dotted line above the article title. (No, me either...)

Nothing is removed from a page, only hidden at one of the edges of the screen. (Out of sight!)
