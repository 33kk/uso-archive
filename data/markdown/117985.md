### Description
This started as my own ad removal for <i>Yahoo Mail</i>, because the solutions I found were deficient.  My style does more than just clean up the mail webpage, it will affect other Yahoo pages!  It removes sponsored content and trends from Yahoo's homepage too (at least the content that is labeled as such). [Update: The login entries are contained in the box again.]
