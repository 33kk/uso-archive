### Description
<strike>With the introduction of a new Facebook chat in July 2011, lots of unconnected friends are now displayed in chat panel, which is quite useless. This style makes them less visible (lighter, lower, no profile icon) without removing them from the list.</strike>

<strike>If you prefer hiding them completely, try style 50938.</strike>

<strong>Facebook updated their code in February 2014. The new markup for the chat is unintelligible and the userstyle wonâ€™t work anymore. Sorry!</strong>
