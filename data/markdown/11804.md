### Description
Wikipedia - fainter inline cites.

This style should reduce the boldness of Wikipedia's inline citations, from code posted by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mzajac on 2008-11-03 on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Turn_off_display_of_in-line_cites_by_default

This style sheet modifies the appearance of Wikipedia articles such that it "will render citation references less conspicuous until you mouse over a paragraph, allowing you to still find and click them. To hide them completely, change “#CCC” to “transparent”.)" (words of Mzajac)
