### Description
These styles enable adjustment of the main colours on the teacher's Kahoot display. This is useful particularly where projector quality can make some text hard to read e.g. White on yellow usually used for the circle answer choices.
Modify the CSS variables at the top of the CSS to get your own choices. This version changes Yellow to Orange and set the main background and foreground colours to white on black.
Remember that colour choices on student devices will remain as standard.
