### Description
STINE is the online platform used by students of the University of Hamburg. The design looks outdated and can be improved upon. This userstyle provides a design more aligned with the design of the other University of Hamburg pages. This allows for a more colorful design instead of the varying greytones used in STINE otherwise.
