### Description
Style inspired by <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/98499/greasy-fork-hitchhiker">Greasy Fork "Hitchhiker"</a> and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/85708/userstyles-hitchhiker-dark-centered">Userstyles "Hitchhiker" DARK+CENTERED</a> (both by user <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/176333">Cruto</a>). Parts of the original Greasy Fork "Hitchhiker" style stylesheet and all of the images have been copied, however the style was severely broken with the current layout and is pretty hard to read in many places. Therefor I took some inspiration from the (working) Userstyles "Hitchhiker" DARK+CENTERED style and produced something that I think looks good :-)
