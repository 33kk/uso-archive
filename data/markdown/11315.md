### Description
For glasser mod. makes bookmarks bar BELOW tabs (without glass, with one of vista's toolbars), colors selected tab matching bookmark-bar, removes ugly borders. Some hove looks like style 10637 but more native-looking and more light-weight.

Recommended styles: MBlue's combine Back\Fwd\stop\reload for vista, styles that remove disabled forward\back buttons. Also looks great with default(not [Intenet]Explorer like). Also good advise: forget about searchbar, make keywords for searches, install omnibar, awesomerbar and so on.

this CSS may look like plagiary, but it was developed by me a lot earlier than style 10637 , as the say "hivemind"

Known bugs: 
addtab button is not styled

based on style 10771
