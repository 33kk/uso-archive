### Description
This hides everything but the player, chat frame, content status tabs, action links and stats, even the annoying meebo toolbar (the bottom toolbar).

Just a note: none of css styles will increase performance, elements are loaded but hided.
This style as been tested only in Firefox, but almost nobody who uses Internet Explorer install extensions =]
