### Description
This is an updated version of Valacar's style 845. Some of the updates are based on his style 1693.

Google Video updated their design and since he isn't planning on releasing a fix for a while, I thought I'd release this temporary fix. It's not done yet and there's a lot of old code, but at least it works.
