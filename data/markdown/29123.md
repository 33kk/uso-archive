### Description
I took my favorite style: http://userstyles.org/styles/12167 and changed the font to comic sans MS and adjusted some colors.  I needed something for my eyes to easily read.  Not for everyone for sure.  Also, my suggestion is to use: http://userstyles.org/styles/16695 and http://userstyles.org/styles/17353.  

There are things to fix but I have no idea how to do it... yet.
