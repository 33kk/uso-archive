### Description
I got tired of my eyes burning and feeling inflamed after using chess.com for much of the day. Save your eyesight with this ultra-dark style that removes much of the glaring bright white background on chess.com, at least on the Live Chess screen where many of us spend a lot of time. I am igor at http://techlorebyigor.blogspot.com and I code dark styles for several web sites. Wherever there is white, let us replace that with black. Note: I do not interfere with chess.com advertising. My focus here is on adjusting the brightness, nothing else. If you want a chess lesson then you can look me up on chess.com, and I just might lern you a lesson.
