### Description
Block entire websites in style!

When your room-mates/friends/significant others decide they want to use your computer to surf websites you've deemed a no-no (like celebrity news sites!) they'll be in for a writtle surrpriseeeee...

Add this to userContent.css and unlock the magical power of shutting everthing the f&*% off on a given domain. All the pages will be covered in a background color of your choice and display an image of your choice on top: anything from pleasantly polite hints to FULL CAPS PUNISHMENT UNLEASHED.

### Update notes
You have to go into the code to set up your own websites.

Instructions:
-------------
Find userContent-example.css or userContent.css in your browser's install folders.
Open it in a basic text editor (one that doesn't add formatting).
Add the code, and put in the website where it says /* EDIT the website in the line below. */
Save and you're good to go.
