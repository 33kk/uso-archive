### Description
Based on style 4584.

Removes all ads, but keeps important buttons like "Print all", "New window", "Expand all" and "Forward all"

Update (Feb 19 2008)
- Changed position of the "New window" and "Print all" links
*** I hope that this is the most rational solution. Elsewhere links hinder the basic elements of the interface. Please rank it! ***
