### Description
Re-skin of Demonoid. Lots of silver, and the Demon is RED.
Also removed some empty space & a few other annoyances.

Note: This WILL screw up the viewability of the Demonoid forums. 
This is due to Simple Machines Forum's hack-job CSS coding. 
I cannot do anything about this. 
I removed the Forums link from the main page though. 
So if you use Demonoid's forums, don't use this style.

Userstyles.org won't let me upload it cause it is waaaay 
too many characters, so you'll have to input it manually.
