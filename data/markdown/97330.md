### Description
about:home theme with background options & animated Firefox logo.

### Update notes
<i>(March 30th 2016 - will be updating this in the next few days, improved the logo, have different versions & sizes now, couple alternative search boxes, & colored buttons, also address the flaw in the search suggestion script, forcing to disable it in settings, simply removed it with css so they still appear in the navbar where they actually work, and replaced a third of the images with twice new ones, also working out default presets for each background which is holding it up</i>

• <u>Firefox logo & Position</u> - choose Hide if background name has 'nologo' & match positions to whats initialed   
• <u>Searchbox auto highlight</u> - to highlight on page load (auto focus), or only when hovered  
• <u>Searchbox brightness</u> - make it more or less transparent, eg 5% opacity means 95% transparent white     
• <u>Launcher buttons text</u> - options to improve visibility for different backgrounds
• <u>Searchengine button</u> - new feature that isnt really needed, just links to Options/Search
• btw if Firefox replaces the logo with gimicky animations <a href=http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=13821953#p13821953>heres</a> how to restore it

<i><b>Recommended addons</b></i>
• <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keyword-search/>Keyword Search</a> - to use a separate search engine on about:home
• <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/thumbnail-zoom-plus/>Thumbnail Zoom Plus</a> - to preview image links (not just thumbnails) on hover
• <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall>DownloadThemAll</a> - to batch download images and logo using the "DownloadThemAll (Current Tab)" option which auto selects image links; theyre not named but can shift-click to highlight them, rclick to choose "Renaming Mask" & change it to <code>*flattitle*.*ext*</code> to save with description names instead (except for logo gif & png). Then if saved to E:\Images for example, can use the local path url('file://E:/Images/xyz.jpg')
