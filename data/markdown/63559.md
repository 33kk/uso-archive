### Description
I did a user script of the site. Just simple edits and I like it so much better. Here's what I did: 

Moved over the left column to the edge, made it skinnier. 
Increased the main feed width, along with the text area in the main feed. 
Decreased the font size of pretty much everything. 
Increased profile picture size. 
Slight color changes: Workout points:purple, workout notes: purple 
Notification bubble is bigger 
Achievement/point bar stays up the whole time. 
Changed padding so badges in the feed are on the next line instead of wrapped. 
A few other things i don't remember.
