### Description
Like the original style 10526 by user 6482, this pokes fun at google with moz-transform. But if you use the addon "SearchPreview," (firefox) the preview images get messed up too. This rights the search preview images while maintaining the oh-so-fun messed up google homepage. It even works with darkgoogle styles and the new fade in effect!
