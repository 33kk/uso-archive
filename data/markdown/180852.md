### Description
I really like Octaber's orange-grey-black-ish colour scheme, but I prefer sharper and darker colours, so I introduced myself to CSS and edited some of the code to my liking. 

Compatibility:
This was just a very quick 1 to 2 hr edit, so although it is compatible with other styles, there are some flaws. But the main styles, hardcore mode and resizable textbox, should work fine with this style.

Use the dvorak discord server if there are any major issues with my code. You'll find me there.
