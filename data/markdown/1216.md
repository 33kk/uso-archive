### Description
Dataface is an excellent Application Framework for php and mysql. Since version 0.6.8 it has included the integration of an ajax based tree list for viewing child records. This style will let you strip away everything on the page except the tree list. It will even put a little box next to each item so you can print and check things off.

Enjoy.
Thank you kindly.
