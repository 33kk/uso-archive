### Description
This style changes the colors of tabs. The defaults for this theme:

Active: Light Orange
Hover: Light Blue
Inactive: Light Grey

______________________________________________________________________________


The tabs colors are customizable, just change the color code. For example, if you want to change the active tab:

/* active tab away */

.tabbrowser-tab[selected="true"],
.tabs-bottom,
[class="close-button tabs-closebutton"] {
  background-color: #6699bb !important;
}

Change "#6699bb" to a color from:

UPDATES:

Version 1.1 - Takes fills up space that is regularly unused; makes tabs look more like in Windows Vista by blending colors. In active tabs know blend into your theme. (edited code from http://userstyles.org/styles/11969)

Version 1.1.2 - Makes active tab have white text, which makes it stand out more.

______________________________________________________________________________

Future Improvements:

Tabs that have been unopened have colors too close to the actual theme.

Notes on the Picture:

I am using the "Strata Human" theme, therefore the close key is orange.
I am also using a style that changes the background, http://userstyles.org/styles/3874.
I am using one of my own styles in the after picture, which improves some basic tab GUI, http://userstyles.org/styles/11953.
Sorry for the bad picture quality, I saved it as a JPG, but it turned our I had to use a PNG, and everything got messed up.
