### Description
Gives you a coloumn view as you know it from facebook, etc.
The main reason for me to create this is that I liked to browse reddit from my phone more than on a computer, and I realized it's because the standard reddit page makes it less convenient to browse reddit due to the titles and comments stretched over the whole screen.

RES compatible
Messes with some subreddit custom styles, so you should definitely turn them off in your preferences page. IMO it's better that way, anyway. See this style as a way to browse reddit on your computer like you would on a smartphone.
