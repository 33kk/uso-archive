<h2 style="color:red;margin:0px;">AS OF 2018 YOUTUBE HAS CHANGED IT'S LAYOUT. THIS THEME IS INTENDED FOR THE OLD (pre-2018) DESIGN. THE NEW DESIGN DOESN'T MEAN THIS THEME IS BROKEN! YOU CAN STILL USE THE OLD DESIGN (check the settings or append "?disable_polymer=true" to the url).</h2>

You can now install my theme from <a href="https://rawgit.com/RaitaroH/YouTube-DeepDark/master/YouTubeDeepDarkClassic.user.css">Github</a> using Stylus.
