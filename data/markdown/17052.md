### Description
For the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

Black background.  All typography is executed with Palatino.  Plenty of type variation with italics, small caps, bold, all-caps.  Explanation body text is restricted to 600px wide, for better legibility.  Navigation links on bottom look like navigation links.  Body width is restricted to 900px to give the entire content some cohesion and bring the site out of 1998.

The style works well in other pages, like the calendar and archive, and also holds up for nearly every photo going back to 1996.  There are some quirks, like Flash content might have no top margin.
