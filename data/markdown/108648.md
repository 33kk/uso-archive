### Description
Changes the window buttons that show in F11 full screen, and are exposed by add-ons such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/htitle/">HTitle.</a>
Note that this does <i>not</i> mean the titlebar buttons shown normally.

### Update notes
The default margins should work fine, but may need to be tweaked if you have a ui-shrinking userstyle or similar (or are using the Pre-CSD Adwaita theme).
Requires a firefox version capable of using CSS variables (generally fx31+, idk how far along Pale Moon et al are).

These buttons are not my own work (obviously), they are borrowed from various themes which belong to their respective creators/owners.
The Non-PublicDomain license is just to ensure credit is given to the actual authors of the buttons, as well as this site lacking GPL licenses. For the code, feel free to copy etc.
