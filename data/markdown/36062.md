### Description
PLEASE RATE OR LEAVE A COMMENT AFTER TRYING, 

This Style improves the Firefox Speeddial plugin. It constrains the Icon size to a constant 96px square image. Scrollbars also appear when needed to navigate the icons, this is done to prevent the squishing found in the extension. Text has been centered and made more legible.

I use it with these options selected:
Don't show Dial Number in Label
Don't show Dial Icon 

This style is an ongoing project with the final version having a transparent background

Tested in Firefox 4.0b4 Win 7 U - 64bit
