### Description
Simple CSS that hides left toolbar from new Facebook Messenger (and open it on hover) and allow to make new chat a lot smaller

### Update notes
Hint: The main reason for making the style was to make messenger look more like normal dekstop chat app, so on chromium I suggest you to go to hit menu button, "more tools" and next "create application shortcut". Now you can run messenger that will look like normal chat window (without address bar and so..)
