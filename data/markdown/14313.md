### Description
Adds custom highlights for the "Silver Lining" color theme of gmail2, basically making it darker overall.

Close to Gmail's "Contrast Black" theme, which I don't use because I think the yellow links color just doesn't work.

Pardon poor documentation / lack of acknowledgements; this is very much w-i-p.
As you can see from the before/after shots, the font colors need improvement!
