### Description
Better design for <a href="http://fitgirl-repacks.site">FitGirl Repacks</a>

<ul>

<li>Site container is now centered and stretched to 1600px (was 1280)</li>

<li>Some colors changed. Say no to strange purple titles</li>

<li>Search panel in top menu is wide and clean now. Search from left menu removed</li>

<li>Some font sizes was changed. Long phrases in left bar are replaced with shorter ones, so we can make the font bigger and some accurate</li>

<li>Left menu duplicates links from top, so it's hidden by default. You can turn it back with style settings</li>

</ul>

Known bugs:

<ul>
<li>First element in left menu is unavailable when search panel from top menu opened. This bug comes from original design, I will try to fix it later</li>
</ul>
