### Description
This stylesheet is for the newly-redesigned MLB Trade Rumors site.  It makes only minor changes to the look of the site:

- The color of the links in the header are modified; it also changes the "Contact" link to red upon hovering (as a warning that the link opens up an external mail program).
- The "Full Story" and "Comments" links under each story are bolded, so as to stand out from the numerous "category" links.
- Under each comment, the poster's name is bolded.
- The "MLBTR Mailing List" box on the right-hand sidebar is hidden from view.
