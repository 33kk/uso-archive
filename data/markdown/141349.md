### Description
Changes the theme of <b>chan.sankakucomplex.com</b> to a rather coherent, darker one, while keeping the original 'soul' of the website. Multiple color options and header options available. Also centers pictures and videos, and resizes them sanely - generally better formatting. Modifies (probably) all types of pages properly, and removes ads.
