### Description
This style will hopefully make any website purely black over white. Unfortunately images will still show up colored (until Mozilla came up with a gray scale filter for images, that is). I suggest this in addition to ImgLikeOpera and FlashBlock, so your browsing experience will never feel bloated and anyone watching over you will have a hard time realizing that you're navigating or just editing a document.
