### Description
Compacts Twitter timeline by showing attachments and embedded items —photos, videos, Twitter cards, quoted tweets— as thumbnails and labels from which to trigger floating popups on MouseOver. Also acts on promoted tweets and trends.

### Update notes
MouseOver to show all attached items, Photos, Videos, Twitter cards, Quoted tweets, as popup.
MouseOver to show minimized promoted tweets as slide.

This style sheet affects only tweets on the timeline, not individual tweets opened on modal overlaying.
Note media players won't stop on popup close, so stop them manually specially if they play in loop, or hear them in background while you read other tweets until they finish

Vote twitter cards are excluded because I felt somehow weird when I saw Popup-Vote.
