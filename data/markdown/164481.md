### Description
userstyles.org crops the screenshot and there is no good way around this. <a href="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/164481_after.png">Uncropped version</a>

Removes all views, likes, and subscription numbers from Youtube for a cleaner experience without pre-judgements.


"I don't think there's any disagreement that Netflix would be worse if they had view numbers next to all of the shows, it causes you to prejudge... [With Youtube] you can't come to it just as a thing to be consumed and taken on its own" - CGP Grey, Hello Internet Podcast #109

Inspired by CGP Grey & Brady Haran of Hello Internet podcast.
