### Description
<b>This style will not work correctly on screens that are too small!</b>
I wanted to do something different with this style, and for people with small screens, as I said it won't work correctly.
If you have a question ask them bellow, and don't forget to drop a <b>thumbs up</b> on the style!
If you wish to have a conversation with me or ask questions more in depth, contact me on a Pokemon Showdown server such as <a href="http://origin.psim.us/">Origin</a>.
<b>THIS STYLE WAS FIXED AND SHOULD BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL</b>
