### Description
The Experts Exchange site really annoys me.  If you're not a member, they still give you the answers, but they make you scroll way down to the bottom of the page first.  This script removes *all* that crap and reduces the page to the bare minimum necessary, just the question and the answers.  It's not overly pretty, but I find beauty in minimalism.  What matters to me here is the content.
