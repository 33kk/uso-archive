Its for the Greasemonkey Script (GM), without others scripts which add other information near each thumb in thumbnail:
by Alesa Dam:
<a href="http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/82360"><b>" Flickr Commented On (USO Mirror) " </b></a>

<mark>▶ As of April 22 2015 [after Flickr's radical change]  : BROKEN at this time...</mark>

What it does ?:
Integration more compact around thumb's title/informations , Reduce its "Comment Balloon Icon" to provide a clean and tiny aspect on the page.
 - New Tiny Icons.
 - Icons Positions  more close and on the same line of the thumbs informations (meta). 
 - On Photo Stream Page , Icon is near the "FAV STAR" button of the NAV BAR:

- "Comment Counter" move near the balloon , close but outside it.

This Userstyle seems work with other scripts without problems... i hope!
