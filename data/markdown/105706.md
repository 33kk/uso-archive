### Description
Inspired by Steam's pre-2014 look, this custom style repaints the majority of Steam pages to a dark grey theme.
<br>This is the Compact version that strips the store page down to the bare essentials, removing most of the newly introduced elements such as the curators, the recommendations, the queue, the recently updated, the new on Steam and the endlessly scrolling bottom. It applies to the front page, the game pages, the forums, the workshop, the community hubs and the achievement pages.
