### Description
This style makes the new beta7pre loading bar wide, looking like fission add-on was. It also adds a nice green (windows vista/7 like if you're using one of these two) style to it.

Credits to foxxyn8 for the help!

Updates:
- Changed the color of tab progress bars to green to mach the style.
- Fixed a few issues caused by the release of tab progress bars.
- Changed the opacity of the gray background to make it less visible. 
If you want to completely remove the gray background change "opacity: .4 !important;" with "background-image: none !important;"

- Fixed an issue where you can't select the address in the url-bar when a page is loading.
- The progress bar now starts at the left end of url-bar and do no cover the identity box whatever it's size.
