### Description
Inspired on <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/119263/neudark-stylish">Neudark - stylish</a>
Works with chrome,<strike>the another style (neudark) doesn't work with google chrome properly.</strike>
EDIT: The another style works perfectly I was meaning about another thing. 
You can see what I was meaning with second image.
