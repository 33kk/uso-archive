### Description
Useful if you have many extensions and don't want to be scrolling up and down. Also styles the plugins and theme lists, but I'm still working on that.

See screenshots for effect.

Apparently, it only works for Windows.

OBS1: The style is only for the addons manager.

OBS2: Always trying to be compatible with the latest nightly version of Fx. However, a change can happen any day and break the style, and I'll need time to work out a fix to it.

OBS3: If you're using the Addons Compatiblity Reporter extension, try style 43599.
