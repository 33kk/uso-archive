### Description
just in case you want to style the editor yourself. install the style and mess up your self.<br />
if you want to use this like in the screenshot you have to do small updates in the code. I have to implement them to avoid failure messages within the userstyles.org code checker. remove all lines where you find "REMOVE THIS LINE" in the code.
<br />
to avoid a global style definition the code is active for the domain "css-code-example-for-any-browser.com"
