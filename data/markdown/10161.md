### Description
This style is made specifically for Mac OS X version of Firefox 3.

Actually, not HUD, because the background is not transparent. Leaving the transparent background did see a disturbing effect when selecting the rows. Anyway, it is quite similar and transparency was something really annoying for daily use.
