### Description
Collection of changes:
- Moves all the settings in the top right corner
- Moves the MP3 player in the top right corner
- Doesn't display the annoying red dot and other "useless" information (no share, no footer, no redundant setting, no analysis button, ...)
- Links already read are almost invisible to better see the new ones
- More space on the main page (smaller add button, smaller header, smaller tabs, smaller spaces between columns,...)
- Improvement of the reading widget (more space)
