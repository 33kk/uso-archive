"<i> 'What I tell patients is, if you like coffee, go ahead and drink as much as you want and can,' says Dr. Peter Martin, director of the Institute for Coffee Studies at Vanderbilt University. He's even developed a metric for monitoring your dosage: If you are having trouble sleeping, cut back on your last cup of the day.</i>" <sup><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/11/the-case-for-drinking-as-much-coffee-as-you-like/265693/">*</a></sup>
