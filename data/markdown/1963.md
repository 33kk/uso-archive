### Description
Hopefully this will make reading the eBay forums a little easier on your eyes.  It also gets rid of the right-hand column to give more forum space.

Was made for  the UK eBay site on a 1028x768 screen.  But should work with any other eBay forums too if you add your site to the list of domains in the first few lines. This has been done with with the German, US, Canadian and Aussie forums already.
