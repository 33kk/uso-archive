### Description
I always found the qwebirc theme to be very agressive, and a lot of components didn't fit together. So I decided to pick up forken's black theme, update it and make a charcoal theme out of it! I also changed the font to a monospace one, and made it a little bit bigger. Hope you enjoy!
