### Description
A user style based on Helvetireader by Jon Hicks
[Version 1.1 - Now with coloured 'Other Calendars' and support for https:// hosted calendars.]
[Version 1.2 – Cleaned up for use with Google Gears [Help from Martijn van der Ven].]
[Version 1.3 – Fixed Firefox specific bugs (tasks, labs items,hover states etc)]
[Version 1.4 — Events are now colour coded in the 'Months' section.]
[Version 1.5 — Maintenance. Moving elements back to their original position and filling in the new found blanks.]
[Version 1.6 — Added RSVP colouring and line-throughs. Thanks to Chris Barth for his help.]
[Version 2.0 ALPHA — This version is just a hack to make Helvetical functional in the new (and very much improved) Google Cal UI. Final version to follow within days.]
