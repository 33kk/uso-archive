### Update notes
This one is mainly for myself so I don't lose it, but feel free to try it, you may need adjustments on the navigation buttons depending on name length, I cant seem to fix this so its automatic..

Adjust:

.formPopup .primaryControls input.textCtrl {
    width: 70px;

At the bottom of the code to make fit any name size.
