### Description
I took the style 1019 user style (by user 803), spliced in some code from other sources, and came up with this, for the purpose of a more low-contrast style than the black-on-white of style 1019.  

UPDATE (3/28/2010): I noticed I had forced a font choice, and that it was causing errors on smaller screens; removing those lines seems to have done the trick.

UPDATE (5/8/2010): I may have finally fixed a display bug that involved the unboldfacing of a navigation link while hovering over it.

UPDATE (9/22/2012): Some changes to restore border-radius functioning and to bring in line with required Userstyles.Org change.
