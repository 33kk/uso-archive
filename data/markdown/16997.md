### Description
Center all pages, including pages with single image, and try to maximize the page if possible. You can disable either centering or maximization by commenting or deleting corresponding code lines (read comments).

Comparing to Center all pages style (http://userstyles.org/styles/337), it provides much better compatibility to various sites. It has the effect as Center Images Horizontally and Vertically style (http://userstyles.org/styles/13805) on the image-only pages (borrowed code from that style). Thanks Heisenberg's Cat!

However, I still cannot guarantee this CSS is correctly effective on every page. Some web sites require additional ad hoc tweaks. Tell me if you find any compatibility issue or such web site, and I will try to fix it.
