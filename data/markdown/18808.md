### Description
Protect yourself from cookie grabbers!

This userstyle highlights all the links on the neoboards that are okay to click in light green (ie: links that begin with http://www.neopets.com, http://images.neopets.com, and http://www.petpetpark.com). Links that are from outside sites are highlighted in red. That way you can easily identify potentially dangerous links and prevent getting into a cookie grabber or fake login scam.
