### Description
I like the daily news summary offered by the Daily Beast's Cheat Sheet, but wanted it stripped down as much as possible so it was just the news.  In combination with an ad blocker, this should do the trick, for you and for me.

Last updated 2011-02-26 (considerably further edits to make it even plainer -- removal of numerals, links, photos, excess whitespace).
