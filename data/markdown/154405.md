### Description
This style changes the colours of YouTube's like/dislike bar to green and red respectively.
It also changes the color of the button whether you liked / disliked the video.

Note:
I have tried to make the dislike and like buttons different colours however they do not have identifying classes / ids so I couldn't do it.
