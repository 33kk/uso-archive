### Description
Inspired by the Firefox 4.0 mockups I'm using Strata40 theme by SpewBoy.

Trying to copy the "home tab" feature I used Speed Dial by Josep del Rio (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4810) as my home tab and pinned it to the left of the tabbar using App Tabs by Frank Yan (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/47734)

This style replaces Speed Dial's default favicon with the small home icon of the strata40 theme, making it look more similar to the Firefox 4.0 mockups

If you setup Speed Dial to open the dials in new tabs the  "home tab" will always stay there.
