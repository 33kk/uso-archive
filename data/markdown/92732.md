### Description
Bigger Refresh Button and "Mark as read" for Most Popular Items.

Highlight the Number of Unread Articles in Blue.

I skim the Popular items... Mark them as read... then hit Refresh to get the next 3 Most Popular Items. Rinse Repeat.

The "Mark as read" link is under the refresh button.

(To get to Edit and Remove etc..just disable the style for a moment then re-enable).


Nice and balanced page, clean and easy to read. (Works with Chrome).
