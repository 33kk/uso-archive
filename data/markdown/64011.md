### Description
<a href="http://www.2doapp.com">2Do</a> is an iOs- and Android-based application that syncs with Toodledo. It <span style="text-decoration: line-through">has</span> used to have a lush, slick interface based on natural elements like wood, leather, and cloth. Unfortunately, there isn't such a thing as a 2do web client, and the company doesn't seem to be interested in making one. So I reskinned the existing Toodledo site to evoke how my 2Do app looks. It's not 100% accurate, but it's good enough for me, and maybe good enough for any other 2Do lovers out there. Learn more about this style on <a href="http://www.diegomaranan.com/?p=1991">www.diegomaranan.com/?p=1991</a>. If you see any major bugs, please leave a comment and I'll try to get a fix out. UPDATE (25-01-2015): 2Do looks completely different now and I made a <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/109734/new-2do-styling-for-toodledo">new skin</a>.
