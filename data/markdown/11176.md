### Description
Hey Hotties,

Sick of that ugly bird that replaced the Hot logo in gMail? Well, instead of waiting for IT and DE to make things right why don't you bypass that ugliness with a simple Stylish script.

*Before you load the script*
This script is for a Firefox's Add-on called Stylish. This add-on needs to be install before you load the script. You can install Stylish here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108
