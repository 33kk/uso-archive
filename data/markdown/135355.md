### Description
YouTube has recently changed the way they mark videos as "Watched", by adding a red progress bar under the thumbnails of videos you've seen. While it's not terrible in theory, the current execution seems broken. Sometimes the progress bar doesn't get to 100%, even if you do actually watch the whole video. That in turn may prevent the "Watched" badge from showing up, if it even comes up at all anymore. My code sidesteps that mess by adding a "Watched" badge to any watched video, regardless of how much of it you've seen, and it optionally forces the progress bar to be 100%, or hides the progress bar.

### Update notes
Tested on Firefox and Opera. "Watched" badges should show on the home page, history and subscription pages, channel landing pages, channel video pages, playlist pages, search pages, and recommended video sidebars. If anything is missing or doesn't look/function right, please let me know!

If you use dark YouTube skins such as <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/101409/youtube-dark-grey">Dark Grey</a> or <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/117673/darktube">DarkTube</a>, or otherwise want the "Watched" badge text to be bigger, then check out my <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/135426/fix-youtube-watched-badges-red-bars-dark-mod">Dark Mod</a> style!

Version 1.7 - Nov 24, 2016: Fixes appearance of "watched" badges on search pages.

Version 1.6 - Nov 20, 2016: Time durations in video thumbnails now show up correctly, and watched video thumbnails are clickable again.

Version 1.5 - Nov 19, 2016: Behavior of new red progress bars is configurable now. You can choose to keep default behavior, force 100% width (what my code was doing at first), or hide the red bars altogether.

Version 1.4 - Nov 19, 2016: Incorporating feedback from https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/5dogex/i_got_annoyed_when_youtube_changed_how_the/da6k1lp/. Thank you, qa125. I removed a redundant opacity rule and hid YouTube's remaining native "Watched" badges since they conflict with my code. I also tweaked the opacity of the dimmed thumbnails.

Version 1.3 - Nov 18, 2016: Fixed position of "Watched" badges in thumbnails for videos in recommended sidebars.

Version 1.2 - Nov 18, 2016: "Watched" badges should now show up in playlist thumbnails, as well as channels' landing pages (previously, they were apparently only showing on channels' "Videos" page.)

Version 1.1 - Nov 18, 2016: Reformatted code and added code to dim thumbnails of watched videos.

Version 1.0 - Nov 18, 2016: Initial Release.
