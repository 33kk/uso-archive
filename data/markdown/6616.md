### Description
UPDATED 12/18/08: Updated for newest site style.

Supports most Gawker sites, including Lifehacker, Gizmodo, Valleywag, Gawker, Jezebel, Defamer, Jalopnik, Io9, Deadspin, The Consumerist, and Kotaku.

Removes everything unnecessary on the site, such as the sidebar, the footer, and almost everything in the header (except the trimmed down logo). Leaves intact almost all of the actual content, even on the post pages (ie. does not remove "Read More", Comments, or Tags). Keeps a similar width for content and also centers the slimmed down column.
