### Description
Makes roblox a custom color and animates it.

### Update notes
NOTICE: I have been reading through some of the comments on the style, and I've recently been considering editing the theme again. It has been a long time since last I did CSS, and even if I do decide to get back to working on it, it could take a while for me to get used to. Thank you all for your support, it has made it a much more pleasant experience to create these themes.

IMPORTANT: This theme is being discontinued and will be replaced with style 140676. I will stop updating this theme as soon as style 140676 is finished development. There may be none or a few updates until then.

UPDATE: Customize your colors! Make sure that the colors work along with text color. The default values have a brightness that works with all the colors, so build off of them.
UPDATE: Animates the game-cards when you hover over them. Minor color fixes.

Please check out my newest style, style 140676. Still in testing stages, but 100% functional.

I know that this has taken the navigation bar from style 129504, and I give all credits for the sidebar to user 297063
