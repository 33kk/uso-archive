### Description
Increases the area of the video, info and navigation bar. It increases the video to cover the whole area and shrinks the navigation bar on the right so it fits below the video next to the info box.

The style uses 530 as height so the automatic video quality stays at 480. Change it to 540 and 544 to get a video quality of 720.

The new style will work ok with channels using a custom background image although the elements will not overlap correctly.

The grid view will use the same resized area; at the moment it is not possible to have the default size for the grid view.
