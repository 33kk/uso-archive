### Description
This skin provides a minimal, no-nonsense, easy on the eyes look for Wikipedia.

Updated whenever it breaks; I frequent Wikipedia with the skin installed. Editing is supported. Click on the "customise settings" button for lots of additional customisation options!

### Update notes
If you select either sans or serif for the headings, your browser will use the default sans serif or serif font as defined in your browser setting. I personally recommend Adobe's Source family!
The slab serif option loads the Roboto Slab font from Google Web Fonts.

If you're logged in on Wikipedia, make sure that you're using the Vector skin. This is the default, and it's most likely unchanged (unless you're a pre-2009 user), but if the skin blows up as soon as you log in, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering (replace "en" with your local domain), and select Vector. Save the changes using the button at the bottom.

If you've turned on the themed table of contents, but all you get is an empty rectangle, disable the style, find the table of contents, and make sure it's expanded (click "show" if given the option), then re-enable the style.

There's no guarantee that this skin will work with Wikipedia's beta features (although I try to keep it up to date with those), or any locale-specific features not present on either the English or Dutch version of Wikipedia. It doesn't support right-to-left wikis either.
