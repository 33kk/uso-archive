### Description
I created I style to slim down the tabs which were too high for me since Australis.
It also removes the close buttons on tabs (I use middle click for fast closing tabs). Delete last script to disable it.
Best effect for this style is if you use with "Classic toolbar buttons" add-on with "classic small buttons" enabled.
