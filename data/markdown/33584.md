### Description
Works with ALL archlinux.org pages including Home, Packages, Forums, Wiki, Bugs, AUR, Mailing lists, Planet etc...

Colors can all be easily modified using a text editors global search and replace feature, including the background colors of the images.

MEANT FOR STANDALONE USE, SO DO NOT USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY OTHER ARCH LINUX STYLE.

NOTE:
If you use a light colored gtk theme it will override the background colors of the buttons and scrollbars, there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about that, but you can add this bit of code to the end of the style (just before the last }) to make the text color of the buttons black. I dont want to add it to the style officially because it would change it for all of us dark theme users as well.

input,
button,
select {
color: #000000 !important;
}
