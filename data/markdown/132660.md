### Description
Note that the default workflowy layout is very narrow, so if you're using more than 2 columns, you're probably going to want this style, which lets workflowy expand to the whole width of the browser window: https://userstyles.org/styles/132659/workflowy-total-minimalist

<strong>IMPORTANT: Install the greasemonkey/tampermonkey script <a href="https://blog.workflowy.com/2016/05/19/different-fonts-for-different-workflowy-outlines/#more-1564">here</a> or this won't work.</strong>

Also the 5 and 6 ones aren't very practical at all, but I included them because I figured I might as well.
