### Description
A dark theme for CurseForge, since their latest site redesign is very hard on the eyes. I kept the purple twitch theme, mixed with black instead of white, and increased the font size a bit. Almost everything is fixed, except for the comment editor, which is the same as the original. If anyone can fix that, be my guest!
