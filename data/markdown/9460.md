### Description
This is a real simple style that hides most of the non-book elements on the on-line book site Informit.com.  This script is specifically for safari.informit.com, but you can probably reuse it if your subscription is via O'reilly.

If you want a REALLY minimal experience, I will also post my "Spartan Informit" script as well.

Keep in mind that most normal functionality aside from reading and moving through the book is removed with this script.  So you'll have to turn on and off the script if you need to do advanced functionality.
