### Description
An ocean-inspired tumblr dashboard theme with a seamless repeating image background guaranteed to work on any computer, and a transparent white gradient post container that disappears as you scroll past the left column. If you have any questions or requests, message me <a href="http://www.eatyourheirs.tumblr.com">@eatyourheirs</a> for personalized assistance.


*If you don't want to use the post icons and logo that come with this dash theme, if you disable and re-enable the stylish of your preferred ones after installing my theme, they'll show up instead.

### Update notes
This dashboard theme comes with tumblr post icons of Maggi Hambling or Karen Gunderson wave portrait details, as well as an option between two different tumblr logos.*

11/8 - Changed search bar to be more noticeable.
11/9 - Made a wave-like animation for the post icons <s>(works on Chrome only :-/).</s> Should work on all browsers now! If want the animation removed or don't see it on your browser, contact me please.
11/10 - Made 2 new tumblr logo options.
11/11 - Saw some cool wave portraits by <a href="http://clampart.com/2012/06/water-paintings/">Karen Gunderson</a>, whipped up another set of post icons. They come in their natural greyscale or the edited blue.

1/8 - Code accomidates the new next page buttons now.
