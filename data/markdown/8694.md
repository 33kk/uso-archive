### Description
This hides the Clear and Search buttons from the Downloads List.

Gives you larger area to scroll your downloads, but you lose the ability to search and to clear the list (yes, it's only useful for a small % of the population.)

Browser Versions:
- Works only on Firefox 3

** Not to be used in conjunction with Style 8692 **

Future Releases:
+ I plan to release an update to this style that will Show the Clear and Search toolbar when you hover towards the bottom of the Downloads Window.

Changelog:
- Initial Release
