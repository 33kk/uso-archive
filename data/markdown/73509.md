### Description
(NOTICE: FOR THIS STYLE TO WORK: after you download it, you have to go into stylish and click the edit button for this. there should be a section below the code that'll say something like 'specify'. click the dropdown, click 'urls staring with', and type in 'http://www.tumblr.com' then save thank you ouo
this is really simple, it just replaces the word 'followers' on your tumblr dashboard with 'gays' lol
