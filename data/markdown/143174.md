### Description
Name of the style pretty much explains it all. My theme brings a few enhancements to the new layout such as centered search bar and some missing colors for the true dark mode. <a href='https://puu.sh/w3pLh/cecf8c1b14.png'>Click on this link to see the theme in better quality.</a>

### Update notes
I will not be updating this style for old layout because the old layout is so messy and it is just the matter of time it gets entirely replaced. I will continue updating and improving my style.

To get new layout you need to go to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/new')>this link</a> and accept the new look. After that you <strong>MUST</strong> enable Dark Mode (from the account menu, click on your avatar in the top right corner) otherwise the theme will be messed up (I'm basically changing background colors and few other things, not every single element).

If you have something to add, change or report a bug then please <a href='https://discord.gg/sNywty5')>join my Discord server </a> and we'll discuss it there there.
