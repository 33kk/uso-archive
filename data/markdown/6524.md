### Description
People have asked for a darker version of CyberNations. While the site does not make good use of a CSS stylesheet, I was able to tweak some of the inline styling and create a darker version of this popular game.

The color palette was intentionally kept very limited: regular text is green, while all links are blue. There is no way to get confused. If you do not like the font used, feel free to edit it out of the file. Imho, this console-style font gives the game a more militaristic look.

Also hides some of the ads.

Note: I'm aware the small icons for "info" and "resources" look somewhat screwed -- not my fault.
