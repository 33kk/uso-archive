### Description
This is for people like myself who believe that the new rainbow pride logo ruins the aesthetic of the wiki.

Disregard the bottom text. If you want a more robust way of restoring the logo, use this <a href="https://openuserjs.org/scripts/roberttheavile/SCP_Pride_Logo_Remover">script</a>.

NOTE: Unfortunately there is an error with stylish that causes the regexp to be cut off in code 1 due to how lengthy it is, the only method I know of how to fix it is below.

1. Select the edit button within the installed section for the "SCP Foundation Default Logo"(assuming you installed it).

2. There should be an "applies to" section under the code, replace it with this <a href="https://pastebin.com/ph9G0Mr2">link</a>.

3. Press save. If you did everything correctly it should be functioning.
