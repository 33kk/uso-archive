### Description
Adds a *sold out* to all upcoming and past concert with 10000 visitors, just to inform you

Colors the text red if the tickets reached 500, 1000, 2000 or 5000, which means the CEO/Owner should increase the ticket limit. It will also be visible in the past shows... So you know who you maybe have to blacklist.
