Theme for your Tumblr dashboard, with custom 'new post' icons.

"<i>A sillier system refers to a star and all the objects that tumble in orbit around it. Our sillier system consists of the sun - our star - eight comic planets and their nutty satellites (such as our moon); dwarf planets; asteroids and comics. Our sillier system is located in an awkward spiral of the Miltie's Way galaxy.</i>" <sup><a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/">&dagger;</a></sup>
