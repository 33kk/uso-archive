### Description
A grey monochrome theme for <a href="http://mlpchan.net/">mlpchan.net</a>. This supports both a light and dark version. All of the features work in Chrome, some I was unable to duplicate in Firefox, but the theme still works fine.

### Update notes
This does not contain images, try not deleting it for that reason kthanks.
