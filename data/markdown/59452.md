### Description
There were practically no dark themes for the Drudge Report, so I whipped up a quick style sheet to alleviate that omission. As an added bonus, the link colors now reflect which sites you've already visited.

Given how notoriously simple the site's layout is, I do not envision updating this significantly besides minor tweaks if special Drudge features end up breaking the layout.
