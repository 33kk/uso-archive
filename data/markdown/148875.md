### Description
One of my favorite themes from Stylechan (a side-extension for the 4chan x extension) is "Blackboard Seaweed", and I find myself really, really missing those colors as I go on the niche boards that 8chan offers. This theme uses all the hexes from that theme and throws them on top of 8chan's dark/tomorrow theme... I mean, it looks better on top of those themes, but don't say I didn't recommend it to you. :p

Feel free to take the format I used and repurpose it with your own colors. I don't take any credit for the original hexes, those belong to who ever made the original Stylechan theme.
