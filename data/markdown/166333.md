### Description
Restores the shop icons to the Echo Bazaar navigation list. An option to also include icons in the myself and possessions navigation lists is available.

### Update notes
<strong>Note:</strong> Due to the myself and possessions navigation lists changing contents depending on which qualities/items you have and search results, the icons used could be incorrect. Therefore this is only included as an option.

For possessions, the icon is generally the first item in the category. For myself, I've tried to pick a representative icon from the qualities in the category.

<strong>Update 2019-01-29:</strong> Fixed conversion helper compatibility.
<strong>Update 2019-01-07:</strong> Reduced font-size to 13px (from 14px) to make most shops only need one line again, due to site font change.
<strong>Update 2018-12-10:</strong> Fixed border on "Accomplishment" on the Myself page.
<strong>Update 2018-11-30:</strong> Added coin.png as icon for "Sell my things", courtesy of Cilantro.
