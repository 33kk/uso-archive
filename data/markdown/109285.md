### Description
I wanted a clear skin for Firefox with tabs top and tight, minimal chrome that that could be used on light or dark backgrounds, and that was opaque enough that tab, search, and nav bar text would be too difficult to read. I could not find one so I borrowed from here and there and made my own.

Bottom image shows theme over a light background, and hover over search bar.

### Update notes
Instructions:
Use with a Windows Aero Glass desktop, and set tabs on top in Firefox 29+.

Comments added to ease modification. Tab colors in HSLA and in only one
place, so if you don't like green just choose something else.
