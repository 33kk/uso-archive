### Description
Helps images remain a consistent "size" by re-sizing images to a fixed width; whenever one hovers over an image, that image becomes its original size. It also makes all the images display as a block element, which makes each image take a new line and results in less problems when multiple images are close together.

Default size is set to a max width of 700px, changing this digit is optional.

- Fixed emoticons from being block elements.
