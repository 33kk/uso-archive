### Description
Warning: I was using this on FF28 Windows XP, but on Win7 FF36 it either doesn't work or looks rubbish.

Some minor style changes to Firefox I am experimenting with. It is mainly regarding the header color, an Ubuntu type grey-beige-fawn. Close tab button area larger thus easier to hit. Tabs are slightly larger. The screen-shot is merely a color sample to indicate the correct color.

Experimental style, design in progress.
