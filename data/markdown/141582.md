### Description
...when you can't do it, because they don't give you that possibility in some events, or you want to check something from past halloween/christmas, but it's never on market.<br>
This style will allow you to try something on without graphic program. It works only on home page. When not needed just deactivate it.<br><br>
Remember about order, first links are for bg, skin, eyes and mouth. Hairstyle can be somewhere later, anywhere you want it. When you have icon link like that change icon to web_full
icon link that won't work for preview http://www.eldarya.fr/static/img/player/hair/icon/80d0f326648882ddf47e2b9c22638700.png<br>
web full link, just what you need http://www.eldarya.fr/static/img/player/hair/web_full/80d0f326648882ddf47e2b9c22638700.png

<br><br>
You can edit it manually by adding extra<br>
url("full web full link"),<br>
between two clothes, or just go back to userstyles page of style and paste end of item link, i left 10 slots, it should be enough just for preview.
