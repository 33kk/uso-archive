### Description
Hello! This is a collection of CSS-snippets I've decided to touch-up, as well as some extra little things I added here and there.

This Userstyle adds:


*Voat Logo without the "alpha" symobls

*NSFW and NSFL icons, given that the submissions have "NSFW" or "NSFL" in their titles.

*New reddit thumbnail for when people reference "reddit" or link to reddit.com.

*Full-width Voat for users who don't use AVE.

*Classic Reddit colors for post scores (the (+|-) icons).

*Renames the Discuss and Submit a Link buttons "Share a Link" and "Start a Discussion" respectively.

*Removes  "Discuss" and "Submit a Link" from header.


And more to come in the Future!
