### Description
After a while I finally decided to make this awesome style using almighty-baka's great Chogingua Gurren Lagann background.

It's automatically programmed to appear on all 4chan boards, but can be easily edited by changing the URL operators in the beginning of the code. Send any requests or ideas to spacialvekter@gmail.com
