### Description
This is the thin version of the style 9845 style. It is intended for use with mobile phones or for displaying search results in the sidebar if and when Mozilla fix the bug that prevents keyword searches from loading in the sidebar. It might also be useful for widgets and so forth.

Unlike the full version, this style currently only applies to Google search. It is 200px wide and set to appear on the left side of the screen. It isn't particularly useful for the main browser window on a large screen so if you want something more suitable, I suggest you check out the full version of this style.

If have any requests or bugs to report then please let me know in the feedback. Thanks.
