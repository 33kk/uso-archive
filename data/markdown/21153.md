### Description
Adds a smooth gray background to the heading of "User Styles" in the extensions view, and connects it to the list box. This includes both the Add-ons window and sidebar view (if you have AIOS installed.)
Does not modify the style editor window.

This easily-modified style only affects one specific area, so I'm pretty sure it'll leave all your other styles/theme tweaks alone.

Some of this code is included in my style 21148, although I commented it out to avoid overlapping styles.

The gradient is inspired by the look and feel of style 18500.
