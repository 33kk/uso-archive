### Description
This skin is a fix for IMDb's September 2010 "redesign", inspired by deviantART's slight green/grey tone, as well as an adblock/crapblock. 

FYI: Since this redesign only touched the main Film and Actor's page, nothing more is specifically tweaked with this skin either. All the other sub-pages (Trivia, Forum, etc.) will grab parts of the skin, however. Those aren't looking too good as a result, but at least they are dark as well (and not as glaringly bright white). 

UPDATE on that last FYI: Since September 2010, more and more pages got changed (quite sporadically), and with this skin i tried to keep up. The aforementioned Trivia and Forum pages are now styled as well. There's still a few places left where the old design is in place, but there's still nothing i can do about that. You won't notice it too much though – i hope… :-)
