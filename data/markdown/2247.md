### Description
Those of you who have installed Office 2007 might have notived the new font: Calibri. Personally I liked the font so much that I adobted the Tahoma (unified font) style and made a "Calibri-version". It is set to 10px and I hope this will work ok on the various Google pages and for all your different resolutions. 

Since the font-size is unified some headers that originally were sized up will with this style be same size as normal text.
