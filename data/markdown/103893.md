### Description
This style will make your Firefox tabs stretch across the browser window. Great if you feel the tabs aren't wide enough or your screen's too wide for you if you just browse only 2-3 tabs at once. Works with the old Firefox (before Australis, which is before 29), and Classic Theme Restorer, too~ ;)
