### Description
One more Multi columns userstyles...
This one for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/">Reddit</a>

Better with the Dark mode of Reddit and need login.

This one is better and magical but Reddit redesign using react, so dynamic class names.
And that's difficult to maintain it:
