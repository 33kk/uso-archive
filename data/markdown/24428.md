### Description
For use with the Camifox theme for Firefox 3.6 

Show the "tab close button" on the right side of selected and hovered tabs. Recently camifox tabs changed to have the "favicon" and the close-button combined on the left side of the tab. This annoys me but not as much as other themes do. Rather than switching to Chrome, this is my solution (for the moment)
