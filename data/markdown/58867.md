### Description
On November 14, 2011 Vampirefreaks changed their left navigation to left-aligned instead of centered and also changed the font from the original Arial. A lot of users disliked this. A friend of mine and myself were 2 of those users, so I decided to create a style to change it back to the way it used to be. The screencap shows VF in the blue color-scheme but the style will work with ANY color scheme whatsoever. THIS STYLE WORKS ON EVERY SINGLE VAMPIREFREAKS PAGE (unless your layout has special css coding, of course).
