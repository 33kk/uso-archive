### Description
Unifies several parts of the portal to create a seamless, attractive experience.

### Update notes
This theme is in pretty heavy works. Expect the CSS file to be extremely redundant, self-contradictory and obnoxiously long. Typically beta disclaimers apply: no responsibility will be held for difficult in website navigation, loss of life, suicidal thoughts, headache, loose stools or any other ailment found as a result of using this theme.
