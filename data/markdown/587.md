### Description
==================================
UPDATED FOR DIGG'S NEW LOOK - DECEMBER 19, 2006 - SEE NOTE BELOW!
==================================

Do you want a clean, quick way to read Digg's headlines, without all the arrows, icons, and other interactive stuff cluttering up the screen?

Digg 3.0 - Stripped to the bones is clean and simple -- Digg 3.0 stripped of everything except search form, headlines (fluid display), "submitted by" times, summaries, and prev/next numbers/links. Visited headlines are colored gray. And fluid design allows it to resize to your current window size.

I use this myself. It only takes a second to turn this style off, select one of Digg's sub-categories (like Technology or Linux or Videos) and then turn this style  back on again.

Don't forget to also try my other style: style 588.

Don't forget to also try my other style: style 1083.

Update (July 25, 2006): I darkened the color of the headlines to make them show up better for Linux users.

Update (July 27, 2006): Now hyperlinks turn red when you hover over them, green when you click on them, and gray when you have visited them.

Update (September 24, 2006): Reduced the font size of the news headlines.

Update (October 3, 2006): Gave news headlines a cleaner, easier-to-read font.

Update (October 9, 2006): Added 1-pixel spacing to headlines, to make them easier to read.

Update (October 21, 2006): New screenshot.

Update (December 19, 2006): Updated to work with Digg's new look. I tried and tried to get rid of the left-right scrollbar at the bottom of the screen, but no matter what I did, Digg still required me to scroll back and forth. **I think** the problem may be that Digg currently has overlapping divs in its HTML code. When I put borders around each div, they overlapped each other all over the place. That prevented me from being able to set the width of any div to "100%," and it caused the scrollbar to always appear, no matter how wide the browser window was. I ended up working around the problem by setting the BODY width to only 85% and by not displaying the topical sub-menus. If Digg fixes its HTML, then I will rework this style again.

Update (December 31, 2006): Changed body width to 80%, as described on December 19, to fix Digg's width again after they made another change to it.

Update (January 2, 2007): Changed body width back to 85%, to fix Digg's width again after they made another change to it.

Update (January 30, 2007): Changed a couple different values to fix Digg's width yet again after they made another change to it.
