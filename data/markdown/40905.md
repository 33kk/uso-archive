### Description
This is my first userstyle, so if you find any bug, feel free to comment or send an email to raulzitomuniz@gmail.com

This style was made to remove the ads and, the footer useless bar and make the main panel (the really interesting thing) use the whole window (instead of let a lot of blank space like when you use adblock scripts).


=======================================

Version 0.2

- Removed useless left tabs from contact list
- Removed upper banner from chat list
- Main window uses more space on the top
