### Description
<p>Corrects padding and adds hover styles to the top nav menus on the U.S. Bank Online Banking site (desktop version).</p>
<p>U.S. Bank's default styles require you to click exactly on the nav link text to activate it, but confusingly they display a pointer (hand) cursor over the entire link - even the non-clickable areas.  What's more, there is no visual indication of which link you're hovering over, and the links are padded oddly so that a click doesn't necessarily land where you would expect.</p>
<p>This user style fixes all of those issues.</p>
