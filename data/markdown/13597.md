### Description
As seen on the What.CD forums, select Kuro as your stylesheet and install.

I made this for myself originally, so there may be some customizations that you don't like (such as missing links on your user topbar).  Feel free to edit to your liking.

If anybody wants to merge this with Kuro, feel free to do so and post it to the "Share your custom stylesheets" thread on What.

The CSS is a bit of a mess, but keep in mind I made it originally just for myself, not for the public at large.
