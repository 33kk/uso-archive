### Description
I love developing Web sites using Drupal, but hate the outdated look of the drupal.org website. This style borrows heavily from the proposed drupal.org redesign, and makes the site—including the API reference—a little less painful to use.

Note: I will soon be retiring this style, as the drupal.org redesign is being launched Oct 18, 2010. Hooray!
