### Description
This will remove any background image and force a color of your choice.
 
Use it for selected boards only , see screen shots for how to do that.
 
NOTE:
DO NOT INSTALL this style if you are the admin of your boards!
This style is useful ONLY IF you were not an admin on one or more of your boards (i.e. in your company) , it helps you to (locally) remove that ugly background image forced by your dumb trello admin;   so if you are the admin you do not need this style because you can do it from trello options.
