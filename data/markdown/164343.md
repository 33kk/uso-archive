Notice: The is one tag which I can only modify correctly with JS Injection. If you know another solution, feel free to start a discussion.

                 If you use a solution for JS Injection, this is the JS script:

var sml = document.querySelector('small[style="color: #ddd; padding: 8px; display: block; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;"]');
sml.style.padding = "8px 8px 8px 16px";
