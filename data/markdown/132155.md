### Description
Here you can change the width of the content box and font size. Hmm, Set the width value above 53% can prevent the input area from hiding too many things in my case :3

Some pods may enable chat plugin. In that case, you might prefer to set an absolute value for left panel and content box. For my browser I set 300px for left panel and 650px for content box. 

Also the dark elements are from this kid: https://userstyles.org/styles/126626/diaspora-new-style-dark

### Update notes
/* 140916 */
Now you can also set the box width with alsolute value instead of proportion.
