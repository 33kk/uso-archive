### Description
My personal useit.com mod for enhanced readability. 

Some changes to the color-scheme, but the main improvement is the "deactivation" of the "strong" tag. That reduces the feeling that you read a text in which somebody else has gone crazy with a text-marker, IMHO. 

Apologies to Jakob Nielsen. I am aware of the reasoning behind the highlighting. But this may be a case of taking it *slightly* to far.

The style is very lightweight, hacky, and likely buggy. Feel free to improve on it.
