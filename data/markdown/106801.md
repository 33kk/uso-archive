### Description
Option to make the header non-static again, as well as aesthetic improvements.

### Update notes
<b>January 2016</b> - Fixed toggle for the post button on top bar.

<b>April 2015</b> - Made my best effort to deal with the cluster(you-know-what) that is the newer top bar.

<b>11.10.14</b> - Fixes weirdness when choosing to hide the header's compose button.

<b>Forgot to remove custom logo when screenshotting.</b> The moon does not come with this style; get it from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/73377/moon-tumblr-logo">here</a> if you want it.
