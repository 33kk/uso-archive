### Description
Removes all the ads, blogs, news, videos and other useless crap from AccuWeather to make it a useful site again. Now you can just get the weather!

Tested on both world and US pages, using extended and hourly forecasts as well as many other pages. Everything tested ok and the page elements should look exactly as they normally do (although the elements themselves aren't perfectly in a grid as I would want) and pages display all the normal, useful weather information.

Updates:
June 2nd - Fixed the width and position of bars at the top and pages now display weather alerts
