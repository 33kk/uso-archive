### Description
New tab or new window page.

Idea from user XxXAndrewXxX
style 1761

But linking to a HTTP site is a bad idea.
Cropped, resized and encoded a GIF at ~64,000 characters long.
I didn't see any problems with other sites on Firefox 3 either.  I can't reproduce the Gmail bug either.
I added the ":not" statement for the gmail bug - which I've never experienced.  Thanks maedox, I never knew about a exclude param. 
++Vote for this as default for Firefox
Let me know if Andrew's gets updated and I'll delete mine.
