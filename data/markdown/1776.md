### Description
This is based on scottmark's "Digg v4 - a bit more fluid" style.

Specifics (In addition to scottmark's version):
* Removes the big block ad at the top of a comments page.
* Removes the ad at the top of a Digg search page.
* Removes the double spacing for the posting details at the top of a page.
* Thins the comment bar thickness and reduces the addition padding added.

I added and removed some things.  Works pretty good still.  If there's any problems please let me know and I'll try to fix them.

This goes REALLY well together with Digg ClearComments:
