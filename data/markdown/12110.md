### Description
almost totally based on http://userstyles.org/styles/10416
from his page: 
"Places the Tab bar on top of Firefox's window and makes it transparent for Glasser extension (http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=649449) to apply Window Vista's Aero effect upon it. If you have a menu bar shown; it will be placed below it, I suggest using a menu-bar hider extension such as Hide Menubar to make the effect more pleasant."
i use personal menu https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3895
also used with style "global- my custom tweaks" http://userstyles.org/styles/12111


yes, it's ugly code. it works for me. should be easy enough to change to suit your tastes.

update: to add the ie7/vista blue donut throbber to tabs, check out http://www.xuldev.org/blog/?p=62

update: complete the chrome experience with this extension http://www.krickelkrackel.de/autohide/autohide.htm . set it to always show navbar, taskbar, and tabbar.
