### Description
This is a style to recreate the style of the LiveJournal site that was present during Halloween 2007.

Note that this style will NOT do anything on its own; it requires the 'LJ Skins: Class Adder' script from userscripts.org to work as LJ does not yet allow easy identification of site schemed pages. This script can be found at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/10190 ; please see that link for more information on the script itself.
