### Description
Outlines table rows that are active or hovered over for better readability, as a global style this will be active on all browser content.

### Update notes
The default outline colour is magenta for highest contrast compatibility, considering the wide range of background colours on the web.
The !important tag is missing for a reason, if the content's designer has actually bothered to add these features to their stylesheets we don't want to override those.
