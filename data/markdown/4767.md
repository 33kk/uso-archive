### Description
https://www.google.com/accounts/

version 0.0.4


--[description]

Clean Google login pages of everything but the two blocks for logging in and creating accounts.


--[series]

The "paintless" series is a collection of styles meant to be styled over.  Alone, they clean the target page(s), preparing them for further styling with hopefully the least possible selector specificity.

Writing your style to overlay this one will save you from having to include this code version in yours.  Users can load both, and they'll get my updates without needing you to notice the update.  Write your style correctly, and my updates shouldn't damage your styles.
