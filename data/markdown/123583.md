### Description
Replaces the graphic emoji's that facebook substitutes for ASCII emoji's with plain text characters. I personally get really pissed whenever I try to insert a text emoji and the website decides to hijack it for some ugly little graphic they've picked out. 

**Note** This will not change what other people see when you send a message, just how the default facebook emoji's are displayed for you. I'd probably need to write a greasemonkey script or something to disrupt that process, and I ain't got time for that shit.

Per the font options: 
Monospace is 'traditional' for ASCII because it makes sure everything lines up, but for plain text emoji's, I personally think Arial looks best. Feel free to pick 'Default' though, and it will set to inherit the font from either the facebook default or any other theme you're using.

### Update notes
v0.0.3 - Updated to fix the ascii's floating up into the line above them, and the heart ascii being changed to an image. I don't see the panel for ascii emoji's in the sticker panel anymore, so if any others are broken please let me know!

v0.0.2 - Updated to fix longer ascii's wrapping to a second line.

v0.0.1 - Includes replacements for all emoji's in the Emoticons tab of the stickers fly up on chat. Does not (at least should not, per my limited testing) affect emoji's typed with a smartphone keyboard.
