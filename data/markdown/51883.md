### Description
Puts more focus on your tasks by hiding the sea of "None", "No Date", etc. values in your tasks, reducing the top menu bar and left-side menu bar, and converting the left "View by" and tabs section into a pop-out menu.

This was specifically written for the July 2011 update to the ToodleDo layout and look.  It doesn't currently affect any pages other than the main Tasks page.  Ideas (but no actual CSS) borrowed from style 41218 by user 76728 in particular.
