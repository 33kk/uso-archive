### Description
This is a re-skin I am working on for Dogpile, since I simply do not trust Google anymore.
The US government is really getting their hand up Google's ass & they're just bending over and taking it.
So, I've made the switch. If they want to censor search results, they better look at Google, Yahoo & Bing collectively, and when they do -- HELLO YANDEX! lol

BTW, I do all my CSS in my modded version of ChromeStylist, so sorry if it's not 100% Firefox compatible.
(No I don't use Chrome, I use SRWare Iron)
