### Description
**OUTDATED/DYSFUNCTIONAL**
left in in case someone wanted to mess with it
This is the first time I have uploaded any code for public consumption so I certainly wouldn't get your hopes up. 

This style is focused on de-cluttering, streamlining and darkening the MightyText browser-based application. Mighty text download/info can be found here:

Note: All the changes I made were to "Classic View" so if you use the power view, move along.
