### Description
Other available themes are just not to my liking, too much bright colors, or the contrast is too high.

Anyway, here it is. Hope you'll like it.

( I also use the "painted black - forms" style http://userstyles.org/styles/3865  )


20100901: remove some white background
20100815: fix due to hotmail changes: set background-image to none to some elements

20100703: testing the new feature of userstyles.org, not sure yet if that's a good idea, I can still revert it anyway, default choice are marked(*)
   feel free to suggest me other colors. thanks for trying:)

20100312: updated the login page css: fixed the white background on login name
