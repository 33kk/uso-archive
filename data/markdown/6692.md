### Description
White style for gallery-dump.com. This style makes readability very easy with vista's Calibri font, as well as the white styling.

Features:
- Calibri font (Supports Windows XP and Windows 9x by including "Arial" as
the secondary Font-Family if Calibri is not found.)
- White background
- White tables
- Orange heading text
- Bright / Light overall look, much like a newspaper or magazine
- Slight cleanup by removing the count "Over ##### pictures" in the page Header

Style's Idea:
-This style was suggested to me. Please continue suggesting websites (such as this gallery dump) for me to style, I especially enjoy styling a dark website to white.

About:screenshots:
- Screenshot images have been filtered, and I took the Average color from the photos.

+ Added Bold, Underline, and Orange color to paging buttons (next page, previous page, and see more galleries from this artist) - the click "here" links
+ Added Increased Font Size to the Dates and other such headings on the main page.
+ Both these new features add greater page navigation, and link-finding ease!

1.0.0.1:
+ Added Hyperlink Hover color - Red (WebSafe)
+ Added Hyperlink Visited color - Header-Orange (Web Safe)
