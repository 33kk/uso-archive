### Description
Just a tiny role to override the height:x !important hardcoded on the forum.
As long as it does not affect fixed ratio rectangle vertical avatars, it makes the square ones squish.
This fixes it, allowing vertical rectangle avatars to preserve their ratio, while allowing square ones to stay square. Does not affect the width, so there is no way something breaks on huge avatars.
