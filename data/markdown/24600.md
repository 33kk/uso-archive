### Description
geocaching.com assumes that your browser has a certain width and enforces it in their CSS (to 950 pixels at this time), causing some undesirable horizontal scrolling to see the page in its full width.
This style removes this requirement, the page will fit your browser as any well-behaved HTML page would do.
