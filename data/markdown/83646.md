### Description
A complete Mac-style makeover of Gmail: buttons, sidebar, and all.

<pre>
<b>
&lt;&lt;&lt; Look at the pictures. I have a lot.
</b>
</pre>

Based on the native Mail client found on Macintosh machines, this theme for Gmail creates a familiar yet unique webmail experience.
The first of its kind in quality, design, and functionality. Look no further, your ultimate theme lies here.

<em>IMPORTANT: Remember to change theme to Light Gray (okay, others are fine too but may not look good)</em>

And remember to rate: I'd love to hear your feedback so I can improve my userstyles.
