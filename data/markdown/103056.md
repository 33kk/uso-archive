### Description
This style turns OkCupid into a darkish grey and blue color scheme.  Also removes the ad that shows up when using adblock plus, this was difficult and may remove other things as a result but i haven't noticed anything.

Please leave feedback be it positive/negative or stuff i missed to change.
