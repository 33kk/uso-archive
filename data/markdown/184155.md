### Description
A complete YouTube Music redesign to enhance your experience.
Install the YTSwag extension from the Chrome webstore for Lyrics & PIP integration!

PS: This theme is now included in the YTSwag extension, you can enable it directly in the YouTube Music settings pane -> YTSwag Settings. Note that future updates will still be updated first here, so you can keep the Stylus theme and choose "None" in the YTSwag settings if you want faster updates.
