### Description
Makes the banner + header, look a little nicer. Along with some other edits.

### Update notes
If you want the Night/Day banner, select 'Advanced Style Settings' below, and under enter url.. enter either one of these:

https://www.brick-hill.com/assets/nightBanner.png

(I would add it to the settings, but the site keeps returning an Internal Server error 500)
