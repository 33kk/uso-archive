### Description
Few quick tweaks to the new Eurogamer design to make it a little more bearable. Centred a couple of things, got rid of the omnipresent blinding white background, highlighted the site navigation and hid the highlights bar.

It's an incredibly rushed job, and I can't say I'll keep it updated if anything else changes on the site, but hopefully it'll help a few people out for now.
