### Description
It bothered me that, unlike in the past, the "ONLINE" color didn't change depending on which particular skin you were using at Rooster Teeth.

So, I changed the color for the "ONLINE" span on RT, RvB, and AH. This is really for the people still using the old style.


I can be found on RT as Soul_Tiller.
