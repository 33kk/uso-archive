### Description
This small css file will reduce the amount of quotes within quotes. Everything beyond 2nd generation quotes will be removed/hidden from the thread - thus making it easier to browse the forums.

I´ve also set a max-width for pictures so I won´t get any horizontal scrollbars - you can adjust that width for your monitor.

And I´ve changed the outline color around the forum from blue to orange so I know immediately when this style is turned on.
