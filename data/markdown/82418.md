### Description
This came out of a request from a friend who was having difficulty using the Gmail web client with the Windows High Contrast theme on. Basically, it tries to replace button content with text content which can be seen even with High Contrast enabled. It's a work-in-progress, so please feel free to comment or make requests. The whole idea is to make Gmail a little more accessible.
