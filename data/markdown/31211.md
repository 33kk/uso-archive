### Description
I made a new dark style for the updated website themes. 

It works on every archlinux.org page Ive come across including Home, Packages, Forum, Wiki, Bugs, AUR, Download

I tried to keep it simple as possible. Colors can easily be changed around using your text exitors search/replace function. ;-)

NOTE:
If you use a light colored gtk theme it will override the background colors of the buttons and scrollbars, there doesnt seem to be anything I can do about that, but you can add this bit of code to the end of the style (just before the last }) to make the text color of the buttons black. I dont want to add it to the style officially because it would change it for all of us dark theme users as well.

input,
button,
select {
color: #000000 !important;
}
