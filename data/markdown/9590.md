Notes:
-Using other Styles/Extensions/Themes may interfere with the Statusbar/Findbar/Download-Statusbar margins/settings. If so, try not using other styles that changes margins/settings in the Statusbar/Findbar, and use the default firefox theme. Try keeping the statusbar clean.

-Some extensions may place some icons/buttons on the Statusbar left side, just before the Statusbar text.

@ allen on Aug 14 2008: sorry, i'm using fission so i didn't notice that. Now it's fixed.

@ atitan on Oct 10 2008: as you can in the screenshot, the BG color & text color/size can be changed. Just open the style, scroll to bottom of the page, under CUSTOMIZING, then section 5, 6 & 7 and you'll find what you're looking for. Use the discussion for more help :P

@ nba on Feb 08 2009: I added support fot "EXTENDED STATUSBAR", only works with "classic style" (but you can open the "new style" toolbar if the findbar is closed).
---
@ Zedo Mann on May 03 2009: I never encountered that problem. Maybe you are using some unsupported addons/styles that changes something in the statusbar/findbar.

@ STeV3N on May 07 2009: done.
