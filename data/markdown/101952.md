### Description
Unity 4.5 introduced a new interface for its manual and script API. This new interface allows for a lot less content on the screen.

This style tries to reduce the amount of space used by several elements on screen, for more comfortable browsing.

Compatible with style 101943


The side menu height can't use relative values because those break the javascript based scrollbar. If you want to use the original script based automatic scaling, remove the ._mCS_1[style] block.

### Update notes
28-05-2014 Added setting for the height of the side menu.
