### Description
A recent release of Greenhopper to the Atlassian OnDemand platform has made some parts of the system significantly harder to use, so this small style update makes only two changes:
- Set the issue detail panel to 700px instead of the newly hardcoded 400px in the new UI
- Remove the padding between properties in the issue detail panel
