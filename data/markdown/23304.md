### Description
>>>Special thanks to Narulez for editing my code improve some of the problems it had.<<<
>>>  Also, I'm officially adding Narulez as co-creator. Done a lot for this style!   <<<

***Made for the Chrome, so may not work in other browsers***
***Update: I've been told that it works in Firefox***

I've used DaedalusIcarusHelios's background from his or her "Dark Shiny Blue, Transparency" style series.
Specific changes:
~ Background
~ All text colors
~ Table background colors
~ Images are slightly transparent

This isn't perfect, but I, personally, like it, so I thought others also might.
