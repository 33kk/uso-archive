### Description
Please Read:
I view this custom style sheet as belonging to the group of individuals who frequent the Minnesota Greyhound Rescue Blog and of course use this style sheet. So if you do use this style sheet, please consider yourself a partner in the evolution of this style sheet. If you disagree with any changes I make, if you consider a change to be a step backward, or if you have an alternative to suggest, please let me know.   


2010-03-08: Changed post content background color to #fefcfa from #fcfcfc.  Perhaps it's just my eyes or my monitor rendition, but IMHO I think that #fefcfa produces a richer off-white background.  The former #fcfcfc seems flat by comparison.  

2010-02-18: Slight change that will be barely perceptible to some. Changed div#page and div#content background color from #fafafa to #fcfcfc. Decided that #fcfcfc is a more appropriated contrast balance compared to original bright white of #ffffff. 

2010-02-15: restyled comments presentation to position avatars to the left of the comment.  also indented comment to prevent overlap with avatar. 

2010-02-09: changed div#page and div#content background color from #ffffff to #fafafa to slightly reduce visual contrast with theme's dominant dark color palette.  Reduced text-shadow on blog title and description.

2010-02-08: a little kludge fixing and header cleaning. 
2010-02-07: Added styling to linked images featured in posts. Styled previously overlooked H2.
2010-02-06: Added styles to display blog title and description.  Positioned each above header photo.

General effort to create uniformity of style changes across pages and sections.
Changes to font size, font selection, font weight, sidebar navigation, post styles, image styles.
Changed image caption style to allow for multiple lines of text within caption area beneath image.
Possibly related posts section now displays posts exclusively from the Minnesota Greyhound Rescue Blog.  

User comments and suggestions for changes are always welcome.
