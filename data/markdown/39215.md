### Description
Because wider isn't always better.

Have you ever tried reading text across 1300 or 1700 pixels?  How about those sites that cram everything into the left 800 pixels?

This style creates a maximum 1011 pixel space in the middle of the screen and places the current content inside of it.

Why 1011 pixels?  Because that's the usable space on a 1024x768 monitor with a scrollbar.  If you use the same stylish.sqlite across multiple computers you won't even notice it on a 1024 monitor.  You can adjust this number a couple of pixels either way depending on the width of your scrollbar.  Adjust it so that you don't see the borders on a 1024 monitor.

This style is not intended to be used globally, just where a wide screen looks awkward.  I've included plenty of examples but you will have to add your own domains and url-prefixes.

You may occasionally see something outside of the box.  This usually means that the page you are viewing has styled an element as "position:absolute" and you will have to live with it or edit the page's css.
