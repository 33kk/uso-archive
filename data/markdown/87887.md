### Description
Since twitch removed the rounded corners on the badges. This -should- add the rounded corners back on Staff, Admin, Broadcaster, Moderators, Turbo, Subscription, and IGN (Don't know if they still use it) badges. I forgot what exactly Twitch had before, But I think 2px looks about right.)
