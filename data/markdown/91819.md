### Description
Sometimes you just want to see if someone has posted opinions on a post on Tumblr. Good luck sifting through 10000+ notes of silent likes and reblogs to find the one piece of interesting commentary, though!

Introducing <b>Tumblr Hivemind Killer</b> - a script that, when browsing the notes to a post, only displays people who have reblogged with commentary. This works both on your dashboard and on blogs.
