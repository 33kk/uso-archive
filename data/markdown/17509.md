### Description
The new format for The Mudconnector (TMC) is extremely restrictive. Both vertically and horizontally. This script fixes that by changing the top and bottom nav sections to stay at the top and bottom of the page (rather than being fixed on the screen), removing the very large blank area for the IRE ad (which doesn't show up for linux enthusiasts, or ABP/Noscript users), and expanding the horizontal space to the full size of the screen. Also, the bottom links in the footer were not visible due to clashing colors with the background image. This was addressed by changing the background image to a flat color. 

Secondly, on the discussion pages a lot of junk was moved or removed. One more ad was eliminated (which is also at the bottom of the page), the next/prev discussion links were placed in their own nav bar to the right, and a lot of padding and empty space was eliminated so the actual discussion thread is visible without having to scroll down just to get to it. 

Lastly, a few visual elements were improved to be more readily identifiable, and to make the interface more usable. 

The purpose is to improve functionality over appearance. So, there are some tidbits that could use some visual love... feel free to add to those areas.
