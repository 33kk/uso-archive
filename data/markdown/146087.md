### Description
This is the Adaption of ther mtness viewsource style for the Firefox devtools.
Since the development of firebug ceased and I had to switch to the onboard devtools, I quickly became annoyed by these rediculous candy-colors.
Threfore I had to adapt the mtness styles, again.
This s loosely based on https://userstyles.org/styles/140217/firefox-48-devtools-colours-for-49 but I had to start from scratch, basically.

Be sure to get the mtness viewsource style, too!

There is also a matching colortheme for notepad++ - if you are interested:

Towards Perfection,
mtness.
