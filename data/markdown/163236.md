### Description
Sleek, modern discord skin for the discord client. Meant to fix the overly bright discord dark skin and add a little bit of popping red color.
> Only works if discord is set to Settings/Appearance/Theme is set to "dark" <
> Only works for the discord client with BetterDiscord installed (not Web) <
