### Description
Affects about:blank / about:newtab / chrome://urls / resource://urls / view-source:urls

Works well as a base for your browser and taking care of "white flashes".

This turned out to be much more of a project than I had intended.  All in an effort to take care of the "white flash" syndrome that seems to "affect some pages".

If you are one of those people who has checked 100 times to make sure you colored every last bit of CSS but are still getting a white flash, then I suggest you read the NOTES below.
