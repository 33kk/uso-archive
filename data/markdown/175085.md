### Description
Simple CSS for customizable background and bg opacity. Popular discord styles usually don't work/get abandoned for some reason ??? so I made this one which should be easy to update.
<strong>Custom bg w/URLs:</strong> Upload your img to discord, then use that uploaded bg img URL

Github and bg art credits available <a href="https://github.com/birb-naise/discord-simple-clear">here</a>
