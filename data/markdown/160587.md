### Description
Must have a tag called '.done'.

Useful for applying for jobs and you need to mark items you have already applied for.
*Note - the checkmark is not interactive, it is only an icon to help with sorting.

Works well with my Autohotkey script...to checkmark with a single keyboard shortcut. see below.

Looks good with my other user style "Nicer Inoreader Cleaner"
