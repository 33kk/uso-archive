### Description
See <a href="https://nonyhost.tumblr.com/">this page</a> for info, updates, or requests.

Makes the FR website darker, more compact, more accessible, and fixes annoyances.

- Darkens the entire site. (Compatible with Zoga's theme, see how below)
- Widens the entire site. Many pages have been rearranged to fit the wider theme.
- Increases the size of items where shrunk, without compromising the rest of the page.
- Create a default text color, font, size, or all three on the forums and profile pages.
-Removes unnecessary padding. On most modern monitors: All baldwin recipes, all nests, exalt bonuses on the main page, and the first couple of lines of a dragon's bio should now be visible without scrolling.

Adds a reduction cheat sheet to baldwin and an element cheat sheet to the coli.
