### Description
For Firefox 5+ and up to the latest Fx 14 builds.

Userstyle for latest Fx 15+ builds found here:
style 45809

This style makes the App menu button an Fx Branding Logo icon only when window is maximized with Tabs in Titlebar and minimizes the "window caption controls". This also modifies the appearance of inactive tabs making them more visible on Window OS Themes or Moderately dark Personas Themes and restores the "modern rounded tab styling" that was removed from "Windows OS only" due to Bug 570279, just prior to the releasing of Firefox 4.  This also styles the Tab favicon and Urlbar favicon of New/Blank tabs.

Fx/Beta = Orange Firefox logo icon
Aurora = Aurora brand logo icon
Nightly = Nightly brand logo icon

<b>!Important!</b> After applying this userstyle you may have to toggle the Window state from (Minimize to Maximize) or restart the browser, so the style will appear correctly.

Tested on Firefox 5 and up to the latest Fx 13 builds.
