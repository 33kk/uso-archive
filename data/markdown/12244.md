### Description
Firefox has a feature where you can press Ctrl+1-9 (or Alt+1-9 on some systems) to switch between tabs.  This style adds a small number so you can see at a glance which hotkey corresponds to which tab.

The labels are base64-encoded GIF images, black on transparent.  (I've added white-on-transparent versions, commented out at the bottom, in case they're useful for anyone using dark themes.)  It's been tested in the Phoenity Reborn theme on Linux, and in the default Vista theme.  Positioning can be adjusted at the top of the style.  It also works with the Tree Style Tab extension.  No other themes or extensions have been tested!

Note: Ctrl+9 (or Alt+9) does not select the ninth tab in Firefox, it selects the last (rightmost) tab.  Thus, this style puts the "9" label on the rightmost tab.  It may or may not override another numbered label.
