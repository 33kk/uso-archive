### Description
Just show the article (instructions) on instructables.com. This only applies to pages for instructable items -- instruction pages, which have "instructables.com/id/" in their address.

... Comments are hidden by default, but appear when #DISCUSS is the fragment identifier (at the end of the URI). To generate a link to the comments section to make showing them easy, use this user script (my script): http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/41598 or just comment out the first item under "/* hide other things */" to show them always.

... Step links are hidden by default, which is useful for account holders who specify to show all steps on a single page or users of this user script, which shows all steps on a single page even if you're not logged in (not my script): http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33454

... To always show large images, so you don't have to switch between them with thumbnails, use this user script (my script): http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/41596
