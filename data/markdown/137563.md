### Description
Style for turning Apache Zeppelin Notebooks dark (mostly).
Since it is more work to make Zeppelin have a Dark Mode as one would also need to add user specific settings, I decided to try and add the darkness via css.
This is the result. Some parts are light because there where issues or it was to tricky/timeconsuming.
Please Improve on it.
