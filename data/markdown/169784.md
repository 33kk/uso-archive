### Description
<b>Makes the main video container on youtube wider.</b>
Especially on a 2K monitor the default youtube container is ridiculously narrow, but even on 1080p using this means at least one more column of videos visible.

Turn on "Fade++ compatibility mode" to use with <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/164470https://userstyles.org/styles/169784/edit/fade-for-youtube">Fade++</a>

YT now uses a different system for displaying the videos on (only) the homepage. Due to how it works, manipulating it via CSS only is difficult. I have opted to just disable all extra CSS rules for the home page. If you'd like to see the home page improved, please use ><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/34388-youtube-wide-video-container">this script</a>< instead. Subscriptions page and all others should work as before.

I may or may not keep updating this here. The script version is the superior version. I suggest using it instead.

### Update notes
Update 1: The Fade++ compatibility mode should now work better
Update 2: ...Now that is
Update 3: Removed the Fade++ "missing feature fix". Now the compatibility mode ONLY does compatibility. For assorted fixes of Fade++ see <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/170032/assorted-fade-fixes">this</a>
Update 4: Youtube has marked the fixed width as !important in their CSS, so I made mine !important to combat this
Update 5: Seems previous rules worked on the subscriptions page, but not on Home page. Now using different rules that seem to work for both
Update 6: YT now uses a different system for displaying the videos on (only) the homepage. Due to how it works, manipulating it via CSS only is difficult. I have opted to just disable all extra CSS rules for the home page. If you'd like to see the home page improved, please use ><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/34388-youtube-wide-video-container">this script</a>< instead. Subscriptions page and all others should work as before.
Update 7: Channel pages should now be wide as well. +other small fixes
Update 8: improved the trending page
