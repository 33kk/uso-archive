### Description
This is a theme designed for schoology that changes the background into an artsy-like gif. To point this out, the code layout is inherited from the Schoology: Reloaded (https://userstyles.org/styles/135836/schoology-reloaded). Most noticeable parts of the theme have been changed from that one. Please be warned that your computer will consume battery faster with the website open in this style.
