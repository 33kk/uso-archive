### Description
Makes Blackboard (and a couple of other things like Student One on the Swinburne network) a bit easier on the eyes, for when you're getting ready to start reviewing a subject at 2am of the morning of your exam. Generally. There's still some areas that are still too bright (or harder to read than they should be) that I'll probably never get around to fixing because I'm lazy and my course finishes after this semester.
