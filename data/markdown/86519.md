### Description
Works on Gawker, Jezebel, Jalopnik, Kotaku, io9, Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Deadspin

Fixes a few annoying things about the new layout. Choose yes or no for each.

1.Thumbnail Scrolling: Makes all the images small when scrolling the 'latest' and 'recommended' pages

2.Normal Image Size: Makes story image normal size instead of huge (haven't got this working for vids yet)

3.Hide Annotations: Hides the black pointy things on images

4.Un-grey Comments: Gives unapproved comments the same background and text colour as approved comments 

5.Hide Related Articles: Hides the full width related article links in the stories

If there's a problem with this style let me know as I don't go on most of these sites very often
