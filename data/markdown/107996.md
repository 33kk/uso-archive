### Description
I created this style to improve the visual appeal of Imgur. It also eliminates the annoying sharing sidebar, and it makes the top panel always visible as you scroll down. There's a deep purple color theme, and smooth shadows on many of the buttons. It's not perfect, and I'm only developing for Chrome at the moment. Things in Firefox and Safari may not be 1:1 as Chrome (for example, shadows and smooth transitions). This is just a beta. Feedback is appreciated!
