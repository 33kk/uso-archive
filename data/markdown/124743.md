### Update notes

Thank you for using this theme I have developed over the past few months.  This theme is the successor to Papermint.

The purpose of this theme was to improve the readability of Reddit while maintaining the unique character of each subreddit.  This theme reorganizes Reddit into a column layout, and places an emphasis on one-click convenience and media consumption.

This theme automatically disables the columns when the screen is sized too small for them to be an effective layout.  That width threshold can be easily adjusted immediately below, as can the width of the columns.

This theme utilizes full-screen expandos, enabled by clicking on the link thumbnail.  A visual indiciator is provided in the form of a zoom-in magnifying glass for expandable links.  Once expanded, clicking outside of the link will minimize the expansion, indicated by a zoom-out magnifying glass. 

This theme also incorporates an NSFW visual filter that minimizes viewing accidental spoilers or sensitive material while also providing a convenient and quick method of intentionally viewing the material.  The NSFW visual filter can be removed by deleting the NSFW section found near the bottom of the style sheet.

This theme is specifically designed to be used in conjuction with subreddit styles.  However, due to the nature of subreddit style CSS implementation, some subreddits may display incorrectly.

Due to the nature of columns, links are ordered from top-to-bottom, rather than from left-to-right.

This theme is designed to work with RES, including RES-Nightmode.

Thank you,
Vincent

P.S. - I've included a Paper Mint theme at the very bottom of the 
style sheet that can be enabled for use on the main Reddit pages.
