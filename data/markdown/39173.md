### Description
Fixes the stretched notification icon Test Pilot puts on the nav-bar.

Old description:
Removes the "Feedback" text and adds an icon to the Test Pilot button. Only tested on Windows, fingers crossed for other platforms.

### Update notes
2012.02.26 - Finally got around to looking at this. There isn't a toolbar button for this extension anymore - an icon simply pops up on the navbar for me. The Test Pilot menu has been moved to the Tools menu. The toolbar icon's stretched like crazy for me, so I've modified this style to fix that, but I'm afraid beyond that there's no way to restore the menu to the "button" with only CSS (it's not even a button anymore!). I've commented the old code and left it in the style in case people are running an older version which works and still has the traditional button.

2011.12.03 - The Feedback button doesn't show up for me anymore, even though I have the extension installed. I think this is supposed to be a feature. I'll look into fixing it, but I've had a bunch of stuff break with the latest Firefox update, so may be a while.
