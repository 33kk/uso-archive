### Description
Flickr site navigation menus, You Home Organize Contacts Groups Explore, will be transparent... WOW!

This style improves page visibility, allowing you to see all the web content behind the transparency.
This makes Flickr even more awesome!

* Thanks to user 1386 for the style 10306, upon which I got the idea for this style!


Features:
+ You Home Organize Contacts Groups and Explore will be transparent.
+ Buddy icon menus will be transparent
+ All menus in the Organizr will be translucent too
+ Menus will become more opaque when they are hovered over with the mouse cursor
+ Send-to menus will be transparent (menus like blog this, share, and print)
+ You will be able to see the images and text behind the header menu (see thru) until hovered over

Works on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3

Integrates with the following Styles:
+ Style 11902
+ Style 11179
+ Style 11998

Flickr.com nav menus are also known as candy
Edit the Transparency (-moz-opacity) to your liking.  Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!

Changelog:
1.0.0.5:
+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.

1.0.0.4:
+ Added all of the menus which are found when viewing an image (comments page):
+ Send To Blog menu
+ Send to Set
+ Send to Group
+ Print this Photo menu
+ Share on facebook, digg.... menu

1.0.0.3:
+ Added all of the menus in the Organizer (Organizr).  Now the following menus will be transparent as well:
+ The Edit Photos menu
+ The Permissions menu
+ The Edit Dates menu
+ The Add to Set menu
+ The Location menu

1.0.0.2:
+ Added code to make the person menus transparent too.  These are the menus that popup when you click on the down arrow of a user's avatar logo (or buddy icon).  In the screenshot below, my avatar is the black -=Ben=- logo.

1.0.0.1:
+ Added Transparency to the Search menu dropdown box
