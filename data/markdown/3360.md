### Description
A much cleaner, ad-free version of the fantastic site that is Lifehacker. (updated to version 1.4.4 on 11/12/08 after site changes)

It scales the content, with the window (yay widescreens!). It looks great at 120%, IMHO. If you have issues or suggestions, please leave feedback so I know what is or is not working for you!

Features
* Ads and other distractions (e.g. hatted woman graphic, au flag, etc) removed
* Better horizontal scaling for higher resolutions and widescreen monitors
* Sidebar cleaned up, link to home page added
* Removed "Read More" links below bylines and other marketing cruft

(Called "Clean Lifehacker II" in the spirit of style 984 by user 780, which broke when the site updated in November 2006.)

@user 7095: The ghost tags should be working as of version 1.3.4. If they're not working for you, and your version is up to date, please let me know.
@user 9597: unfortunately, noâ€”lifehacker must have removed from the html the prev/next at the bottom of the page. it is possible to move it from the top to the bottom (modify the style css code), but then it wouldn't be at the top... Maybe you could implore LH staff to restore it? Alternatively, you could prob inject it using a Greasemonkey script if you really wanted.
@user 5217: added per your request! ;)
