### Description
This is a theme I'm making for Facebook. Right now it's pretty generic and doesn't go over everything, but it's the start and base. In the future I will improve it further and further.
Works with all my other Facebook styles that modify the way it looks/works, so you can do all sorts of stuff with it. Have fun! I will update regularly.

PLEASE READ!

Since the code is too long for stylish to handle, I pasted it in paste-it.net at the following link:

http://www.paste-it.net/public/p06a54f/

I will update the date here so you'll get a nudge about updating the style, but you'll have to manually update the style itself.

ALTERNATIVELY, and more efficiently,
you can set the URL of the style in the edit box to be 
http://www.paste-it.net/raw/public/p06a54f/
Which is the best choice right now! It will update regularly when needs.
