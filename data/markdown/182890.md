### Description
Prevents navigation bar from being stuck to the top of browser window. That is, the navigation bar completely disappears when you scroll down the page. The attached screenshot presents that bar halfway hidden, it would disappear completely when scrolled a few more pixels down.

This add-on should be compatible with most other user styles.
