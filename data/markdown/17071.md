### Description
add the adobe air icon after unread threads... still a little buggy... working on it... if used with the addUpdateFlag style you get 2 flags...  and can't get a 100% read on when the strong tag gets applied. it's USUALLY when it's a new post, but i've seen examples of older READ posts showing with that strong tag... no rhyme or reason. what a waste of a good site... :(
