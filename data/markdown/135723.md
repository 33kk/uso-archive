### Description
Requires <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10615-hit-scraper-with-export>HIT Scraper</a>, an amazing script for mTurk.

Made because I wanted an Turkopticon overview. Quite often I found myself hovering over the TO Pay to see the overview and decided it would make a bit more sense (for me) to do this.

Feature requests welcome.

There is a donation page, and you CAN donate, but absolutely not required (it does give me extra incentive though, admittedly). Mostly wanted to play with it.
