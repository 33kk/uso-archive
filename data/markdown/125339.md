### Description
PLEASE DO NOT USE STYLISH.  It was sold to an ad company.  On firefox, I recommend <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylrrr/">stylrrr</a>.  On chrome, I don't know of any good extension, so my recommendation is to enable developer mode and find an old version of stylish to install.

This is a Kingdom of loathing dark theme which is as far as I know the only one which also reverses images.  I created it because I wanted a dark theme, but all of the ones I encountered used the images as normal, which IMO is just ugly.
