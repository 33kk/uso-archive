### Description
Resizes the text boxes in the "Send a text message" modal popup to make things a little more roomy. Allows you to see all five phone numbers at once when texting several people. (I may eventually add a userscript to show contact names instead of just numbers.) Also removes rounded corners on the popup (because the background images used for rounded corners weren't wide enough).
