### Description
This is a custom style I created based on 4chan dark minimal, I added some fancy shadow things and whatnot

This style INCLUDES definitions for 4chan X, 4chan X updater, 4chan filter, so they don't look like absolute shit

This style uses the font HELVETICA NEUE by default, if you don't have that, it uses Arial, if you don't have that, it uses whatever your system default sans-serif font is

YOU HAVE TO CONFIGURE THE AFOREMENTIONED ADDONS YOURSELF AND PUT THEM WHERE YOU WANT THEM

HERE IS A LIST OF PAGES THIS(INTENTIONALLY) DOES NOT STYLE:

Main page (www.4chan.org)
rs.4chan.org
status.4chan.org
twitter.com/4chan
formspring.me/4chan
tiny.4chan.org (NOT THAT THIS ONE MATTERS ANY MORE LOL)

This style does not block any ads, including Buzzfeed--if you want to block ads, take it up with your ad-blocking extension
