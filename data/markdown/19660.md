### Description
This is an experimental (yet working) style.

Designed to hide "featured listings" from search results, it has not been tested much so may occasionally hide other stuff, or not hide featured listings.

All suggestions welcome.

20090722 I think this style might make ebay pages load much slower, any thoughts?
20090903 + removal of some highlighting of listings.
20090903 + .de, .au, .ca
