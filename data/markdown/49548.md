### Description
<b>NOTE: As of 01.01.2013 this style will no longer be supported.</b>
This Generic Tumblr theme is aimed at those who wish to try to alter the way your Tumblr looks. This theme doesn't change everything that could be changed, but should serve as a solid base to build upon.

The code is heavily commented in order to aid in understanding some of the changes. It has been coded to retain most of the original tumblr graphics, but the code and comments should help a great deal if you decide to "make it your own".

Example: The icon bar graphic has been coded to be replaced by the same graphic as is used on tumblr. So the basic framework is in place, but the graphic itself would need to be changed by you.
 
You might also want to add the blue eXtras, designed with this style in mind.http://userstyles.org/styles/49679/tumblr-extras-blue-generic
