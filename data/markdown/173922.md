### Description
People dislike the new twitter theme introduced this July and I've got to agree it doesn't look very good. That said, I made this theme to address some of the issues I personally have with it.

This theme mostly changes the background colours of different elements to make the site look overall less "flat". It also restores the old font, which was Arial (and generic sans-serif if your system didn't have it).

The theme is intended to be used with the "Dim" background. It was also built with the blue colour scheme in mind, it works fine with other colours but there are still some background elements which have a blueish hue so it might look odd, YMMV.
Can technically be used with "Lights out" but some elements look a bit odd, won't work properly on "Default".
I also haven't really made stuff react to mouse-overs because it's a bunch of extra work. It still functions fine, I'll do this later.

(sorry if the preview image looks a bit naff, the 200kb filesize limit here is a bugger)
