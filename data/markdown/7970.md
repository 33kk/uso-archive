### Description
Essentially, this is just a script that I wrote quickly to go with my browser's theme. A couple of guys in the chat decided that they liked it after I ridiculed their own crazy florescent colored backgrounds. Thus, I uploaded it. No more MSN for you people. Now I have a place to link you to.

Changes from the original:
Chat box colors - Slightly darker, to detect people using the old CSS background for invisible text.
Text colors - Orange, Darker orange, Red.
Backgrounds - Black.
Background image url - Property exists, no url specified. Experiment! 

The style is dumbly simple in appearance and even simpler to make... However, I like it and I don't exactly see any other styles available for DS, so I've added it.

As a note:
http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5923
I also recommend this firefox theme. I basically tweaked the colors until I thought they looked good together.
