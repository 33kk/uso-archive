### Description
This style enhances the default roll template used by Roll20. There are many similarities, notably in-line links, but this has broader applicability across games, and is simple enough to allow some customization. This style also makes the template wider without overlapping the "Speaking As" identifier, and enlarges the righthand column if nothing is in the left hand column, allowing the user to take more advantage of space when labels aren't needed.
