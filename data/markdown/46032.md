### Description
I really like the "Dark Shiny Blue" themes on this site for various sites (in particular the Google one), but noticed there wasn't one for StumbleUpon. So, I went ahead and took the existing Facebook one (http://userstyles.org/styles/11922) and turned it into a StumbleUpon one. It is very simple and is provided as is, but now there's a Dark Shiny Blue one for Stumble. Yay!
