### Description
Minor layout and colour scheme tweaks to improve readability, post separation etc (at least for me :-) ). Based on style 1382 from user 1194.

- The page is centred
- There is a grey background (the post background is still white)
- Posts have an orange top border and a background-colour gap at the bottom for better separation (Based on Gez' suggestion)
- User profiles have a grey background
- User profiles have equal padding all around (no extra padding at the top)
- The header is 50px smaller (the logo is cropped a little at the top and bottom, but I like the reduced space usage)
- The forum control links ("User CP", "New Posts", etc.) have a light grey line above and below them and have even padding above and below
- Headings (e.g. for different categories in the forum listings) are larger and black instead of grey
- The edit box for replying to a thread has a white background
- Posts in the post review when replying to a thread are separated with an orange top border and grey bottom border
- Links are dark orange, changing to bright orange (like the header) when hovered over
- Posts which are too wide are displayed in full, but not centred (no scroll bars any more)
- Minor fix: popup menu links don't disappear when hovered over
- Minor updates: the header is another 25px smaller, the background image is no longer used (done with CSS instead), and the orange has been set to the value from the image (it was a bit yellow before)
