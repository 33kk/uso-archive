### Description
Create a cleaner Facebook header appearance by replacing the default Social Fixer icon and removing the profile photo.

This userstyle requires Social Fixer, which can be installed here: http://www.socialfixer.com
This userstyle also makes use of your Facebook Numerical ID, which you can find here: http://www.findmyfacebookid.com

In order for this userstyle to properly work, you must replace 000000000 with your numerical ID; otherwise, it will not remove your profile photo (unless, of course, you happen to be User #000000000).

NOTE:  I have only tested this in Firefox 17.0.1 and Firefox 26.0 on OS X 10.8.2-10.9.1 and Windows 7.  Your experience may vary.
