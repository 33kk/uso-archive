### Description
How to replace the original thumbnails with your own images on about:newtab <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5VjCpwQ.png">here is one example</a>

This userstyle is supposed to be used together with my style <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/70561/glassfox-choose-your-personal-newtab">GlassFox - choose your personal NewTab</a>
To simplify it, you can handle all your thumbnails in a separate style. That's the purpose of this userstyle.
Benefits doing that is: 
1. easier to manage, 
2. protect your thumbnails when your about:newtab-style is updated in the future (otherwise they would have been wiped out ...),  
3. your thumbnails can be used together with the original about:newtab page, or an another style (independent my style) if you like.
