### Description
Removes the ad/quote just to the right of the "Compose" button. Also removes the seldom used "Search, Add, or Invite" text box.

I have been trying to see if I could find some way to kill these two birds with one magical-CSS-stone, but alas I couldn't. Its a pity you can't nest :not() selectors inside of each other, as that is the only way I could think of to get some OR-logic going on.

I am using the Google Redesigned extension in screen-shots. http://www.globexdesigns.com/gr/

This edit
