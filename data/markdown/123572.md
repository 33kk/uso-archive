### Description
----- IMPORTANT -----

- By simply installing this userstyle you won't get the results I show in the pictures.

- You will need to install the CTR Addon to pull it off: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/

- You will have to follow the steps showcased in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AryrRMt1FD0.

Userstyle aimed to make the browsing experience as less possible about the interface and as much as possible about the content with a compact firefox look.

- Address bar is retracted to a button (the far left button with a Microsoft-ish Firefox logo) and will expand once the address bar is on focus by either clicking on the button or opening a New Tab.

- Reload and Stop button are hidden behind the adress bar button. Hovering over the adress bar will uncover these buttons.
