### Description
Hides the buttons from the Add-on Compatibility Reporter and Add-on Collector extensions so they don't crowd out the description.

They're rarely used anyway, still accessible from the add-on details pages, and it's easy to temporarily turn Stylish off for batch operations.

(It also removes them from places where they're useless, like the Stylish and Greasemonkey tabs)
