### Description
Made this for myself because I like motion behind my code when I'm working, Thought some other people might enjoy. Makes only the Radio channel on web have a full screen album in the background with a slow 2 min pan going back and forth. Image quality is pretty bad since I had to increase the small images that Spotify originally used. Has some quirks like not having other options on Radio page like "recently listened" and " Recommend" not being there anymore. But it works for me. Have fun.
