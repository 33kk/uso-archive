### Description
Inverts the Firefox UI, but restores images; adds small glow and drop shadows to hovered buttons/tabs. Does NOT affect the content area. This is for use with Firefox without a 'theme' or 'complete theme' (see additional info.)

### Update notes
If you still want to apply a theme, this will likely conflict with night mode themes, because it relies on inversion filters. Otherwise it is largely unintrusive, and compact enough to customize to your liking. It currently contains 10 rules, one style applied to each, and only two '!important' overrides.

If this style conflicts with your extensions, theme, or other styles, please let me know - include a screenshot or description, a list of the addons that might be relevant, and your platform.

'Style settings' (install options) added!

Works well with:
<ul>
<li> Hide Caption Titlebar Plus </li>
<li> Tab Tweaks </li>
<li> Vertical Toolbar (pictured) </li>
<li> Status-4-Evar </li>
</ul>

If you are using Linux, GTK themes may affect the default style. If you are using a dark theme like xfce-dusk, try disabling inversion. Alternatively, specify your theme in your Firefox launcher or terminal invocation as per https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/185115 - this is extremely useful and solves a lot of theme-related bugs/conflicts! It may take some experimentation to find what's best for you, but in general you want either a dark environment theme or inversion from this stylesheet.
