### Description
A fixed width (80em) style for the Penny-Arcade Forums that uses the default background colors, but adds borders around quotes, spoilers, and alters the color of the spoiler background.  It also fiddles around with a lot of the margins and padding around various elements to tighten them up a little and remove extraneous white space.
