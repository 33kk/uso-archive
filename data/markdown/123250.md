### Description
<strong>I am officially discontinuing all my TweetDeck themes, so they may be outdated, but feel free to fork them (they now are into the public domain)!</strong>

This style needs to be used with the light theme of TweetDeck, otherwise it will be ugly !

This style can be considered as a legacy of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/115601/light-tweetdeck-3-aqua-previously-2-2-aqua">this one</a> with new font and colors.
