### Description
Dark themed Craigslist with hint of steel blue...Simple Hover Effects...Uses -moz-linear-gradient so FF 3.6+ needed, although I did leave comments to uncomment the gradient and left code to use a simple background for those not using FF 3.6+...

9/8/10 --  Set font color to off-white in description area. Fixed added right column to match rest of front page. 

Derived from http://userstyles.org/styles/8786 as I thought this is a good style...I did add quite a bit more to it and obviously changed the color scheme...

Before/After pics are set to this style...
