### Description
Finally I am here with v2.0. I am very pleased to launch this. Thank you for so many downloads. :)

WATS NEXT? GOOGLE WIDESCREEN WITH WINDOWS 7 FONT :) KEEP CHECKING....

This will make your Google Search widescreened and with famous Windows Vista Font i.e. Calibri.

I have put Calibri Font as 11pt. Anyone who wants to increase the size can edit the css and can change the size where this line comes

font-size: 11pt !important

Thanks. Enjoy :)
