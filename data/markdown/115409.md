### Description
A muted pink, orange, gold, brown, and blue theme for Kintsugi.

Version 1- Style may not actually be complete, but I think it's good enough for the time being.

This layout requires the current (6/19/2015) alternative colors (Brown and Gold) layout on Kintsugi.

This style has only been tested in Firefox. 
Chrome has issues that I don't appear to be able to fix with the Rich Text Editor. The regular BBC editor seems to be all right, though.
