### Description
This style, compared to my other style (style 1232), is much simpler and elegant.

It locks the top menu to the top, thus making it accessible without having to scroll all the way back to the top, and the paging section is locked right below it, making it more accessible, as well.
In addition, this will also removes all ads on the site and any story that you "bury".

Lastly, if something isn't working for you with this style, let me know and I'll be sure to fix it.

*** IMPORTANT: This style works perfectly with my "Digg.com Mirror" script (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8262) ***
