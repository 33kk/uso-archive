### Description
<strong>I am officially discontinuing all my TweetDeck themes, so they may be outdated, but feel free to fork them (they now are into the public domain)!</strong>

This style needs to be used with the light theme of TweetDeck, otherwise it will be ugly !

As you can see this style is a little bit light with round corners, transparency effects... The best way to describe it is that you discover it by yourself.

<a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/106489/light-tweetdeck-classic-aqua">Here</a> you'll find the same style but without the transparency effect at the top of the columns.
