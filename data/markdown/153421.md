### Description
A dark theme for the 2017 (december) version of Gmail

### Update notes
You can select you preferred custom colors.
Only two custom colors are allowed for now, and they are a dark color and an accent color. Bear in mind that they will go on the dark background you see in the screenshot, so it is up to you to pick a color that suits it nicely.
