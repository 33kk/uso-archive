### Description
NOTICE - 12/25/2019
A lot of Asana's new features use CSS tags labeled "Placeholder" currently; as a result, I expect Asana to break my theme rapidly for a brief bit of time. In the mean time, I will be working on re-creating this theme from scratch to remove the numerous no longer used CSS tags, give the theme a smooth consistent feel again, and fix some issues that are the result of Asana suddenly doing a bunch of rapid changes. I also plan to later bring the option for user color settings with the re-created version, however, the custom color options will be made available after the re-creation is complete

Next Re-creation Theme update should be about mid-February.
