### Description
!!! This doesn't work any more because all Gawker sites have changed to the new format.

Based on style 48250 by moi, this style removes most of the content from Gawker blogs and restyles it into what I hope is a newspapery theme. 
* I've also added some adblocking but I might have missed some ads. 
* The layout is centered with the main content at 500px.
* Paragraph font has been changed to Georgia but the font stack is a bit crap so it will use Times if you don't have Georgia, and Times is quite ugly.
* I have removed all the metadata from posts (date, author, views etc.) and hidden the tags which overlay images such as #hivefive hidden until you hover
* The top bar (Lifehacker, Windows, Mac, Linux --- Login, Search) is also hidden until hover.
* All the hover stuff will only work in FF4 and this has only been tested in Linux.
* Haven't tested all Gawker blogs either: only Lifehacker, Gakwer and Gizmodo, but it should work okay.
