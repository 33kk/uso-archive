### Description
Edit of { https://userstyles.org/styles/106989/the-new-old-twitter-5-11-2014 }, removes who to follow, trends, and the footer while placing the dashboard tweetbox below the miniprofile. Still needs some fine tuning as well.



Known issues: 
Follower Requests appear behind the tweetbox
The icons aren't aligned correctly in the tweetbox
Mention me on twitter (@binksunosake) if you have any suggestions.
