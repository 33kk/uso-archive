### Description
change the tumblr logo to tumblah.

### Update notes
*UPDATE* 8/27/17

Fixed a thing. Now the style also works on those tumblr themes with the logo and search bar.

Added a LGBT+ Pride version of the logo. To install, click on Advanced Style Settings, change from Normal to Pride, and click on update style (if instead of the <i>update style</i> button you see the <i>style updated</i> one, just refresh the page)

Enjoy and Be Proud! :)


- Credit to <a href="http://codeman38.tumblr.com/post/162380885458/"><strong>codeman38</strong></a> on tumblr for the code for disabling the logo animation (which I don't know if it makes a difference with these kind of scripts, but it doesn't hurt to try).

*UPDATE* 3/04/2017

<i>*shakes fists angrily at Tumblr*</i>
Fixed so the new logo won't show.


*UPDATE* 5/04/2015

I leave Tumblr for a couple of days, and when I come back they've done unnecessary changes again. Fixed the button so it actually shows.


*UPDATE* 11/02/2014

Tumblr wtf are you doing.


*UPDATE* 1/4/2014

changed the width and height of the area designated to the logo,
so that the little dot at the end wouldn't disappear.
also, the image is now as big as it originally was :)


*UPDATE* 12/12/12 (heh :)!)

remember when the logo was unclickable? well, i fixed it! i had to make it a bit smaller though, because
apparently tumblr modified its code, and it made part of the image not visible. so... that's my fix.

i hope you don't hate it too much :)
