### Description
Frustrated with the inability of the default Strata theme to integrate well into Windows Vista/7, I decided, having taken inspiration from Daum Blue, Google Chrome and IE8, to make my own! Here is the fruit of my labours. First Wave works with Windows 7, Vista and XP, using the native icons.

Change log:
29/07/2009 - fixed issue with verified domains not showing up in the address bar.
29/07/2009 - changed menu items' hover to be less squashed.

Suggestions? Please leave feedback (especially if you would like a compact version, which I'm thinking of doing.)
