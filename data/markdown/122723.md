### Description
This is a theme for Pretend You're Xyzzy (http://pretendyoure.xyz/) that moves elements around and changes the appearance a little. Your hand is changed into a spread-out form like in the Blizzard game Hearthstone (thus the name), Chat and the Scoreboard are moved to the sides of the screen and shrunk, and all cards gain a drop shadow.
