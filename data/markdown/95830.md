### Description
inspired by 'crayon' MAL style

crayon originally by sunnysummerday check it out, pure awesome'ness (^~^ )


this was quickly put together by me, to go with 'crayon' style for my own personal use... but I decided I'd upload it as long as the original author has no problems with it being up!

let me know if you have any recomendations for this style..

** Highly recommended you use 'crayon' MAL style along side with this for best visual experience. ;-)

13.12.8
Updated, added 'crayon' background & changed some of the font colors

13.12.10
Various updates on font colors, backgrounds, sizes, font size, etc mostly made it more slim and minimal more to come!
