### Description
"Faviconize" selected* bookmarks on your toolbar. 
Works fine with style 7706, style 5546 (although using it with this would be redundant), and probably other similar styles as well.

Replaces a few favicons with data URI images.

I intend to use this as a template, and anyone should personalize it as much as they want.
In fact, I encourage all you Stylish users to take this and run with it. ;-) 
Customize your Bookmarks Toolbar with your own icons: put it on userstyles.org as a "favicon theme."
