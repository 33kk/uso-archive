### Description
Work in progress to remove all the cruft (extra bevels, silly semicolons) and to make Escapist into a better magazine for the sake of previous magazine-like layout: change colors to more reasonable and grown up scheme, remove the uppercase headers and so on.

Any creative ideas about improvements are welcome.
