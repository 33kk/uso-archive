### Description
Simple scrollbars defined entirely with CSS (no images). This example is a basic/flat 2-color scheme in blue. Scroll buttons are placed together in the bottom right corner. Colors, widths, and heights are easy to change to your liking. Works fine in Fx25 -- don't know about earlier releases.
