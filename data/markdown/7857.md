### Description
[The style does not work well since GMail handle themes]

This is a skin for GMail 2.
It is a minimalist skin with a monospace typeface.
It is almost finished and should already be fully usable.
I strongly suggest using the following styles with it:
style 4112
style 4724

You may also enjoy other minimalist styles I made (and that work very well with this one):
style 7871
style 7876
style 7952
style 7954
