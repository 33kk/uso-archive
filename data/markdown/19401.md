### Description
Note: This is only for OS X users. If you're using Windows or Linux you should use this style: style 20088.

Tweaks the Vfox3 theme to look more like Safari 4. Before installing this style you need to move the stop and reload buttons to the
right of the URL bar, and put the reload button to the right of the stop button. Here's what it changes:

General tweaks:

Makes the status bar shorter
Merges the stop and reload buttons into a Safari-style stop/reload/throbber button in the URL bar
Puts the close button on the left side of tabs
Only shows the close button when there are multiple tabs open and one is hovered over
Hides favicons on tabs
Shows throbber on the right side of non-selected tabs when pages are loading
Removes the tab list button from the tab bar
Removes the go button from the URL and search bars
Removes the bookmark star and drop-down marker from the URL bar
Prevents the identity box from expanding
Replaces the search engine icon with the Safari magnifying glass
Fixes the appearance of the Fission loading bar if Fission is installed
Removes the focus ring around links, adds a blue glow around everything else
Applies a semi-transparent theme to the tab previews when enabled in Firefox 3.6

Mac-specific tweaks:

Lightens the main window when it's not in focus
Prevents status bar icons from overlapping with the resize handle
Reverts the scrollbars, drop-down lists, menus and buttons back to the native look.

Known bugs:

- In the "show all tabs" section of the tab previews in Firefox 3.6, an overlay is shown over the tab that is currently hovered over. When you hover over the close button for that tab, the overlay disappears. The built-in overlay doesn't have this problem, but the Vfox3 theme somehow disables it and I haven't figured out how to re-enable it. It seems like it's all done with JavaScript, though, and if that's the case there's nothing I can do until the theme's author fixes the bug.

Still to do:

Improve the stop/reload/throbber integration
