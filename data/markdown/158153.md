### Description
The original Docs dark UI from 2015 is now slightly broken. I am working hard to fix the code. Most of the issues are solved. Some remain. An overhaul of the menu  will also come soon.


EDIT: I've had to update a majority of the code AGAIN due to yet another css update to Google Docs. Everything should look normal now.
