### Description
This removes anything from anywhere on Facebook that I don't like! Complete list of functionality below:

* Removes Advertisements
* Removes New Stuff and Next Steps
* Removes Non-Standard Applications from Profile Pages - thanks to aliumalik for the initial idea (see New Facebook Application Remover for the original; I've modified it so group pages still work)
* Removes Application Stories from the Minifeed
* Removes Application Icons and Show More Profile Boxes Links 
* Removes Attach Items (on new wall post) and Attach a Gift
* Expands all Remaining Application Boxes

It's heavily commented to allow you to customise it to your needs. Feedback is welcome.
