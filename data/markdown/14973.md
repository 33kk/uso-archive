### Description
This is an Zoho mail scheme.

Full version with nice clouds background in blue style.
Works at 1600*1050 full screen, beyond this it will tile it self.

Note:
It is to big to be posted here on the site, sorry about that. So just download the code, open the Stylish windows and created( press "Write") an new style. Copy the code in the new windows, give it an name( Zoho Mail - Cloud's scheme - 1.2) and save it. That's it.

The one that is saved here( press the button below) is an Blue color scheme( that's nice to, just no background picture)

Suggestions are always welcome.
