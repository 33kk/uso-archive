### Description
Makes it easy to read on web pages especially plain HTML docs. Can be used on any site but it may jangle up the layout a bit.

FEATURES:

 * adds a black spacer on either side of the body
 * sets font to 'verdana'
 * increases font size & line spacing

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

 * inspired heavily by the "toggle reading mode bookmarklet" here:
     http://www.xml-blog.com/pages/toggle-reading-mode-bookmarklet
 * chanced on the idea in the css file of a Gutenberg HTML

NOTE: 

The style originally only cleaned up bartleby.com. The code still retains a part specific to bartleby.com for those few who'd installed this style earlier.

LAST UPDATE: Modified the selector for the footer on bartleby.com
