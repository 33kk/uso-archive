### Description
This is a stylesheet for the Guardian - UK newspaper ( http://www.guardian.co.uk ), changing the background from glaring bright white to soothing, cool black and adding a silly little phrase to each of the headlines for no reason at all. I am igor at http://techlorebyigor.blogspot.com and I code dark styles for several web sites. Wherever there is white, let us replace that with black. Note: I do not interfere with advertising. My focus here is on adjusting the brightness, nothing else.
