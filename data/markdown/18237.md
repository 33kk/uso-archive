### Description
Modified style from style 13470 by user 16613. Dark theme, with various shades of gray, goes easy on the eyes. Background image is Awesome Face. Just changed some colors and background image. Credit is due to Bededog, the_foreign_guy and jakeboundville for their work with the original themes.

Works fine on 1200x800 resolution. Not so much if you go higher.
