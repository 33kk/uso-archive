### Description
Makes the Google search results better readable. Font definitions have been taken from style 2407 (except for the chosen font itself - this one has been tested on Linux and Windows) - but you may need to adjust the width to 75% if you did not block the ads with Adblock Plus.

I also recommend style 17712 in conjunction with this one, so you should have almost no scrolling anymore :)
