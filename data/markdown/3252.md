### Description
This style is based on the popular Grey Lady style ( http://userstyles.org/styles/1365 ), but has a darker color scheme.  This effect was achieved by inverting most of the colors in the original Grey Lady style.

*update1*: I made the background color of images white so transparency doesn't look weird.
*update2* Based on DonBex's helpful suggestion, I changed the colors and the pages should be easier on the eyes now. 
*update3* I updated the style to use the latest Grey Lady II, due to a wikipedia update that broke the old style. I used a new method to generate the colors which looks better. Suggestions are welcome.
