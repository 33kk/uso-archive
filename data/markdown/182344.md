<blockquote>
<b>PoWH3D</b> is a fiction-made-real blockchain enforced simulation of self-removal from pareto optimality; an economic concept in which there is no longer a way for an allocation of resources to improve without harming a participant of the model. In this case the harm is intentionally self-imposed due to a lack of patience against other opponents, or as an entry fee to start playing the game.
