### Description
<b>Firefox UI styles are for Firefox 28 and below.</b>

It mimics the look of the close tab button.  You can customize the color of the "x" and background color.  Read the code, it has comments.  

It's flawed because I can't get the x to be vertically centered, and controlling the height without clipping is problematic, so it looks a little awkward (rectangular).

I have no idea how this will perform on non-English localizations of Firefox.
