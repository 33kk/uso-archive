### Description
Darker Style for YouTube since Big update (let's just say "enhanced build-in dark theme with animations n' all").
You can change the background by adding a url or uploading an image.
<i>(Choosing the same background for both header and body, makes it feels indistinguishable)</i>
<p>Icons are bluish(or chosen color) as in the screenshot preview, only if you sign-in on your account there.</p>
