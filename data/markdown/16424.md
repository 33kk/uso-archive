### Description
This script hides Google's top bar (right side only). You can toggle it like a tooltip by mousing over the small square in the top left of the page.

It can be used alone, or in conjunction with style 16423.
 
 
For maximum space saving in Google Calendar, use this script with style 16423 and style 16422 together.
 
 
NOTE - This style was based in part on "Toggle button for the GoogleBar" by senseBOP.
