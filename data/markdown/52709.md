### Description
Part of my Firefox CandyBar theme
You have to install Firefox CandyBar http://userstyles.org/styles/52708/firefox-candybar first to make this style work.

Add some fancy candybar to your favorite site! You can use it as just an eye-candy thingy or as an indicator that you're logged-in that site or any other crazy thing :)
