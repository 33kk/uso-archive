### Description
Created this theme as a request but still had to share it with the world. Especially for those of you who appreciate Zoroark. The amazing image was provided by All0412, check out the rest of his art @ https://all0412.deviantart.com/

*Added some tweaks from Pedro J. Miranda's theme as I really like the effects he added to the Default Pok√©mon Showdown*

### Update notes
