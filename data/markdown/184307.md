### Description
Since we all know most development happens overnight (don't lie to yourself, it does) sometimes burning your eyes out just isn't on the agenda, so I've just reskinned most of the documentation into a discord-dark-like theme, for those extra "why on earth isn't this working?!" days. <i>Don't forget, .join() only takes strings</i>
