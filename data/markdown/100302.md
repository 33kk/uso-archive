### Description
<strike>This user-style turns the left navigation menus (‘Shortcuts’, ‘Explore’, ‘Favorites’, ‘Friends’, ‘Groups’, ‘Apps’, ‘Interests’, ‘Pages’, etc.) into drop-down boxes. Only the titles are displayed and the contents unfold on hover. With settings, you can choose to keep one or some unfolded all the time.</strike>

<strong>The new Facebook has now a different navigation, this userstyle becoming obsolete. Try out <a href="/styles/188625/">my new “Choose your menu” style for the new Facebook design</a> for a similar customised menu.</strong>
