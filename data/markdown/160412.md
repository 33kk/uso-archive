### Description
If you use Google News but hate their recent changes that lack personalization, this style may help at least a little.

### Update notes
I can't do much about the lack of customization, but at least I can help it be presented in a more compact format.  Those unfamiliar with what Google has done or why I created this style should read https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/d/msgid/news/286fb10c-5095-4c22-bb15-62b27df199f9%40googleproductforums.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer.
