### Description
A more system native theme for Firefox 29 and above, similar to the discontinued add-on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gtk-native/">GTK+ Native</a>, and somewhat like style 126018. Say goodbye to Australis, and welcome back to tabs on the bottom, superior OS integration with natively themed toolbars, and system native icons. Just like the good old days of Firefox 3.6. Linux GTK+ Native fully supports lightweight themes/Personas, too, so if you like those, no problem.

Suggestions? Feedback? Comments? Please let me know! This is a work in progress, and I will do my best to respond to you. As this is a Linux theme, there are no promises of what it will look like on Windows or macOS/OS X.

<b>Settings</b>
There are some overrides and workarounds in the settings in case something looks wrong with your particular theme. The default values should be good enough for most people.

### Update notes
<b>Suggestions</b>
<ul><li>For even fuller system integration, I suggest looking at the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/status-4-evar/">Status-4-Evar</a> extension, which brings back the old status bar.</li>
<li>If you want to disable the tab animations, go to <a href="about:config">about:config</a> and set <b>browser.tabs.animate</b> to <b>false</b>.</li>
<li>It actually may not look as horrible on Windows as one might expect. However, you'll have to disable system native icons. If you keep the system titlebar hidden, you'll also have to adjust the right hand padding of the navigation toolbar, which is at the bottom of the style settings.</li></ul>
