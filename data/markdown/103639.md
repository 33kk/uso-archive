### Description
A theme for <a href="http://space.galaxybuster.net/go.php">Space Email</a> based off of <a href="http://scoutshonour.com/digital/">Digital: A Love Story</a>, a <b>(free!!)</b> indie game that you should totally play. Space Email always reminded me of Digital and I got a few emails saying the same (and people reproducing emails from inside the game which is adorable), so it seemed like a logical progression.

It only affects the main Space Email page, none of the others on the site (such as the splash page or FAQ) - this is intentional, trying to skin them was buggy and you don't visit them often anyway. Please see the info section below for additional quirks.
