### Description
This style changes nearly all the default individual line-heights to be inherited (set relatively as 1.12*[current font size] in the body). This way you can still use that property, i.e. without <code>*{line-height:inherit !important}</code>. A few other modifications for a more dense (but readable) layout are applied. This leaves any coloring preferences up to you.
