### Description
Firefox user styles for plain text, using a couple of colors from the Solarized palette.

The styles are included on ".txt," ".md," and related URLs, and URLs ending with ":<format>" or ".<format>". This allows manual activation—the location hash can for instance be used as follows to enable the stylesheet while browsing the introduction of an article:

https://example.com/plain-text-article#intro:text

Domains known to use these file extensions in URLs of their regular interface are excluded.
