### Description
Hides the Google Bar and auto-hides the toolbar with CSS animations. See the screenshots; look at the different combinations of colours and get creative!
With a minimal and intuitive design, this userstyle clears space and uncloggs the most essential part of Gmail: the content. Works well with Metro and Windows 8 too!

As for the animated GIF, I apologize in advance for the poor quality; the maximum file size was 100kB. Don't worry, the real thing looks much better.

 - Fixes Google Bar auto-hide to support users of Google+.

1.1.2
