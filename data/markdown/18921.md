### Description
So this style basically removes most of the ads from sajha.com homepage. It also makes it simpler, focusing just on the forums and thought box, bringing useful information to your notice. If I missed out any ads please let me know on my forum http://www.jhyaap.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=74 I'd be more than happy to fix it for you!

I've removed the picture from the thread page because, frankly, its really displeasing... so bear with that :D Hope you like it. Would love to hear your comments. 

If you like it, spread the word.
