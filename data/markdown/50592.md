### Description
To look good use: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/iconic-firefox-menu/

This style wouldn't exist without the great talent from foxxyn8 http://userstyles.org/users/25760, and everyone who in one way or another helped to create this.

Yet another transparent theme, the animation you see when a page is loading has been changed, blank pages are now displayed completely transparent, and also the reload/stop button has been moved to the left, tabs are a little thinner and favicons are smaller; i recommend you to put your home button next to the back/forward buttons, and to use small icons for it to look cool.
