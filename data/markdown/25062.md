### Description
I am splitting my facebook related styles into little "plugins" that you can download for full customization. It makes it easier for me to fix things, as well as for you to have facebook the way you like it. Feel free to request any plugins.

The "base" style is located here: http://userstyles.org/styles/24939

This module is in an early beta!! If you find anything wrong, please tell me.

Features:
-Makes Facebook a lot better for those with smaller displays. (Removes the rightmost column once things get to a small size)

Currently known bugs:
-news feed is too high, unless the right bar gets hidden.
-Profiles haven't been changed.

Changelog
