### Description
I decided to make this style since a lot of users dislike the white and questioned the colors in general. My style changes most things to green. The colors for different skill levels are the same as in the really old design. 

v2.0.8 - fixed graphical lineup
v2.0.7 - fixed the changed alternating rows
v2.0.6 - fixed background color for quotes on the new forum
v2.0.5 - fixed colors on the interaction page
v2.0.4 - added code for the updated match prediction pages
v2.0.3 - fix header underlining and the background of the round flag.
v2.0.2 - some minor fixes
v2.0.1 - fixed menu and probably some small details I can't remember.
v2.0 - fixed lots of details.
v2.0 beta - made for the new Freekick design, still lots of details to fix.
