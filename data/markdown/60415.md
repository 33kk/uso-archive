### Description
This style attempts to make a night mode for Mozilla Thunderbird. It changes the folder pane and thread pane text and background color to be visual friendly at night.

If you want a night vision for the preview pane as well. You can use a style called style 23516 by user 14255 and edit the style by adding this three things:

url-prefix(imap://)
url-prefix(mailbox://)
url-prefix(news://)

into the code:

@-moz-document url-prefix(http://), url-prefix(https://), url-prefix(ftp://), url-prefix(file://) {


PS: I am no expert on CSS coding (and any other coding!!). I hope this can help some night owl Thunderbird users and inspire some developer to create more styles that suitable for Thunderbird.
