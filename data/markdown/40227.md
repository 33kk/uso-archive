### Description
"IMO is a free web instant messenger that helps you IM, voice chat, and video conference using multiple instant messaging protocols."

This is an UPDATED userstyle for the new imo.im layout and is helpful for those at work behind a firewall. This is a new page since I lost my old login.

The window is defaulted at 20% opacity to make those pesky over-the-shoulder lookers none the wiser unless they are inches away from your screen. When you hover your mouse over, opacity is set to 50% during the entire time you are using the window, which still makes it difficult for a passerby to see what you're doing.

There is also an option for the screen to be at 100% opacity when you hover over it, as well as several other options depending on what you want the window to do.

NOTES: 
-If you are using the old IMO userstyle by me (tr1cky) you should disable or uninstall it.
