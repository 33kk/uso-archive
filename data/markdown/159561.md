### Description
My second try on modding 4chan's CSS. I've tried to give it a wider and cleaner feel.

Also, I had to diverge the filters since Fuck UserStyles.

Made with the thought on having 4chanX installed and JSON index deactivated.

This was made into a 1080x1920 and 1920x1080 resolutions, but should be easy to adapt if you need it.

### Update notes
================================Changelog================================

Updated to be working on 4channel url. If you find some issues feel free to message.

===============================Make it work===============================
Steps for Firefox:

A) Go to "Works in" choose "URL in the doman" type, exactly 4chan.org

B) Fix the import removing the comment and putting the @

C) Add another } at the end of the sheet.

Steps for Chrome/Vivaldi:

A) Copy the RegExp into the "Works in". Choose "match the RegExp". Leave only from "('http" to ".*"

B) Clean the top part of the sheet and leave only "@import" from the commented zone.

Ready to go :D
