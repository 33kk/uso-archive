### Description
Image Album: http://imgur.com/a/PczTb

A night theme for GamePolitics.com Dark backgrounds with light text. Also implements some ease of viewing changes compared to the current setup on the site (As of 2015-10-05).

Some of the implements are as follows: Alignments that were bugging my OCD. A replacement Tooltip for shoutbox comments. Additional default colors for signatures in comments.

The hex grid background is something I created. It's free for use, though it would be nice if you atleast acknowledge that it came from me if you use it.

The banner image is just a recolor of GP's normal header image. So nothing fancy there.

Check the top of the source to find more comments on who I thank for help on this.
