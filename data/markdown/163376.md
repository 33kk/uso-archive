### Description
This style mainly compresses your timeline in a vertical direction on TweetDeck so that you can see more tweets at the same time.
You can use either Light/Dark theme with this.
Your TweetDeck would be even better with BetterTweetDeck, not only with this style; I would recommend it if you wanted to tune TweetDeck more to your taste.

### Update notes
Additional Info
- <a href="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/163376_additional_31617.png?r=1535377064" target="_blank">EXTREME mode</a>
EXTREME mode is originally designed to be used in a small window.
It's a style just like IRC, but you need to customize everything to utilize it decently. 

Due to TweetDeck's specifications, EXTREME mode has a serious performance issue; but you can avoid it with <a href="https://openuserjs.org/scripts/pejuta/TweetDeck__Increases_the_amount_of_loaded_tweets" target="_blank">this userscript.</a>
Basically you should use the userscript if you want to use this mode.

- <a href="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/163376_additional_31645.png?r=1535680006" target="_blank">EXTRA EXTREME function</a>
This function modifies EXTREME mode and makes tweets thinner so that you can see more tweets at the same time.
If you enable this function, you should use <a href="https://openuserjs.org/scripts/pejuta/TweetDeck__Triple_the_amount_of_loaded_tweets" target="_blank">this userscript</a> instead of the previous one; at least you must use any of them or it will be a disaster.

Notice: If you use EXTRA EXTREME function, you should use <a href="https://openuserjs.org/scripts/pejuta/TweetDeck__Triple_the_amount_of_loaded_tweets" target="_blank">this userscript</a> instead of normal one.

18/08/29 v1.10
- Improved notification tab's style.

18/08/29 v1.09a
- Added a new function... or rather, I made it disablable: Hide "Show more" blocks.
- <a href="https://openuserjs.org/scripts/pejuta/TweetDeck__Increases_the_amount_of_loaded_tweets" target="_blank">Wrote a userscript which increases the max number of loaded tweets from 40 to 80.</a>
This must solve the scrolling down issue of EXTREME mode.
I recommend you to disable the above function for a reason when you use this script.

EXTREME mode is designed to be used in a small window.
If you don't get what "EXTREME" means, try it out.
(It's a style just like IRC. Expand columns and change every setting to utilize it decently.)
NOTE: It seems that on EXTREME mode there is a loading issue which is caused when you scroll down.
To avoid it, apply "moderate" settings or use it in a vertically short window. You can stop using EXTREME mode also.
