### Description
An update to my previous styles.  This new style incorporates/adjusts-to Google's June/July 2011 Calendar updates.  After applying this style, users will see the Google Search section disappear as well as the left-hand calendar tools.  

Set you Calendar settings to "Comfortable".

***NOTE*** Once this style is applied, you will NOT be able to change the colors of individual calendars, as these options are only accessible via the now-hidden, left-side panel.  Please set up your color schemes before enabling.  To make changes after enabling, please disable Stylish or unload this style.
