### Description
I can be found on Tumblr @ http://dearlydreams.tumblr.com

I created this theme on Mozilla Firefox, so I have no idea how it looks on Chrome.  This is a modified, updated version of the last one as Tumblr changed the dashboard around.  grumble grumble.

[[ To Install ]]
01. Download Stylish
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/
02. Click 'Install with Stylish' on the box on the right.
03. Sit back and look at the pretty.

Keep in mind that this theme does some goofy things to things I haven't been able to change, yet. Like the follow/dashboard links on profiles and the text boxes for posting.
