### Description
An edited version of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/97658/dark-night-archive-of-our-own">Dark/Night Archive of Our Own</a> for my own specifications and altered while overlaying the built-in Reversi Site Skin. (Honestly, I'm sharing it so I can move it to another computer I use.) Alterations include work text filling the screen, some button skinning (so they aren't flat), and colored links for previously viewed works.

### Update notes
<a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/97658/dark-night-archive-of-our-own">Dark/Night Archive of Our Own</a> originally by <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/195237">cicerakes</a>. Please attribute to them if sharing an alteration of this style.

21 March, 2017 update: Widened home page elements to better fit widescreen monitors.

10 October, 2017 update: Improved button styling so to retain more of intended style when not overlaying Reversi.

15 December, 2017 update: Some misc. edits I've made, mostly to checkboxes and making style changes important.

28 January, 2018 update: Color changes in tables, possibly only affecting users of "Extension of Our Own" Chrome extension.
"AO3rdr" Chrome extension specific edits, including better aligning the toolbar, and hiding just the toolbar on your personal pages by inserting your own username into the style.
If you do not use either of these Chrome extensions, this update may not effect your use.

2 May, 2018 update: Reversed some edits so that they would layer properly. This will make the replied checkmark and unread markers in the inbox appear as intended.

5 December, 2018 update: I noticed that H2 was nearly illegible, and was totally illegible in preview. Now red.

27 December, 2018 update: Altered the appearance of links, they should now be properly underlined as per normal, and the bottom border has been removed. This will make links no longer be double underlined while hovering. EDIT: a few minor fixes added.

5 September, 2019 update: Made expanding filter buttons legible.

22 April, 2020 update: Constrained Alert and Event banners to only appear on User pages, provided you apply your username to the style. Hopefully will also make the close button appear properly (I'm not sure why but it was being misplaced at some point).
