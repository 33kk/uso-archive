### Description
A dark/night theme for archiveofourown.org.
To make finding and reading fics easier on your eyes. :)
Includes options to change font and colours.
Also includes support for <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5835-ao3-kudosed-and-seen-history">kudosed and seen history</a> and <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/3144-ao3-kudos-hits-ratio">kudos/hits ratio</a> userscripts.

UserCSS version can be found <a href="https://github.com/cicerakes/DarkNight-AO3">here on GitHub</a>.

<u><b>I highly recommend switching to the <a href="https://github.com/cicerakes/DarkNight-AO3">UserCSS version</a> for more frequent updates (and using <a href="https://add0n.com/stylus.html">Stylus</a>)!</b></u>

Feel free to tell me any suggestions, or let me know about any issues.

Enjoy!

### Update notes
You can set the font size as a percentage (e.g. 105% would be 5% bigger than the default size). You can also use em, px, or pt.
If you want to use a different font, just replace whats in the box with what font you want (e.g. Arial) and install as normal.

I've made a guide for using the theme on mobile without the extension: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jUXPW">https://imgur.com/a/jUXPW</a> (the Stylish part is done in Chrome, so other browsers may differ). Custom fonts probably won't work on mobile.
