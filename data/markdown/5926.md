### Description
See http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8798 for the script (probably also works with the actual firefox extension as well, which I uninstalled due to bulk).
Note that you _MUST_ set to the larger popups for this to work right (but you probably have anyway).
I'm trying to figure out a way to make the popup follow the mouse like LinkThumb (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/23031), any help would be appreciated.

Removes the junk. When hovering a link at the bottom of the page, there's a space between the bottom of the window and the link (due to fixing a huge space between the balloon carrot and the balloon). If anyone can show me how to fix this, I'd be grateful.
