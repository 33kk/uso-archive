### Description
MAJOR updates coming.  Will be slicker but also lighter and faster - using much more CSS3 including gradients, transitions, etc.  Holding off releasing it until the official Firefox 4 launch for additional CSS3 support.

Subtle tweaks to make Reddit a bit more reader-friendly. It's meant to retain the recognizable look of Reddit while being easier on the eyes.

- Increased margins and white space for overall page, columns and story links
- Replaced Verdana with Helvetica (Lucida Grande/Sans and Arial as backups)
- Shifted to a less harsh color palette
- shrunk the right search/login column
- minimized the header a bit (full logo returned due to custom logo issues)
- reorganized comments with borders and backgrounds

-----update 08/31/10
- plenty of changes per requests from users and Reddit admin
- inclusion of icons, etc. in revised background sprite
- more cleanup on the comments view

Upcoming: I'm still unhappy with the overall balance, so I'll start work on finding my whitespace/margin zen. Also - Speed optimizations, revising background sprite for additional gradient backgrounds, improved icons, etc.
