### Description
Personalized presentation of the Google Groups web interface. My preferences include dark bg with light fg tones for easing tired eyes.
 * Updated 12 May 06: Tried to remove multiple BRs from quoted msg sections, and increase padding-top in them for symmetry. Also changed some colors.
 * Updated 24 May 06: Attempts to use CSS to remove trailing BRs from quotes just won't work. Opera 7 and 8 display these text blocks satisfactorily but FF displays them in a way that looks unbalanced. {sigh}. Removed the code that attempted this. Also fixed contrasting fg color for quoted text.
