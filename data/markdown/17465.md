### Description
03/14/2010 - Removed Virtual Gifts

02/09/2010 - MySpace decided to make their "Stream" mimic Facebook. I don't see a way to get the old tables back at all, but this update makes the 3 remaining, useful, the full width of the main table. Everything that is worthless, of course, is gone.

01/09/2010 - The ID's keep switching back and forth for me, so I edited the code to work with both.

01/08/2010 - MySpace changed the ID's for some fields. This update will fix it.

Updated for MySpace Home 1.3. Created with 1280x1024 resolution with MySpace's Stealth theme installed. It might work on other setups and it might not.

The new code is a re-work of "MySpace 1.3 Home Screen [Customized by TrYp MyNe]", because I'm too lazy to make my own since I don't use MySpace too much anymore.

It adds some features back, like apps, fixes thumbnails, and switches "bulletins" and "stream". If you have no idea what I'm talking about, don't worry about it.

Just update already.
