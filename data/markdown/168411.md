### Description
Change the colors of your Tumblr dashboard! (Unlike XKit extensions, this loads instantly.)

### Update notes
This isn't perfect -- I threw it together for personal use, to get rid of the eyeburning high-contrast stuff in 2019, but I've posted it here in hopes it'll help someone else.

By default, it should restore colors and text to that of the 2018 theme. But you can change the colors using the Customize Settings button (located beside the install button).

UPDATE: You can now customize text and post-background colors! These ONLY work on the 2020 beta dashboard. However, due to how the beta dashboard works, they are a little finicky. You have to enter the RGB values separated by commas. (For example: 1,234,56)

(You can get more detailed with some of the colors in the code editor. All the colors are at the top, so you don't have to go looking for them, and Stylus has a color picker and preview feature which should hopefully make it very easy.)

If I missed anything, please message me on tumblr! I'm babblingfishes there too.

<b>Changelog:</b>
2020-03-31:
- Added two new color options:
-- Bright Button (which was previously controlled by the Chat Post color)
-- Notes Highlight (the color used to highlight mutuals if they show up in a post's likes/reblogs list)
- Fixed the following bugs:
-- Fixed some variable name collisions and protected against future ones.
-- The old font didn't consistently match the old font size.
-- If you clicked an image to view it fullsize, the background wasn't transparent.
-- If someone followed you, the button to follow them back on your activity page was the wrong color.
2020-03-30:
- Now overrides most of the beta dashboard colors (note icons and some other small details can't be changed)
- Added option to override the beta dashboard font with the old dashboard font.
- Added (janky) options for beta dash post backgrounds and text color.
2020-02-18:
- Fixed transparent overlay color again.
2020-02-16:
- By harassing one of my mutuals with 2000 likes/unlikes, I have finally identified and replaced the color for the heart that floats up when you like something. I am so sorry, mutual.
- I have also done this for reblog icon. (This fix only took 3 reblogs, because most of it was right next to the code for the heart.)
- Fixed some buttons that would turn blue for 0.1 seconds when you click them.
- Fixed an issue with the "White" option for Choose-New-Post-Type buttons.
2020-02-11 part 2:
- I've noticed that Tumblr's dumb Choose-New-Post-Type overlay (the one that comes up when you hit the pencil button in the top right corner) uses images instead of icons, so I can't change their colors via code. I have, however, added a few different options: Old colors, black, white, grayscale, and sepia. Be aware -- it's a little hacky. If things get weird, just select the "New Colors" option, which reverts the Choose-New-Post-Type overlay back to tumblr's default code.
2020-02-11:
- Fixed an issue where post notification icons for transparent photosets would have a red background.
- Addressed some unaddressed cancel button colors.
- Finally found and corrected the sides of the "related blog" previews on the search page.
- "Keep Reading" link color now matches the color of all other buttons.
2019-02-18 part 2:
- Fixed the login page, including the intro showcase, just in case you wanted to see that for some reason.
- Fixed the login/sign-up buttons visible when logged out on the Explore page.
- Fixed the elevator button on the Explore page.
2019-02-18:
- Fixed an issue where permalink corner was the wrong color on "peepr" (on-dash blog view) pages.
- Tumblr has now baked the changes in, breaking the entire theme. Now it should be fixed again (I hope).
2019-02-09:
- Fixed some miscellaneous missing colors, mostly from the activity panel.
- Discovered that some button hover effects broke. And they're still broken.
