### Description
This is an edit to the Simple Myspace userstyle that removes all ads from the landing page, home, profile, schools, search, messaging, and blog sections of myspace (all the sections I use regularly).  It also readds the schools box back in, as that's something I use.

I did not bother with forums, videos, comedy etc, but can adjust for those sites as needed.

This hack works great with Firefox's NoScript plugin.
