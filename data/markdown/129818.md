### Description
Note: TabCenter is in constant change and I'm trying to keep up, but each new TC update can break this theme.

A second iteration of the previous Heartbeat theme. As usual this theme works best with Firefox Developer Edition, Black Theme. Some elements might need tweaking on your system. Also, I use a FullHD screen, so YMMV.

Recommended setup:
Ubuntu 16.04;
Firefox Dev Edition, dark theme;
Numix theme for gnome;

This and other styles are provided as is and I give no warranty that they won't set you on fire. Feel free to ask me for help here or on reddit.

Things I would like to do at some point:
- Test in different systems and screens.
- Make all colors and values use CSS vars
- Make style customizable through userstyles interface.
