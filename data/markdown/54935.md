### Description
Removes all the excess crap from BYU's new myBYU "portal".  This style makes it easy to find and use the Route Y links -- which is the only reason anyone goes to myBYU in the first place.

Supports a light and dark color theme.

### Update notes
IMPORTANT:

Make sure your default myBYU tab displays the "Campus Links (Route Y)" element.  This is the default, I believe, but if the page is completely blank with this style then it's probably not being shown.
