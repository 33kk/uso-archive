### Update notes
/* 200417 */

Remove most customization options, please use "Search and Replace" function of your fav text editor instead.

/* 121116 */

Add regular expression to match certain address pattern, so most pods can simply use most functions of the theme without manually adding domain. If you find this userstyle interfere with other websites you use, you have to remove relative regexp address at the beginning of the stylesheet and add your domain.

/* 260916 */

Add better support for mobile version.


/* 240816 */

Tweaking code content, hmm, I use vim desert theme but different people may prefer different theme. Related codes are listed at the beginning of this stylesheet, you can modify them as you like.
