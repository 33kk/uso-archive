### Description
So GoogleCode sorta just locked me out of my own project.
I have been working on something better.



A lot of chans have either died, or exploded.
So I'm thinking about proxying and rebooting this style back to usable.

But in the meantime:
Tidied the post form and fixed the impossible-to-see checkboxii.
Personally, I think the disappearing Browse button is hilarious. And I have no clue why it does that. At all.
BUT doesn't clicking on the file text box bring up the same prompt? It does on XPx64. OS sensitive? I dunno. It will be fixed in future versions, though.

Enjoy! Maybe!

Stuff this does (most recent updates are last):
Cyan/white on darker grays/black.
Full sized images opened in new tabs/windows are centered.
Makes the +/- box the whole width of the board category name. Looks a lot like 2ch.us' Menu.
Board directory fits into its frame better, no horizontal scrolling unless you increase the text size.
Image thumbnails have a loading .gif behind them. If this becomes a problem, I'll just take it out.
Removed that dotted outline FireFox puts around focused objects in the Board Directory.
A line-through has replaced the focus image.
Marks the Spoilers tagged in bbcode with a warning.
The different thread buttons (Hide/Watch/Expand/Quick Reply) have a new background to fit the dark theme and their backgrounds change while hovered over.
Full page ads (failchan) are now huge "Skip this ad" buttons.
WIP Universal adblock. (This will also block bitefight/badjasmine/outwar links if you have Linkification. Comment if something is incorrectly blocked.)
WIP Text Board Support! If you use the text boards, use the FutaTXT or Terminal style option.
Replaced those horizontal bars with pretty borders that also show up in the. . .
New post area! Which also contains. . .
New Buttons!
Added some more chans, including Overchan V.2
By popular request (2 people), the file field is back... even thought it never left... it was just invisible... and still accessible...
1000 Downloads!!! and FilterChan!!!
