### Description
[UPDATED FOR THE NEW TWITTER LAYOUT]

This is made as a counterpart of <a href=http://userstyles.org/styles/97283/>this</a> userstyle, instead of username, this style will remove fullnames and stylize the username (15px font, bold and oblique) so it'll be looked like their actual fullname.

BONUS:
- An option to make the tweets text also oblique, disabled by default.
- An option to change whole twitter's font to Calibri, enabled by default (as seen in the screenshot).

### Update notes
Again, on the who to follow box:
this style *won't* remove their fullnames there

AND

'@' signs and the usernames on the profile page are now combined, so '@' signs are still visible there
