### Description
Make directory listings from ftp and the local system look nicer.

This is just a bug-fix release of user 74's stellar "style 210 [sic]."


CHANGED ITEMS
If you open these two styles in a graphical diff program like gvimdiff or tkdiff, you'll see that I changed very little.

Minor fixes implemented from comments on style 210

For file://, I moved the non-table parts into an ftp-only  section and then demanded explicit hierarchy for the table elements, based on the post-rendered hierarchical structure of:

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><!-- snip -->
<body>
<h1><!-- snip --></h1>
<hr><table>
<tbody>
<!-- entire content lies here -->
<!-- snip -->

CSS lets us specify an elements by parents, elder siblings, and exact attribute content for each element/parent/sibling.  This lets me use every non-snipped bit above, thus mostly eliminating collisions with Sage (whatever that is) and non-auto-generated local html content.  You can find more on this at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html

KNOWN BUGS

File:// indexes have larger margins, HR bars at the top and bottom, and the default heading format.  I cannot fix that without affecting all local HTML documents.  user 74's solution was to not render file:// indexes at all.
