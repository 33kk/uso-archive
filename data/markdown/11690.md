### Description
Displays rounded boxes around every entry in a RSS feed. So you can better keep the different entries apart. Additionally, the link color was changed to a more "soft" color, and a hover effect was added.

Note: better disable the style if you are not reading a RSS feed, or if you have a fast computer. I could'nt find an exacting namespace than HTML, because RSS feeds can be everywhere. So I decided to use the id "feedHandler" of HTML element to find out weather it's a feed.
