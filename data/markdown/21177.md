### Description
Infolinks are annoying advertising balloons that, for some reason, adblock doesn't kill.  This removes the balloons and normalizes the underlying text.

For a demonstration see this page http://www.dumblittleman.com/2006/10/40-ways-to-make-money-on-internet.html

Let me know if you find a page where it doesn't work.  It doesn't work on the infolinks web site because it uses a different format.

29 October 2009 - Updated to include Kontera links.
21 October 2009 - Updated.
