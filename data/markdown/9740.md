### Description
This is a variation of style 1862 by user 1061. Basically just taking the same idea a little farther, further removing things that don't interest me personally. Also increases some font sizes. Best when used with my favorite nyt greasemonkey scripts   (remove flash ads, interstitial ads and permalinker and doubleclick dictionary blocker, all here: http://userscripts.org/users/63041/favorites)
