### Description
Today <a href="pcpartpicker.com>PC Partpicker</a> updated their site which is really snazzy! But there are some minor details that were bugging me (as of now just the links on the homepage being hard to click) so I fixed them. You can also optionally swap the left and right columns! (use the dropdown)
