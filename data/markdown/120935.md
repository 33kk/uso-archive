### Description
Prevents the Lichess board from wiggling/jittering/shifting back and forth when there are too many spectators watching a game by hiding the scrollbar during games and while watching Lichess TV.
****
Here's a new solution that maintains the scrollbar but contains the spectators so the page stays the same height throughout the game: https://userstyles.org/styles/121112/trap-spectators-in-a-box-lichess-org
