### Description
Mostly done.  The logged in parts haven't been finished but almost all of the site while logged out works for the most part.

This is ugly uncleaned code but it works.  I'll organize it better once it's done.  Slashdot is such a pain to try and code for because their code base is absolute rubbish, reminds me of all the table based layouts back in the day.
