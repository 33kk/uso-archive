### Description
This style, in my opinion, makes the new style of thedailywtf.com (formerly worsethanfailure.com, formerly thedailywtf.com (yes, they renamed back)) *much* more readable by changing colours to contrast better, adding borders where needed and changing margins and padding so elements fit better together. In particular, it colours nested comments appropriately up to four levels deep; I haven't seen any comments that use more nested comments than that but any that do will retain the darkest colour. And besides, the borders are much easier to see anyway.
