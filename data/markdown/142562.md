### Description
You can apply your own wallpaper in the advanced settings below.
<br>
This was made to satisfy what I wanted the website to look like. This is not a conceptual theme like the previous osu!next conceptual theme.
<br>
Wallpapers that have more going on in them are more likely to look good.
