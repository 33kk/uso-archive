### Description
Makes About:Robots more fun by displaying a faded Mozilla Robot picture.
Also changes the round bullets of the list to a small picture of a robot (Bulleted / Unordered List)
about:robots can be accessed via the locationbar, and displays fun Robot Facts, with a Mozilla focus...  Another excellent way to implement a new UI feature for your favorite web browser.

Integrates with Style 7066, along with all my other About: page customizations.

Features:
- Appears on about:robots
- Fully customizable style, for your own enjoyment.

Instructions:
You may also change the background HEX color to match your image.  The background color of text in this style has not been changed.

LouCypher:
There is nothing I can do, the Original About:robots page uses your "cute robot" As a positioned background image.  So adding MY personal background image makes it disappear!

Changelog:
1.0.0.4:
+ Added LouCypher's Cute Robot.  Thanks!!
+ Added another new After Screenshot to reflect the changes of the new image

1.0.0.3:
+ Locally Encoded the new PNG Background - Now it will work offline, and will not connect
+ Added new After Screenshot to reflect the changes of the new background image

1.0.0.2:
+ Added new Robot Image, utilizing all of the area given, and not tiling, thanks to LouCypher and Zoolcar9.
- Removed code to repeat background image

1.0.0.1:
+ Fixed Issue with Image not showing
