### Description
Makes the header stay at the top of the page (not sticky), and takes care of the whole inversion/transparency thing.

Normally, when scrolling down, the header follows you and becomes transparent. This style will make sure it stays at the top of the page, and removes the transparency (so that there is no flickering when scrolling up fast). This script also removes the message about accepting cookies (it was causing some issues on chrome).

It should work on any wikia website, start a discussion if it doesn't work on a particular one.
