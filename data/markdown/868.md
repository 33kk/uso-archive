### Description
DSmeet offers a table with Metroid Prime Hunters statistics for all registered users who have linked their DS to their Nintendowifi.com account.
This CSS mod will make the table full-width, since the table is quite squished on a 1024x768 monitor. This also eliminates the sidebars and the logo.
