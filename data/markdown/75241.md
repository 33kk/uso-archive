### Description
A theme for the ever-so-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's shipping, Faithshipping. I will admit I'm not one who sips this myself but I know a lot of people in the 5D's fandom do so here you all go! I didn't want to make it too complex and have a lot going on or it would take away the value of the ship. 
I hope anyone who uses it likes it!
