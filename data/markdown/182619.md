### Description
Mastodon's "advanced web interface" has statically sized columns that don't fill the page when you only have a couple of columns pinned.

This style will sets the toot drawer to 20% of the page width, the first pinned column, (whatever it is) to about 50% of the page width, and the last column to 30%. When only those three are on the page you get a nicely balanced three-column layout.

Additionally, when you have more columns, the first and last try to retain some proportionality while they shrink to accommodate the new columns, and standard behaviour is retained when the number of columns exceeds the page width.
