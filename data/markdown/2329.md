### Description
A subtle about:blank style which shows a very faded watermark of the Firefox logo. Gentle on the eyes, but stylish.

I was actually surprised no one did this yet.


CHANGELOG:  

1.0.1 - 
Original release.

1.1.0 -
FEATURE: Base64-encoded images are now used instead of hotlinked images from my server.
FIX: Added a background color declaration to override the default color of Firefox.
REMOVAL: The larger image is not available in this new version because of space constrains for the maximum character limit at userstyles.org.
