### Description
I can't stand the bright yellow on the default layout. It makes things very difficult to read for me. This is a simple CSS retheme that I think makes it easier on the eyes.

Threw it together in about half an hour. Could be improved in various ways, I'm sure, but I'm happy with it for now.
