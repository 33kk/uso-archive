### Description
An updated version of an old style allowing custom username colors to be used client-side.

This can be manually expanded far beyond 10 users by editing the script within Stylish.

### Update notes
After further testing, it seems this style does not work with popout chat. I'm unsure if I'll be able to correct this and currently don't have the time to attempt it. I will see about getting around to fixing it when I have time to do so. For now though, it does work as long as you using the standard sidebar chat.
