### Description
Hide Caption Titlebar Plus has been limited by a new Firefox interface change since 12.0a1 version. HCTP 2.6.0 was released to mitigate this problem, but if certain HCTP settings are used, this causes Min-Max-Close button box misalignment.
<b>UPDATE: Newer versions of HCTP have been released solving the major issues covered by this userstyle,</b> but depending on your settings it's still useful, plus it provides some extra solutions.
