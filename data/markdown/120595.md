### Description
Updated: 28 May 2018

Icons fixed - i know this was an issue for a while.  Soon I'll have this theme mirror my Dark Blue theme, but I'll modify the color scheme to be dark grey instead of dark blue (of course).

This is based off of:

Gmail Dark Energy
https://userstyles.org/styles/111445/dark-energy-gmail

This theme is designed for Firefox and Pale Moon.

There's still some unthemed bits to some of the popup/flyout windows/menus.  I'll get to these when I can.

===========================

For a blue theme check this style:
https://userstyles.org/styles/122635/gmail-dark-blue

This Dark Blue style is one I designed from the ground up.  It may start getting more attention than "Gmail Dark #1".
