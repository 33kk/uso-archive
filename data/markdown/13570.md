### Description
This style is okay, but it's simpler to just use the Blank Your Monitor add-on for firefox instead: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blank-your-monitor-easy-readin/

This is a nice backbone to build simple styles, or just leave as is if you're a robot like me and only want to see information.

  Main issues:
  * I need user input to tell me if this breaks anything so I can make exceptions.
  * Messes up sites that use background images for information
  * In particular, it messes up google maps (though it's still usable)
  * Can't consistently alter buttons, text fields, menu-boxes, etc.  (See http://sdf1.org/links/1231438650
     for an explanation of why)  So you have to customize them to your operating system and browser
  * This even changes some of vimperator's colors
  * Messes up black transparent images

  * Any advice is welcome!
