### Update notes
OLD CHANGELOG: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=eFRGcniF

- 17.02.2014 - Rewrote the code completely from scratch! made it a lot thinner :)
but still:
*need to make the video-upload page dark
*need to implement support for a non-fixed topbar
*need to work on a couple of details
- until then, have a lot of fun with it and please keep on reporting in those bugs! THANKS! :) -

- 21.02.2014 - YOUTUBE YOU MAKE ME SICK!
repaired most of the damage that the new youtube layout has brought! 
also added the dropdown option for a non-sticky topbar :)

- 25.04.2014 - Small fixes, TokHaar helped again! :) props!
*white underlayed text has been fixed
*a couple of buttons and borders have been changed to the style-standards
*the playlist preview-list has been covered in chocolat - nah not really but it looks nice now

- 14.11.2014 - @Hrtz: Thanks again for the small fixes you provided! Did some media query magic to kill the player-size bugs, included a sprite file and filled in some more color - sorry for the very big wait, IM NOT DEAD YET, ADMONG! >:(
