### Description
Simple style, that removes a lot of the clutter from the sidebar in Google Drive.

I often use laptops with very short screens, so when I try to drag files to the trash and the folder structure opens, the trash can scrolls behind the usage stats and I can't drop it in. This fixes that problem by removing all of the features I don't use from the Drive sidebar. Feel free to download and edit any of the buttons back in if you want them. Just comment out the appropriate line(s).
