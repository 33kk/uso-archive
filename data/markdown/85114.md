### Description
Makes reddit look like an Android 4.x holo dark app, with emphasis on minimizing wasted space (huge margins / padding) as well as modernizing (web 2.0'ing!) the color scheme.

For best results, set your Feedly theme to "Black Cats" and install the Ubuntu font family - http://font.ubuntu.com.
