### Description
Don’t like to scroll around for navigation in the official GIMP documentation? Try this!

It fixates the navigation header and navigation footer do the top/bottom of the display area of firefox.

The F’KING screenshot obligations are too restrictive for me for adding a screenshot, so just have a look at the Gimp documentation at docs.gimp.org and imagine the orange navigation bars not to scroll around, f you scroll, but staying at the same - always visible - positions while you scroll the page.
