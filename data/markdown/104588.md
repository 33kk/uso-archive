### Description
In <a href="http://vipracing.tv/">VipRacing.TV</a> (official partner of Rojadirecta) the remaining ADS are removed (I use  <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/firefox">Adblock Plus</a> and <a href="https://greasyfork.org/scripts/735-anti-adblock-killer-reekAnti-Adblock Killer">Anti-Adblock Killer</a> to remove the ads first) and the Video Player is centered. Also, everything outside the video is now darker, to allow a more immersive experience. Enjoy your Formula 1, Moto GP, Football and other sports in a cleaner UI.
