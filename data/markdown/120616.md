### Description
ACTUALLY SEE what emails are NEW or old! Adds borders to inbox messages! It's not pretty but it's effective! I made certain colors obnoxious on purpose to highlight things that are important to me. If you don't like the colors, edit the hex codes in the CSS.

[rant] *sigh* It's a shame that Microsoft thinks the way to fix its interfaces is to optimize /everything/ for mobile touchscreens, while PC users remain their most loyal customers. You're pushing away the only people who want to love you, Microsoft! [/rant]
