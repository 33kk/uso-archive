### Description
A lightweight ROBLOX font customizer.

This style works absolutely great, and does not have any bugs, but you do have to manually change the font (if you want to). You can change fonts in the CSS editor, in Stylus/Stylish.

Here is a list of fonts you can choose from:
Arial	
Helvetica
Verdana
Calibri
Noto
Lucida Sans
Gill Sans
Century Gothic
Candara
Futara
Franklin Gothic Medium
Trebuchet MS
Geneva
Segoe UI
Optima
Avanta Garde

Although, there is probably more fonts you can choose, which are not on that list. Feel free to experiment!
