### Description
Just an another scrollbar... well, maybe not entirely! 

You can choose between <strike>three</strike> <b>four</b> styles & the thickness of the scrollbar's thumb (the scrollbar itself is transparent), see  <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/653">picture</a>
You can also choose if the thumb should always stay visible, or visible only when you hover over (move mouse to the right side or bottom)

Created to match my theme <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/45089/glassfox-a-clean-theme">GlassFox</a>, but that's optional of course.
