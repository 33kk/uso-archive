### Description
Reverts the tumblr sidebar to something similar to its old format. Because flat and 'minimalist' do not equal user-friendly or aesthetically pleasing.

<b>If you're having spacing issues</b> such as seen in <a href="http://forum.userstyles.org/uploads/FileUpload/66/6f51e4fc631f8ff995e8b62ba35382.png">this screenshot</a> provided by <a href="http://userstyles.org/users/211995">AriAmi</a>, try choosing 'no' on the "Slim Sidebar?" option. It's also important that you select 'no' if you use XKit's option to slim the sidebar instead. Otherwise, it's highly suggested you keep the sidebar slimmed as the buttons are horribly large by default.

<b>Hide New Labels</b> option refers to the headers that say "account" and "recommended blogs". They're hidden by default with the option 'yes' to make the sidebar appear more like I remember the classic one. Just select 'no' to keep them, and they'll be styled appropriately to look right rather than hidden.

### Update notes
<b>If you use a custom dashboard theme</b>, install the twin of this style, found <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/94192/tumblr-sidebar-fix-for-custom-themes">by clicking here</a> instead. That one has no embedded colours, and thus should work well with most custom themes.

This is already installed and colour-coordinated on dashboard themes that I made; there's no need to install it if you're using one of my dash themes. 

Working on a fix for notifications and other flattened elements, but it may take a while. Also, as you can see from the screenshots, this clearly works with themes that customize the text of different sidebar sections. The one in use is <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/73989/followers-to-werewolves-tumblr">Followers to Werewolves</a>.

<b>Should now work with SSL security enabled.</b>
