### Description
I declare forfeit. Too much a hassle to maintain, their CMS or whatever makes a mess of the css every 2-3 weeks. On FF, Dark Reader does the trick as an addon even if it's heavy on the browser performances.
---
A soft dark mode for patreon users.
To be clear and honest it might not be up-to-date all the time (but I'll try) ; I just made it & share for all the users (creators like me or patrons) who could be interested in this mode.
Not every pages are tweaked ; only the most used ones.
You can easily tweak the main colors (it uses vars).

Their code is so messy (on purpose?) it's a pain to keep a css working more than a month.
