### Description
Fixing Twitter's user interface blunders one at a time.

This fix restores <b>proper username order</b> in your timeline: @username first, display name second. This way the <i>one</i> thing you need to remember about an account actually becomes visible again.

It also restores a bit of UI integrity, since the @username is what appears in the tweet text and it's what you use to mention people. Twitter's user auto-complete does an extremely poor job when you try to mention someone by their display name - and the display name can change whenever the user feels like it anyway, resulting in completely needless confusion.

Additionally it puts the <b>Tweet time</b> in a predictable place, i.e. into the top right corner.
