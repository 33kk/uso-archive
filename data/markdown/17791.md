### Description
Google powered by Mac OS X.

Top search box is fixed for easy operation when using Autopagerize greasemonkey script.  I use modified version by os0x: http://github.com/os0x/autopagerize/tree/master
In screenshot below, faviconize greasemonkey script: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/34035 by janus_wel is also used.

There is fancier balloon for options.  It uses codes which works only with Firefox 3.5 or Safari so it is commented out for now.  If you are advanced user, you can enable it in the code.

NOTE:
There is some problem displaying if you are using Adblock Plus extention.  See discussions for more.

Check out my other styles for Google:
style 18188
style 17901
style 16900
