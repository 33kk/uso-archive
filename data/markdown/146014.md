### Description
The scrolling ticker draws my attention away from the video.
This is an attempt to hide it. (but show it when hovering over the video)
This has not been tested on displays with resolution lower than 1280x800 or higher than 1920x1080.

Feel free to fix (or improve) it. I'm not a programmer, just desperate to remove the distracting ticker.

3/12/18 I'm no longer seeing a ticker even without this style. Did they come to their senses and get rid of it? Time will tell.  :-)
