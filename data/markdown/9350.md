### Description
The idea here is to use minimum real estate used for the Menu Toolbar, and other toolbars, so that you have more screen space to use your browser for it's intended purpose of looking at web pages not space hogging graphics.    

This is one of several styles to minimize size of toolbars, look for other styles under my name, David McRitchie, that include "Minimal" in their style names. Currently there is some overlap in toolbars, since I've not learned how to reduce the size of the selection bubbles to be within the toolbars height, but it is quite usable.
