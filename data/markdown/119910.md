### Description
Just returned to playing MouseHunt and I was a little disappointed to find the text is still as small as I remembered it to be. So I tweaked the text where it seems too small or too old, using font type Arial and Calibri instead of Tahoma.

Oh, and added a soft pale yellow background which made everything look nicer somehow. @_@

PS. I didn't cover everything because there's bound to be locations I have yet to reached with newer UI. Will update the style if I modified more stuff.
