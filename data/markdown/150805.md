### Description
Let's say you're a busy ServiceNow developer and you spend most of your time on a dev instance. You switch over to your production instance to pick up a case. Before installing this style, you might've forgotten to switch back to dev and done something disastrous. But with this handy banner, you'll always remember you're on prod and your coworkers will be in awe at your organizational skills.
