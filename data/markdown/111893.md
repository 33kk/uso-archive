### Description
When I use some common web sites, including Google Search and Yahoo, I want the ads, but they are not as clearly distinguished as I want them.  This is a very simple style to highlight the ads on the page.

### Update notes
You could hack this up to remove the ads entirely, but I didn't want to.  The main value that this script provides is the knowledge og what the ad divs are called.  I will try to maintain this script to update those when and if they change.

I have not tried to change the style of the "tabular" shopping results, as those are already distinguished enough for me.

2017-01-26: Yahoo search changed div, added ads class.
2018-03-15: Added div.ad in cse.google.com
2020-04-11: Updated cse.google.com
