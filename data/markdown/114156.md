### Description
Do you have no gold or maana? Do you want to look cool, cute, or pretty but you don't really want to use real money? Are you sick of me speaking like this? Because I do, and I made this for people who want to "wear" items.

Other items you may want to use: URL - http://markable.in/file/68fe232c-acb6-11e4-b543-00259026e590/

All you have to do is to wear the items on the second picture and copy/paste the url of the item you want to wear in it's proper spot!

follow pic example.

!!!!ATTENTION!!!!

Do you see the thing saying "current skin" and other ones with a number there. Well, that's the element number of the default eldarya skin. Meaning, if you found your current skin's element number and put it there, you don't have to wear that skin to edit!!!. I'll upload a link to a tutorial of how to 1) get url's for items. 2) find element number of what you're wearing. Which means all kind of items (except animation) would be available!! ♪┏(・o･)┛♪┗ ( ･o･) ┓♪

### Update notes
To use items from shop, you need to try item on, right click and find the item's url that's with "full product" and copy url into the style.

For marketplace items, right click and use the item's url.

All items are for free (from episodes) I didn't want to make one for the other categories because the idea of this style is to not have to buy something.

If there's any problems or mistakes, contact me on tumblr at lilian-akuma.tumblr.com

Have fun!
