### Description
This tweaks the style of the buttons that are placed in the Add-on Bar. The buttons will now appear to be more compact, have tighter corners and will have lost their drop-shadows. This also forced buttons to conform to the minimum height of other buttons (18px).

WORKS WELL WITH:
Hide StatusBar Shim on AddonBar: http://userstyles.org/styles/38500
Aero Glass For AddonBar: http://userstyles.org/styles/38528

2010/12/11: Updated! A recent change on the part of Mozilla meant that buttons were bloated. This has now been fixed to compensate for that change.
2011/01/04: Updated! Restores button styling to the buttons. Still needs some work, but this is at least something for now. Also fixes an issue with badly aligned buttons e.g. NoScript.
