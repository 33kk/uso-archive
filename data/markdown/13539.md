### Description
Based on style 7173 by user 7858.

Hides the search bar go button when not typing into the search textbox, matching the behavior of location bar.

Users of Searchbar Autosizer add-on by xeen (http://searchbarautosizer.mozdev.org/) who have set it to dinamically adjust width of the search bar have to click on the textbox and then click away to make it stretch. This operation is to be made only once after loading the style into Stylish. However, after rebooting the browser, everything works correctly.
Who wants on the contrary to prevent the name of the search engine to overrun the space of the go button have to install my style 13543 and set opacity to zero.
