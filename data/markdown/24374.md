### Description
BETTER FOX 3.6

I Recommend you all to use Aero Buddy ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/63130 ) with this user script for perfect experience.

For those who want minimalistic & futuristic Firefox. :)

Tweaks:
#No More IE Like Navigation Buttons - This was causing issues with other themes. See preview , im running the script on theme "Purity" (NEW)
#Slight Fixes in positions , looks better now (NEW)
#No Identity Icon in Awesomebar 
#Other Tweaks to increase work area )
#Round Navigation Bar Right Edge 
#Hidden tab list button
#Smaller Firefox Awesome Bar Text, Fits more on the screen
#No Bookmark star and live feed icon in Address url toolbar
#Slim tabs
#Combine Stop and Reload (Reload should be @ right)
