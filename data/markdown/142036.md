### Description
Compact hangouts style, that somewhat emulates old Google Talk. The text blocks are more uniform size, the sender image is removed, the text arrows are flipped (so that your text is on the left, and others on the right). On the top of CSS, color variables are set, so you can easily set up your own color scheme.
