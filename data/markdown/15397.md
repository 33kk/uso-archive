### Description
This style attempts to eliminate much of the visual clutter and clunkiness of the RTM UI. It is optimized for users with higher screen resolutions of at least 1000px wide and is focused on "task-centric" users. Works great when you convert RTM to a menu item using Fluid in OS X.

Features:

No Cow
No footer
No search
Improved Nav
Reduce Clutter
Spacing on tasks
Larger font for tasks
