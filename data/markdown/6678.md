### Description
White style for the very dark Darkside_RG Release Group.  This style greatly increases readability with vista's Calibri font, as well as the wonderful white, red/orange, and black styling.  


Features:
- Calibri font  (Supports Windows XP and Windows 9x by including "Arial" as
the secondary Font-Family if Calibri is not found.)
- White background for each page, table data, and paragraph
- Black background, Orange text for headings
- Easy to read forum post headings and item headings
- Light white background and black text for forum details


Additional Information:
DarksideRG uses vBulletin, so this style could be compatible with other such forums.  Now you can call it Lightside RG!

Changelog:
1.0.0.3:
+ Updated style domain to point to new server of 94.75.224.58

1.0.0.2:
+ Added support for the actual darksiderg.com domain (web logon for this site)!

1.0.0.1:
- Removed the header image logo.  This was causing some odd display issues with a white box to the right.  Now the site looks better, and I still am looking into coding in a new white logo.
* If you wish to re-display the header logo, please delve into the code and remove the very last style item (commented).
