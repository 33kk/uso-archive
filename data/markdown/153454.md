### Description
This is a dark theme for reddit that fixes the header to the top of the page and also moves the search bar to the header. This theme is also easily convertible into a light theme by deleting code 2 in the style editor. Designed to work with reddit enhancement suite (RES) just make sure to use the RES night mode. This theme does not work very well if you don't turn off the subreddit styles in the reddit settings.
