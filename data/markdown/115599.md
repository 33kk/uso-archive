### Description
<strong>I am officially discontinuing all my TweetDeck themes, so they may be outdated, but feel free to fork them (they now are into the public domain)!</strong>

This style needs to be used with the light theme of TweetDeck, otherwise it will be ugly !

This is a red soviet version of Light TweetDeck themes.
