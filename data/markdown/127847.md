### Description
Mozilla released their new Tab Center to Test Pilot Users on May 12th and I decided to tweak Tilezilla to fit my design needs.
I changed the margins a bit so that only the icons show in the tab, but the text is still visible on mouse over. I also increased the transition time for the on-hover animation.
