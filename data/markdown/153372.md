### Description
A theme, that makes Facebook a simpler, and more fluent experience.

Main features: The top "bluebar" is white, and the searchbox takes up its full height. Post containers don't have borders, and its edges are curved, as well as dropdown menus'. The default font is Montserrat, imported from the Google font library.

Have fun using this theme! :)
