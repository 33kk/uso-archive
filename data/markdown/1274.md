### Description
You think the EI online edition is too cluttered with divs you don't need? Use this style and everything but the search form and the content is stripped away. Also, the print view is modifies to change link colors back to black. Who wants to know that you could go to this or that article if you were in a browser and not reading a piece of paper?
