### Description
Little doodle-css for 4chan.org I did while bored.

If you're using 4chanX or something that replaces the post window, pick No below.
If you're using the original post window, pick Yes.

>2012
>Not using 4chanX/+ whatever

### Update notes
>Added Chrome support
>Fixed lines showing up (hurr testing themes with adblock element hiding rules sure is smart)

>11/1/12
Updated a few things to fix bugs on boards without spoiler tags, as per bug report, and fixed the background in place to prevent visual bugs

>14/1/12
Added an option to have typical post-box functionality (stuck at the top of the page)
Select Yes for both Classic Post Window and Fixed Post Window.

>15/1/12
Added a quick little mod to get the page name and logo back. (Also fixed it so it bumps down the postbox and goes behind replies if the window width is really small)

>13 May 12
Fixed the pagination on HTML5. OPs, for now, still use 4chanX as a dependancy.
