### Description
UPDATED VERSION FOR THE NEW PLUGIN I GUESS.

I recently made my own Soundcloud Theme for firefox (also works with chrome!) because I was bored and wanted to have my own one.
Since it might be something that not just me would like to use I thought I'd release it here.
I don't know if - or how good it will look on screen resolutions which aren't 1920x1080 / 16:9 since I made it fit into my firefox. Using the dark standard theme for firefox since my older plugins don't work anymore.

Whats special?
- Background is slightly visible, giving it a slight look like there's light shining inside a dusty room 
- Playback bar at the bottom has a tiny animation going from left to right, creating some kinda "loading" effect (you'll see.., can be deactivated in the settings here)
- Hovering over an image in your home/stream with the mouse will invert the image, why? Because it's possible and gives some variety, something new :)

### Update notes
Found something in white or have a request that I should change because it doesn't fit for you? Let me know.
