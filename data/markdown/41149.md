### Description
Combined style 41126 that I made (a mod of style 7008 by user 7807) with the right side tabs idea from style 20250 by user 26856. 

Enjoy.

Notes: Still need to work on what happens with long Folder names. It has a good amount of space, but if you have a very long folder name, it messes up the alignment of the count slightly.
