### Description
!! IMPORTANT !!
Go to gmail themes on the preference dropdown
and change your theme to dark and select a nice
dark background image to go with it. This script
only alter the mail reading panel. The inbox list
will be controlled by the gmail internal theme,
this is to prevent heavy dependence on 3rd party
restyling.

Read your mail in dark grey background. Enjoy.
