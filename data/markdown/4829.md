### Description
http://www.computerworld.com/

just the article, nowt else (:

OK this one is a real hack up, as in it will mess up the computerworld front page and some other pages on CW.

i don't really use the CW front page as i usually come to CW articles from a link on reddit or slashdot so this is perfect for me. If you use CW a lot i wouldn't recommend this style.

i am i wee bit drunk right now and i wrote this quick just to read an article (CW is really messed up), i will clean it up when i get less drunk (:
