### Description
THE HEXES USED IN THIS THEME ARE FROM AND INSPIRED BY A REDDIT SYNC THEME BY /u/dudinacas. YOU CAN SEE THE THREAD HERE: https://redd.it/6fjms0. 

ALSO NOTE THAT THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH THE UPCOMING REDESIGN. I WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS FOR LEGACY USERS THOUGH.

I originally gave up making this theme when I deleted my old reddit account, but decided to keep working on it after I realized that I prefer this color pallet over the actual RES Dark Theme color.

I recommend turning on  autoColorUsernames in RES (under https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#res:settings/userHighlight), and checking "Random color, not too bright, consistent for each user) just for aesthetics.
