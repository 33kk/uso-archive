### Description
Adds the title if the Firefox app button is displayed. This is a personal style based on style 41025 by user 15980, primarily aimed for a Windows 7 non-persona user. Caption is also visible in maximized window mode. Doesn't work with tabs in title bar.

### Update notes
All the credit goes to user 15980. I didn't like a few things so I created this style.
