### Description
This style works on removing nearly every single ad, login and other textual information and focuses solely on uploading an image and getting the link to host it. It's nice and compact, and won't take up any unnecessary space.

I've been using this for a while and it should work well for many people. Even the gallery view is laid out well, making it look more fluid even though it's in tabular form.

v2: Fixed a small cosmetic change in the navigation by removing a link. (May 3rd)
