### Description
It's based on style 93 style 1528 style 1544 and style 440 with some tweaks by me. del.icio.us layout becomes more clear and readability is improved.

EDIT (3 June 2007)
Some more tweaks so the layout is more consistent. 
Most important change is making unbundled tags (in bundle tags settings) to be displayed green so you can see them easily
The frontpage still needs some improvements...
