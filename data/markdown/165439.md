### Description
!!!!FOR THE TIME BEING, I WON'T BE UPDATING THE STYLE. I'VE CHANGED A FEW LINES, BUT FAR FROM DONE!!!


Yet another dark theme for Duolingo. Still in the works.

Let me know if something needs update or you want changed.

PS: I'm a total noob when it comes to CSS, so the code is most likely full of redundancies.

I've "borrowed" a few lines (just for the loading circles) from Duolingo True Dark by el vper and I say borrowed since I couldn't find a way to contact him to ask for permission. If someone does find a way to contact him, please let me know so I don't just use his work without asking.
