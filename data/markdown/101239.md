### Description
original work by http://tanjihay.deviantart.com/art/Foxdie-15-60350715

Applies foxdie theme's tabs style and a few other things to the firefox 29+ on mac os x. Not works on windows and probably not works on linux either. Rest of the default firefox theme on os x fits well with this style but it would be incomplete and inconsisted even if it works on windows and linux. 

Works when tabs in titlebar too but there may be some glitches. Pinned tabs also not working when tabs overflow. 

There might be more glitches/bugs. etc. but haven't seen yet.

no retina support sorry.

btw if you want to hide australis menu button add this;


#PanelUI-menu-button {
    display: none;
}

24/07/2014: fixed back/forward button for firefox 31.0+

07/09/2014: temporary fix for firefox 32.0+. Tabs in titlebar mode not working right now, will looking for the fix it...

13/04/2015: fixed for firefox 37.0

07/04/2015: fixed for firefox 39.0
