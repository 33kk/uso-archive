### Description
Increase your vertical space by turning your tabs-on-top into tabs-in-titlebar.

NOTE: This style is intended for nightly testers.
Tested with Firefox 4 beta 6 nightly on Windows 7 Aero. May not be compatible with final version.


The draggable areas in a normal window are below the app button and below the window controls. In a maximized window, the absolute top of the window becomes draggable.
