### Description
I've downloaded the other CR styles by these talented guys and they look good, but I have an itchy finger syndrome. In this style, the colors are changed with an intention to look easy on the eyes, nothing overly bright/contrasting, but also have variety with color usage. Pink is used as a majority, with teal to balance out the feel. The colours of a rose was used as a rough guide, but overall, it is a rather feminine style. When I get plenty of time, I'll probably experiment with other colours, zen/bohemian, and more.

(CSS was edited from the Dark Grey style, apart from the obvious colour change, the format remains as before.)
