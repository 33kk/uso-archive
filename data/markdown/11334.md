### Description
Orange.fr webmail is useless on some Firefox3 version with an invisible 'Join" Button.
Added a position adjustment to Orange webmail CSS to make a button appear when one wants to join a file to an Email. 
Note that the "no-ad" portion of the code is mundows's "Orange Sans Pub" from http://userstyles.org/styles/7846, and he desserves all the credits for that. I started with his CSS as this is my first one on userstyles.org.
Note that I may add more adjustments if needed.

2008-10-18: Edited to work on various dynamic Orange URLs.
