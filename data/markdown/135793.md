### Description
A darker, slimmer version of Habitica, made to look easier on the eyes and less cluttered. The main theme colour can be selected by you! The entire Habitica website has been modified, not just the app. Constantly kept up to date! This theme is built upon 'merfy's HabitRPG'.

### Update notes
