### Description
For a website that was developed by WolfKodi - https://wolfkodi.dyndns.org/wolfing/
<br>
Better Darking uses the Dark Mode codes of Wolfing and in simplicity, darkens everything.
This is for the users who want a much darker tone to allow them to use the website when it's dark in their environment.
