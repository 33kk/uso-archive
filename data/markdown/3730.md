### Description
NEW version : http://userstyles.org/styles/6473

this style is powered by -moz-column-width and -moz-column-gap and possibly won't work with other browser than Firefox
Tested only on Firefox 3 (Minefield 3.0a)

DESIGNED to have 500px wide columns. on 1600x1200 there will be 3 columns

Extras:
* You could have exact numbers of columns by replacing line "-moz-column-width: 500px !important;" with "-moz-column-count: 3;" of course you can change the 3 with your desired number of columns
* If you want 'super tight' results remove ',span[class=a]' from the 3rd line from the end [that will make URL inline also copy and similiar links]

Supported domains are:
google.com
google.pl
