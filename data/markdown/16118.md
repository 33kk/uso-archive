### Description
An adaption of the style of the old Freefall-forum at nice.purrsia.com to the new forum.
* Provides the traditional background-colors.
* Compatible with new style-elements such as round corners of boxes and panels.

Updates: (1) the first version messed up the print-view for the Freefall-forum and that problem has been fixed; (2) proper anti-aliasing using a semi-transparent png for the quote-mark image; (3) the color of the dashed separator above notes about edited posts is set to black; (4) the lines of the code that affected all forums at nice.purrsia.com are now removed because their effects have been implemented in the web-site's own style sheets; and (5) setting of "max-with" instead of "width" for the forum logo to avoid temporary magnification of the logo while the page is loading.
