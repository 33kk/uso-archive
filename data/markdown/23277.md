### Description
***Made for the ChromeStylist extension, so may not work in other browsers***

This style was made by altering wolfreak_99's "Omegle - Black" code. I've used DaedalusIcarusHelios's background from his or her "Dark Shiny Blue, Transparency" style series.
Specific changes:
~ Altered Omegle's logo
~ The "Talk to strangers!" image is gone
~ Changed colors of "You:", "Stranger:", and the normal text.
~ Removed all borders
