### Description
For this style to work you need:

*  Firefox
*  'Greasemonkey' extension for firefox
*  'Stylish' extension for firefox

After getting these do the following:
1:  install this greasemonkey script (lastfm_xerion_layout.user.js) http://lastfm.xerionslair.org/scripts/lastfm_xerion_layout.user.js
2: install this style (only changes user pages) http://userstyles.org/styles/9064/
UPDATE: 
3: also install this style: http://userstyles.org/styles/9065 (it will change every other page except for user pages)

All credit for this style goes to the last.fm user Xerion, all i did was make it work on user profiles only (cause it was messing the rest of last.fm up) and uploading it here.
