### Description
Removes the Com-center/friend list bar that is always on the right if the battlelog. It is particularly annoying and useless when editing emblems.
I also attempted to hide the migration notice that spams reminders in the battlelog emblem editor about the BF1 companion editor.

I put a lot of time into editing emblems, and it ends up getting in the way of the work space.
I'm just a emblem maker and I'm a complete novice at coding, but I'm glad I've sorta figured out this code... (I hope) :3
