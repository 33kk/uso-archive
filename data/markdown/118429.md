### Description
This isn't a reversion back to the old layout tumblr had, it just makes the new layout more tolerable.
<ul>
<li>Removes avatar icons and hides the urls of reblog captions. You can hover over the caption to show the url.</li>
<li>Reblog captions are darker than the OP caption, providing differentiation between the OP and reblogs that the new layout does not.</li>
<li>New captions are marked on the left with a blue line.</li>
</ul>

### Update notes
<strong>UPDATE (Sep 5 2015 21:32 PST)</strong>
I fixed some of the things that made Firefox not work with this style. Message me through my <a href="http://www.pencels.tumblr.com/">tumblr ask</a> if you're a Firefox user and find any other problems!

<strong>UPDATE (Sep 5 2015 12:00 PST)</strong>
Images in reblog captions no longer take up the full width of the post.
Also added options:
<ul>
<li>Show avatar icons or remove them.</li>
<li>Show names always or only on hover.</li>
<li>Constant or alternate background color of posts. (By changing the background colors to different settings.)</li>
<li>Edit border thickness and color between reblogs.</li>
</ul>
