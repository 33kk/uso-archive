### Description
Changes the Nukapedia wiki to look a bit more like The Vault wiki, including background changes, as well as a new logo from the logo submission contest.

These changes were designed around and should be used in conjunction with <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/39977/cleaner-wikia">Cleaner Wikia</a> and the greasemonkey script linked on that page.
