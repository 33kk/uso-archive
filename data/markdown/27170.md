### Description
This is just some small tweaks to the new very ugly style on YouTube. Nothing extraordinary, and probably something some people won't like, but I think this is better than what they have now.

Changes are:
- the freaking ugly grey-ish background on the videos is replaced with a black background that blends itself with the player (wide mode only, small screen mode is disabled to prevent glitches).
- the + button on video thumbs when searching now appear only on mouse-hover.
- comment textarea is now a bit less ugly.
- comments are now separated by lines.
- comment date is always visible now.
- related videos have a grey background to make them standout on the page and not kill you with the mess the default style is
- related videos are now scrollable instead of stretching the whole page. Sidebar is fully functioning with collapsible sections, where available.
- improved comment section differentiation.
- comments now are show in the full width of their area, and the on-mouse-hover buttons overlap with it.
- improved YouTube logo (color wise).

Known bugs:
- currently, clicking the Disco button, when available, will provoke a serious glitch. I don't know how to fix it, but anyone's more than welcome to submit the code here if they find a way to.

I'm sorry there are no screen shots, but you can preview the style easily. I hope SOMEBODY finds this useful.
