(Screenshot fixed)

### Update notes
Goodnight, sweet prince. Goodnight, justin.tv...

Some features require and/or are only available in webkit (Chrome) , therefore some browsers will not all of the features. This style is made specifically for Google Chrome. This theme is not 100% complete, so don't be surprised if some parts of the site look different than the theme.

Please, if you can, post any bugs or non-styled areas of the site that you believe should be changed to fit the theme.

Looks like Justin has their own midnight theme now too, however that will not keep me from updating this theme for those that want it.

If you like this theme please rate it!
