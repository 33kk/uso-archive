### Description
This script is designed for dark themes for Firefox & Windows but it works with any theme.
It solves a common problem with dark themes when the text becomes invisible against white background.
Once installed, the background to all Text-boxes becomes gray, slightly lighter gray border & light gray text.
The gray background works also with black text so it makes sure the text will be always visible.
