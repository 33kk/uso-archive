### Description
My new dashboard for the upcomming PSP videogame and anime Black Rock Shooter. After watching the amazing OVA I became oobsessed!

I had to merge and edit some original artwork to create the background and make a photoshop brush of the official logo for the game to put it instead of the Tumblr logo. I’m still struggling with some css code but I’m almost finished.

If you want the City Icons by ohaixo, you must install them from here:

Looks best with 1024 × 768
