### Description
Current Version: Dragoneer Still Isn't Here (1.0, 10 January 2012)

After almost a year of sleeping, I've finally updated my sheet.

Colors have been changed to Dark Glass standard. Neon is as dead to me as Alexx BBY is now (jk bby iluvu), and I've removed all alternative options because I'm mean like that.

The only reason it's not named dark glass is to give some attention to it. Not to mention I kind of miss darkheart <3 . We needed a palette for our work, so I sorta' sold myself a bit cheaply there. So it goes.

At any rate, enjoy!
