### Description
NOTE, THIS IS FOR THE OLD VERSION OF FACEBOOK. IT WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY ON THE NEW VERSION.
in fact, it will look pretty terrible.
use this for the new version:
style 9711


Seen this style?
style 4876:  


Well, this has a similar feel.

Transparencys! darkness! original pictures and such! it's awesome!

The adds are removed, both facebook sponsored in the minifeed and the ones on the side.

This is the beta, so there will be fixes for hard to see text and such.  I wouldnt expect any drastic changes from this point, just several 
improvements.


Please note, this uses alot of PNG semitransparency things.
In other words, it might not work well at all on old browsers.  If you have one of the relatively knew versions of firefox, you should be good.
