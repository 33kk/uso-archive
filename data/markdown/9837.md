### Description
It was bound to happen.  City TV has been corrupted by the corporatist agenda.  Take back control of that-which-enters-your-eyes with this fantastic reformatting user style.  Bonus features include: removing the useless footer (which contains the evil Rogers logo), taking out the banner, a general widening feeling, and so forth.

It also changes a background image so that it is a bit more stylish.
