### Description
Affects the appearance of the browser-based RPG Kingdom of Loathing (KoL).
Created using code from user 911's style 2344. 
If you use any of her other KoL skins, this will not override [much of] it, 
although you may desire to change some of the colors in this style for aesthetic purposes.

My name on Kingdom of Loathing is PlastikManiac, the same as my user name here. 
Feel free to contact me in-game about this userstyle; I'd love to hear any feedback.
