### Description
Clean up Medium (including Hacker Noon and other websites using Medium blog system), make the height of their pages' readable area comfortably larger by removing the post meter bar, open in app and upgrade membership notifications, the footer and other annoying parts, as well as reducing the header of the blog pages and making the metabar scrollable.

Note that popped up notification is hidden, therefore if you want to signup / sign in to Medium, you must <strong>middle click the "Become a member / Sign in / etc." button</strong> to do that.
