### Description
<strong>TODOIST ADVANCED </strong>is the original and best-supported dark/custom skin generator for Todoist. It's been tested on the Todoist platform up to <strong>version 978</strong>. Latest mod: customizable motivational tagline, tag font color and logo color options!

Todoist Advanced offers a fully integrated and optimised dark theme with many additional configuration options should you wish to add your own styling. To change the main colours, switch skins to OFF and choose your colours from the MAIN COLORS etc. 

The default install of Midnight has priority left-border enabled, 4 priority colors (RYBG), default label (circle - transparent), wide screen, edge shadows, custom scrollbars (new), and the Carto texture.

If you need any new settings, let me know.  Hit 'Customize Settings' above to access your style goodies.

USEFUL TIPS & IMPORTANT INFO

Given the recent changes in Todoist styling, I've decided to minimise the work in updating the stylesheet by removing all themes other than Midnight. I'll leave a few extra options on accessory stylings, but I'm going to streamline the options. 

If you want to use the Stalemate font for the motivational tagline, then just remove the /*...*/ from the @import for the Google font, or install the free font yourself. 

The top-bar icons can be made dark by choosing Neutral or light by choosing Noir in the normal Todoist theme settings. Noir works well for dark skins, while Neutral is required for Karma Gold's customized top bar. 

The 'alpha background color' is the color behind semi-transparent 'alpha' page textures. There are alpha color presets available that match each skin, but you can also mix and match these to different skins, headers, and alpha textures etc. Note: Branagh texture works best for Silver skin.

You can use Todoist Advanced on Android devices. The STYLISH or STYLUS addons can be used on the mobile Firefox browser. However, to install the style, you must select 'load desktop site' version from the browser's menu. 

If you ever have a problem with Todoist Advanced, check back here for an update (or through your addon) or if it doesn't fix your problem, post a comment. I will usually fix the problem within a day or two.

CHANGELOG (6-months):

25.11.2019 Been busy the last few days. Big strip down of the old themes. Going to work with just the one dark theme, since the constant changes are difficult to maintain on all the skins at the same time, and I've no indication that people are using anything other than the dark theme. I fixed the priority labels down into the various new menus that Todoist have been adding. Only the user-defined colours to sort out. 

13.11.2019 Some new menus added by Todoist, and more SVG priority labels buried in the menus. Though the colours are now showing correctly on Midnight, there are some glitches with changing priorities from inside popups. So, use the main menu (hamburger far right). Lots of tidying following some removal by Todoist of legacy code. Widths fixed and realignments of menus. Should look tidier now. Let me know about any outstanding issues that I've missed.  

30.03.2019 Reverted some  color changes on default TA theme after Todoist made some class name changes. Tweaked checkbox position. 

28.11.2018 Added Logo color and tagline font color options. 

20.11.2018 Added a customizable motivational tagline. I've used arial for the default, but if you have Stalemate, a free Google font, on your computer, give that option a whirl.  

10.10.2018 Added a border radius option to priority left border. Just a small styling tweak.

09.10.2018 Fixed yet another SVG change they've made. Now when editing a task, the priority label indicator will be a neutral grey until you click it, at which point you will see your priority colors and your current selection.  

03.10.2018 Added a narrow browser screen view capability, if you need to have a browser window open at the edge of your screen. Thanks Mamta for the feeedback. I fixed a few more icons that have switched to SGV and a few hover settings on the dark themes. Fixed calendars showing dark text on dark background.

20.09.2018 Yesterday I added a new color setting to the priority labels, Purple-Red-Yellow-Blue, to overcome a small conflict for a users settings. Today I adjusted a setting for positioning the filter icons. As ever, thanks for the feedback on problems. 

17.08.2018 Fixed some issues on the Rainbow SKIN. 

25.07.2018 Thanks to SlyFox and JamieMartin for pointing out the white boxes in left menu after a recent update. Todoist Advanced has also been updated. Also fixed the rather bright fonts on Midnight, both in Left Menu and Descriptions. 

10.07.2018 Improved the font size settings, added 'font - body text' setting for task descriptions. Renamed 'main' to 'left menu' to be more accurate. Fixed colours on background box for 'delete account'.

06.07.2018 Fixed the priority label flag colors not matching with priority labels. Todoist recently replaced .png files with SVG. These have now been updated to correspond to your chosen label color schemes. 

The User-defined option for  Priority Label colors has been simplified to just one setting. This now assumes control for left-border colors too, which previously had to be set to user-defined separately. As a consequence, left-border is fixed to ON for user-defined colors.

13.05.2018 Added code to maintain indenting when editing task. Thanks to Jordan for the tip and the code. 

24.03.2018 Thanks for feedback on the 'actions' icon jumping under certain views. Fixed. 

21.03.2018 Added custom scrollbars - no more white scrollbars on dark themes. You can both width and color or just go with the default ON. Default ON is RED! Tweaked arrow positions after Todoist also tweaked. Fixed filter handlers on dark themes not having invert (not bright enough).

21.03.2018 Renamed the Dusky skin to Earth, following the recent colours revamp. Keys remain the same name, so you won't have to reset anything. Also modified the hover and active right-margins on the top list (left menu) to better match the project style settings. This was on dark themes. Fixed the Karma Gold top bar customization to work on all Todoist 'themes', though Todoist's Neutral theme gives dark icons. 

19.03.2018 Thanks Henry Marshall for heads up and suggested fix for inline code ?. Modified how Projects/Filters/Labels open in dark themes. No borders, but box shadow glow indicates an open section. Added a little bit more width to the left_menu in Wide format. Fixed 'normal' width. Changed border priority size to slightly thinner - looks like Todoist have been messing with some of their global values.  

16.03.2018 Modified dark themes to reflect new Todoist update to Projects, Labels and Filters. Todoist removed the tabbed sections.

13.03.2018 Improved the legibility of shortcuts on the help screen for due date shortcodes on dark themes.

01.03.2018 Gave Dusky a bit more earthy look, since it was a little too similar to Midnight.  Added a little bit of brightness to the drag and drop handler on dark themes. Also added -webkit-filter settings for Firefox to a few instances where they'd been left out, again, improving brightness of some elements on dark themes. Tweaked the position of drag and drop handlers too.  

24.02.2018 Added a 'trim' page shadow option. It's a thin shadowed line, in contrast to the other shadows that are larger shadows without a trim. 

08.02.2018 Fixed 'selected' background color for filters on dark themes.

07.02.2018 Fixed the drop-down menu for project allocations on dark themes. 

18.01.2018 A couple of small fixes on the dark themes - an annoying white border on the priority label div, and fixed white rollover on settings menu.
