### Description
I wanted a scrollbar that I could actually see against a bright background, instead of the Windows 8 scrollbar that Firefox uses on my comp.
This is actually a modification of Firefox - Simple Scrollbars by m1n1f1g found here: http://userstyles.org/styles/46044/firefox-simple-scrollbars
My version keeps the arrows at top and bottom, and keeps the default scrollbar width.
