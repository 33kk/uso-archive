### Description
Replacement for the new EQ2 Forums Style. Gets rid of the Parchment and strange category strips. Fixes a lot of CSS issues, tightens things up, and draws more attention to buttons/clickable links. Better use of Sans-serif fonts. Unread threads are more visible. Signatures are no longer squished. Quotes are a lot easier to read. This is still a dark-on-light background theme. A light-on-dark theme will require an incredible amount of work to recolor every font on the site.
