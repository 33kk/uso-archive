### Description
Facebook redesign. Gone are related pages, the entire right column. The timeline is expanded and all fonts are beautiful, rendered with ClearType.

### Update notes
<b>Compatibility: </b>For Facebook design active on December 28, 2014.

<b>Update: </b> On December 28, 2014, the author decided that the white from the sidebar should be removed. Now, the bar looks a bit more like Facebook's default. This behavior is intended and the style screenshot was updated.
