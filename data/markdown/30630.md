### Description
UPDATED FOR 2012!

The current style (2012-06-08) of the ebuyer.com site means that the product listings take up quite a lot of space, making it harder to compare products and forcing you to scroll more than you need to.

Images are out of date, but it has a similar effect — more things visible vertically!
