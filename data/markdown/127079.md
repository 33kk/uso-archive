### Description
<b>GMX</b> is a German based webmail service that is popular among both German and English speakers. After acquiring the French email provider <b>Caramail</b>, they have welcomed many French users as well. Unfortunately, the design of the website has since deteriorated to the point where using it is an almost insufferable experience. Install this simple stylesheet and you can enjoy reading your email once more!
