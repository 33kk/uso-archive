### Description
This is meant to hide the Google username for all Google sites (personalized Google, Gmail, Google calendar, Google News, etc).  If you do not want the username to disappear entirely, or add back altered content, simply replace "display:none !important;" with the one of the options seen at the bottom of the CSS code.

Inspired by style 425.  Please make sure to check that style for further options.
