### Description
Thunderbird: Resize the Calendar Toolbar and the Tasks Toolbar in Thunderbird. Both (which occupy the same position and shape... but exist on different TB tabs) are overly large in my opinion, and thus here is a way to shrink them smaller. You probably won't have a calendar toolbar though unless you have first installed the Lightning addon (calendar).
