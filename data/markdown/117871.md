### Description
Won't get rid of the redirect page, the email requirement, bring back subscribed numbers on quarantined subs, or completely restore the original CSS, but it will remove the god-ugly yellow "Quarantined" box next to comments and posts, the "leave community" and the disclaimer box above the subscribe buttons, and the yellow icon.
