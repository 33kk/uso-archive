### Description
This style will narrow the width of forum discussions and slightly increase the font size and line spacing all for easier reading (especially if you have a wide screen monitor).  It also highlights the second level posts in a discussion.  This is useful for situations where the first level post is the assignment itself posted by the professor, and the second level posts are the student responses.  Third level and deeper posts do not include this highlighting, making it easier to scroll through entire discussions and find the beginning of the next one.

I'm assuming this will work with any moodle site, you would just need to change the domain that it is applied to.
