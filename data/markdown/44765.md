### Description
I don't suppose that there are many people who use both userstyles.org and the (dodgily-named) homework website yacapaca.com, but I hope there are a few. Anyway, this style cleans up the student todolist, changing a few elements and hiding unnecessary logos and similar. It also makes the page fit on many screens, without needing to scroll. By the way, this is ONLY TESTED IN CHROME, although FIREFOX IS PROBABLY SUPPORTED. I have added an option below (generally yes for FF, no for non-FF and FF4).

### Update notes
1.1: Added screenshots. Rounded corners of hovered rows. Cleaned up CSS.
