### Description
In January 2019, Etsy updated their forums and teams. Unfortunately this was difficult to use for promotions! But if you install this style, you can promote your shop just like before! The style looks almost exactly the same as the old Etsy Forums!

How to install:
1. Install Stylish plugin for Firefox or Chrome
2. Install this style

That's it! Have fun promoting!
