### Description
I combined a lot of the code I found on here and then made my own tweaks.

1) moves "feeds" to the right
2) makes the menu/task bar transparent.

Simple.  Makes it look like a version of older facebook that has some new flair. I am not claiming any of this as my own, I just put it up here to save others some time.

Basically the same as the other just no scroll, I actually like the Highlights. Go figure. :p
