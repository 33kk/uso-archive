### Description
Replaces the default toolbar button icon of "Back to Close" add-on by Christopher McGarry (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/9793) with a base64 hard-coded red icon with back button style.

The height of small toolbar is not affected by the presence of the "Back to Close" button.
When hovering or clicking the close button, its icon changes accordingly.

*** UPDATE - 25/02/2009 ***
Pushed close together the two arrows forming the close cross to improve button appearance.

*** UPDATE - 01/03/2009 ***
Integrated style 15314.
Removed the #forward-button[disabled="true"] block so that now the two buttons have always the same width.

*** UPDATE - 21/04/2009 ***
Fixed nav-bar height to 38px to prevent it to increase of 1px when displaying back-to-close-button instead of back-button (this issue appeared in the Linux version of the browser).
This trick prevents also the toolbar to be too high in the first instants after browser startup when other toolbar items are not visible (Windows version issue - killed two birds with one stone!).
Set nav-bar[iconsize="small"] height to 24px to prevent it being 38px.

*** DEVELOPERS NOTE ***
For some reason, the "list-style-image" technique (more proper, I think) doesn't work very well on my environment: sometimes the new icon simply disappears. This happens also concerning my style 15502. Does anybody hazard a guess?

Tested with Firefox 3 (both on Linux and Windows), with "Kde4 + Firefox3" theme by Ramon Antonio Parada (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/7574) only.
