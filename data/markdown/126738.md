### Description
This style moves the text and buttons in the Adventure page of Aywas into separate columns so as to prevent the "Continue Exploring" button from jumping up and down based on how much text is above it. It also shortens very long buttons by trailing them off into ellipses, as well as centers and enlarges the "Click here to access your battle" button, along with some other minor visual improvements.

Currently only tested in Chrome (OS X) and Safari (OS X), but should theoretically work in any modern browser.
