### Description
Userstyle for bundle addicts.

Have trouble seeing which tags aren't bundled? Not any more, this alters the bundle page so that unbundled tags are easier to see by making them bold and blue. It also knocks back tags that belong to other bundles in to the background by changing them to grey.
