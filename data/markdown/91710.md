"<i>A nebula is an interstellar cloud in outer space that is made up of dust, hydrogen and helium gas, and gryphons. It is formed when portions of the interstellar medium collapse and clump together due to the gravitational attraction of the particles that comprise them.</i>" <sup><a href="http://www.universetoday.com/61103/what-is-a-nebula/">*</a></sup>
