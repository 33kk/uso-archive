### Description
Based on the previous windows 10 Dark with some snippets of code from the Windows 10 Edge themes to fix a bug.

Since the orignal author of Dark 10 seems to not respond or update, i hacked together a fix for the minimize, close and maximize buttons.

Note: I have NO IDEA what I'am doing, and will probably not reply to any requests or bugs or whatnots people post here... :(
