### Description
Want a house hippo? A puny panda? A wee wolf? Shrink your pets with this style and party like it's April Fools 2018!

### Update notes
I wanted to try to make this such that it didn't apply to aether mounts (so the aether mount would still raise you up), but I couldn't find a way around it.

I've tested it just a little but it seems to work fine. It uses code directly from the April Fools update with a few modifications where it wasn't quite working right in my testing.

It includes an option to shrink the pawprints as well. This is ON by default.
