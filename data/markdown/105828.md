### Description
Ever think to yourself "Man, I wish I had a poorly made custom skin for PS! that's based on a picture of Sonic the Hedgehog that was drawn by an autistic kid a couple years ago!"?

Well this is the style for you!

This style borrows the battle room style and lobby chat style from the kalos style (https://userstyles.org/styles/101626/kalos-theme-x-y-style-pokemon-showdown) and also changes the background and color scheme to one based around sanic hegehog.

It also makes the font in the lobby chat bold and does all kinds of other unnecessary things I'm probably not going to bother fixing.  

GOTTAGOFAST!
