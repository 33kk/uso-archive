To see food info only use http://userstyles.org/styles/14326

Using them both at the same time may cause problems.

Colours:

Red: Reserved for weapons when they are added
Orange: Armour till I find something better, doesn't look good over grey items.
Yellow: Raw food so as to be consistent to Ciaran's script
Cyan: Food for consistence.
Green: Seeds
