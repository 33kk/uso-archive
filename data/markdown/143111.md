### Description
Style customization for the "Note Anywhere" Chrome extension.

Makes the sticky notes adapt its size to its content.
Minimum dimensions are configurable.

Allows, as well, to select the font family and size, which the extension fails to save on its configuration menu, for the content and footer separately.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to add units to your dimensions (px).

Restrictions:
- Still haven't managed to figure out why but minimum heights lower than 210px will be ignored.
