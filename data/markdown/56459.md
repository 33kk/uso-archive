### Description
Adjusts the text and image sizes in the VDS Homepage "Information Feed".

The focus of this adjustment is to highlight critical information. It is similar to the Info Feed on the "Ancestral Chamber" sanctum. 
Applying this skin reduces the font size, changes the font, reduces the size of all emotes and images (for clutter), but increases the font size for log times.
