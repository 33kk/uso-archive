### Description
For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This style hides redundant(useless) toolbar button drop-markers, those by pressing the drop-marker would give you the same toolbar button Action(Ex: Menu popup) if you either left/right-clicked the toolbar button's icon.

Works well with userstyles:
style 41232
style 51113
style 60114

Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora and Nightly builds.

To customize or fix Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds, you can also have a look at my other styles: user 61655
