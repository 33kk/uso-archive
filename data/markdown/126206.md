### Description
This style is designed to be used with the Simple White X theme (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simplewhitex/). It gives you a colored Titlebar on Windows 10 if you have the option to show accent color on start menu/taskbar/action center/titlebar enabled.

Note: Due to how the Min/Max/Close buttons are drawn this will probably only work properly with 100% DPI

### Update notes
Credit to AdmiralSpeedy @ WinAero for the base userstyle

IF YOUR WINDOWS TITLEBAR COLOR IS DARK, SELECT THE DARK VARIANT AS THIS WILL MAKE THE TAB OVERFLOW/TAB MENU DROPDOWN BUTTONS WHITE

OTHERWISE IF YOU USE A LIGHT TITLEBAR COLOR USE THE LIGHT VARIANT, THIS WILL MAKE THE TAB OVERFLOW/TAB MENU ICONS DARK (see the additional screenshots for examples, the userstyle is otherwise universally compatible with both light dark titlebars)

11/16/16 - Fixed issue with tab overflow arrow (the arrow to scroll right in tab overflow was pointing wrong direction)

11/21/16 - Added padding to Close button when window was maximized to fix issue where if you put your mouse on the upper right of maximized window it wasn't hovering the close window button

11/21/16 - Removed annoying 3px space above tab bar (this section is commented in the css, remove it if you want the gap)
