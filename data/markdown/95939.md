### Description
This is an adaptation of <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/group/198799/fimfiction-userscripts/thread/66098/remove-obnoxious-items">Remove Obnoxious Items</a> by waterpear.

It removes or collapses elements which take up too much room on small screens.

### Update notes
<ul>
<li>I don't actively use this script myself, so <b>tell me immediately if something breaks.</b></li>
<li>I couldn't find a GIF to test with, so it's possible the GIF hiding is broken.</li>
<li>Because of how YouTube embeds work, the "Hover-Expand" option won't let you interact with the video after you've clicked play the first time. (Because clicking "Play" swaps in a Flash applet)</li>
<li>Got any more things that you think should be collapsed? Let me know.</li>
</ul>
