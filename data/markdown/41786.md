### Description
Simply a port of a user script (with a few tiny CSS errors fixed).

original: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/70345

Reason for the port is having the default theme appear until the page is fully loaded sucks.



(if the original author wants me to remove this so that they can upload their own version, for updates or whatever, msg me)
