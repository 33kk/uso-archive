### Description
there was a lack of aradia themes so i made one. it was originally just for me but other people liked it too!

there's a little god tier aradia in the top left corner and some random red lines so it isn't boring. over on the right side it says; 

"AA: i am very much alive
AA" and i intend to stay that way :)"

i use google chrome, but i don't know how it'll look on other browsers. i'm not really all that good at coding so..

ALSO THE tumut banner is part of the theme but it's really easy to change..
