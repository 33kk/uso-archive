### Description
Based on "Slashdot Cleanup" by darkphoenix22.

Like "Slashdot Cleanup" this CSS removes the left sidebar and makes the header scrollable. The key difference is that the slashboxes remain on the right for those who like them. However, the syndication icons which normally appear in the slashbox section have been removed.

This style also adds a more aggressive indentation to user comments. This makes the comment tree easier to read.
