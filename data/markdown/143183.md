### Description
A nice wooden theme for use on Roll20, the only pen and paper virtual tabletop. It was created first for The One Ring RPG, one of the best tabletop RPG System. I use the theme created by StuartJ and remove the ring. It was only a small change but I made the change public so my players and others can use it.
