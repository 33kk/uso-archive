### Description
Hey. To me, as well as to you, sometimes don't like some elements on a site and my small style just is engaged in that corrects CSS and does a site more pleasantly(removes ad blocks, aggressive content and etc).
<b>Important!</b> This is my personal opinion and all the changes are made to own taste and color.

Please let me know if there are annoying elements on your favorite site and standard blocking methods don't work.
