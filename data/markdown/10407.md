### Description
Many websites make use of access keys to help power users do things quicker and reduce the amount of back-and-forth between keyboard and mouse. These shortcuts are different from site to site, and it can take a while to remember them. Additionally, websites don't usually go out of the way to advertise their use of access keys.

Enter this stylesheet, which places a high-contrast box next to page elements that specify access keys.
