### Description
Hide some parts of Facebook that I think unimportant, like Ads, friend or group suggestions, home link on the upper right, news ticker, and not-favorited groups/lists/apps.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: "<strong>Favorite</strong>" your Facebook apps/pages/groups <strong><em>if you don't want them to be hidden</em></strong> on the left column of Facebook. Do it before you activate this style.
