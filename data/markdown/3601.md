### Description
With the latest run of Google Reader updates, I noticed that when I removed the sidebar using the toggle button between the sidebar and the main screen - I would get the scrollbar pushed out of the browser.  Looking around for a fix - I found out if you removed the toggle between the menu and body of Google Reader it would fix the problem.  Hopefully this is only a temp. fix till Google gets things corrected.  First public user style - so be nice. ;)
