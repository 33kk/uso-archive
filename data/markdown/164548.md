### Description
*NOTE 16/06* I know the new "emoji reaction" is broken, will update in a few days.

Condensed mode for Microsoft Teams: Use full screen width; remove timestamp headers on each message; remove alternating left/right display of messages; replace avatar by textual name; reduce margins/paddings.

Doubles the number of messages displayed.

This customization applies to the "Dark" theme of Microsoft Teams. See other styles from me for compact mode and light themes.
