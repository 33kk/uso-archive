### Description
I was unhappy with the new Gmail and tried  'The Return of the Old Gmail' by Techably. After using that style I decided to try modifying it a bit to reduce contrast. The result was 'Gmail Bland'. 

While it looks nothing like the old Gmail, I realized some of the appeal behind the old Gmail had to do with softer color combinations that were much easier on the eyes. 'Gmail Bland' is simply a style that tries to eliminate harsh contrasts to make it easier to focus on content without being distracted by the garish and visually draining motif in the new Gmail.

Two things I was unable to alter include changing the red 'send' button to something less alarming as well as the black border in the chat box. Since I am not savvy with css and just used trial and error to modify Techably's style, I welcome and appreciate any modifications and advice to improve this style.
