### Description
Change last.fm website's style into a softer dark grey theme. 

You MUST use "paint it black" option to have an homogeneous style (so website account is required). It's quite a "beta" version, although I haven't noticed any trouble while using it, so if you've got any issue with it, don't hesitate to post it here.

***UPDATE 05/13/2010***
Some minor changes into charts pages, and a few changed borders to make the style prettier =).
