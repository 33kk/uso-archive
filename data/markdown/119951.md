### Description
Tabs are now squared as it should be. 
Tab bar & Tool bar are now lower in height, for the gain of visibility of the active window. 
Text content placement within the tab is optimized for maximum readability.
Removed the ugly Aero fog on the Tab bar and the "show all tabs" button.
Feels free to add any comment.

Compatible with new "compact" styles (that aren't so compact really) that Mozilla introduced with Firefox 53, both versions, Light and Dark. Colors in tab bar remains unchanged between styles.
