### Description
i was sick of all these FF4 statusbar mods that always covered my facebook chat it got rly annoying so i decided to make my own.

!!!BOTH SCREENSHOTS ARE AFTER!!!!

as you can see when you hover a link it will appear on the bottom right, yes this may cover facebook chat but if your not pointing to it whats it matter.
when you do point to facebook chat as you can see in the first image all you get is a # symbol which is calling the .js and this does not get in the way of facebook chat.

the addon bar will automatically adjust by how many apps you have on it i recommend getting
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1759/ Organize Statusbar to show/hide certain images from the statusbar.  yes this still works on ff4 b8pre ATM

leave some feedback and suggestions.
or if you straight up hate something about it let me know
one can only learn from mistakes and i love constructive criticism.

if you feel this mod is perfect for you why not donate something even 1 dollar is good and it will encourage me to keep releasing my mods.
