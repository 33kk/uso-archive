### Description
Screenshot here: http://ukcmp.com/td/midnight.jpg
Compare with default here: http://ukcmp.com/td/default.jpg

also, here is a screenshot of http://ukcmp.com/td/navytrim.jpg my other toodledo style (style 52315). Navy trim, unlike midnight, is only a slight modification of the tasks page.

Midnight is an example of a full color scheme for the new toodledo website. It is a good foundation for future theme creators can use to make their own themes (it is public domain, I don't copyrighting a color scheme is possible, anyway).

If you use this and like it, tell me! If you like this, but there's something missing or broken, let me know and I will fix it. If you have suggestions for a slightly different version, I might have the time but cannot promise anything.
