### Description
A Wikipedia skin that focuses on readability: Comfortable line-width, larger text, better typography, less visual noise, darkened colours. <br><br>

All menus are hidden by default: Move your mouse over to the left edge of your browser to bring back the navigation sidebar; move it up to the grey area on top to bring back the main article links.<br><br>

<b>New feature as of version v0.9.9: Hidden Table of Contents:</b> Move your mouse to the right edge of the browser window to show it. (And yes, i know, it's somewhat broken for smaller screens. I'm looking for a fix.)<br><br>

Note: This skin focuses on the English Wikipedia, with a few fixes for the German one. But it should be mostly fine in any language.<br><br>
