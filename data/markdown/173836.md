### Description
Get a little bit of the old "good" Twitter feeling back. Basically combine the best parts of the old layout with the best parts of the new application. Recently added support for dark and dim modes all in one.

Moved navigation to a top bar instead of left-side column, with better notification indicators in the menu, and an overall "tighter" appearance. A few less severe curves and "bubbles," and a gray background to frame your timeline. Plus some other modifications to clean things up. 

06-19-2020 - Fixed "new tweets" button cutoff. 
04-24-2020 - Fixed the profile thumbnail drop-down menu that was added recently. Fixed the top header bar positioning. 
08-21-2019 - Fixed sidebar search box positioning after the most recent update.
