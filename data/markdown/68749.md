### Description
Adds a neat auto-hide effect for the bookmarks toolbar that hovers over the page content instead of pushing it down. Also replaces the bookmark item's default rollover and hover states and tweaks the vertical spacing between them.

Works and looks best on OSX 10.5+ with Firefox 12 or higher. I have created a separate CSS for Windows users.

### Update notes
Version 1.0.0 - 7/04/12 - Initial version (Happy America Day!)
Version 1.0.1 - 7/06/12 - Tweaked animation timings.
Version 1.0.2 - 7/10/12 - Added setting for large or small browser icons.
