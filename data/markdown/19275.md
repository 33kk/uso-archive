### Description
Some readability improvements to the Game Design Concepts Aceboard, especially for widescreen monitors.

Edit: Realized I forgot to style the forms for posting.

There's some wonkiness with the headings I'm not sure how to fix. The site's HTML mostly uses inline styles, with occasional classes thrown in, so it's difficult to target specific blocks.
