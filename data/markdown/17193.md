### Description
It seems like there is a problem with the swedish version of Facebook that makes the "Applikationer" text at the bottom (on the Applications-button) just not show... This is a fix for that.
It works in Firefox on Mac, not sure about the rest... If it doesn't work for you, just increase the numbers "92px" and "5px" in the code a bit (make the same change to booth) and you will get it to work...
