### Description
UPDATE: 31/05/10

Wow, haven't checked UserStyles for a while; but pleased to see so many downloads! Unfortunately this theme is now 3 or 4 versions of Facebook out-of-date so won't work and I don't have any plans to update it, don't install.
------------------------------------------


Slight modification to the script originally written to hide Facebook Applications that people install on their profile which are generally unnecessary. Only difference is that App Icons are also hidden towards the top left of the page, lots of other Facebook Advertisements are hidden and the Videos Application is no longer hidden.

Thanks for downloading!
