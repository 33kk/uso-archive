### Description
Blurs out text and image messages inside conversations, the user names in the header and right sidebar, the profile pictures in the left sidebar, and the shared photos on the right sidebar. The blur is removed on hover. You can easily disable the blurring of a particular area if you don't like it, the code is commented for guidance.
