### Description
Basically makes the "Manual Ordering" list to look the same as the "Netflix Suggest".

If you don't know what it is, there is a hidden option to make 'My List' static and arrangeable through drag and drop.

You can change your settings following this link:

https://www.netflix.com/MyListOrder

Information about title, year, age rating and duration from the original manually-ordered list won't be display.

But Notes (for instance: until when a show will be available) will be shown.
