### Description
Classic retro theme for www.classic-retro-games.com for that 70 and 80s vibe. Clint from LGR would approve the more warm woody - brownish - colourscheme. And it's easy on the eyes too.

You can choose to include (default setting) or exclude ad-suppression. The website will detect ad-blockers and show a nag-screen instead, yet this suppression option allows you to not have the ads, nor the nag-screen displayed when enabled.  Or you can choose to disable the suppression to fully support the website.

The theme additionally fixes the cursor-pointer <b>not</b> changing when hovering links, as the website would suppress that behaviour, leaving the user possibly unaware it's hovering a clickable link/item ! With this theme the feedback is restored, for a better user-experience.
