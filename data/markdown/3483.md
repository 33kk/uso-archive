### Description
For use with the IJ Skins: Class Adder [ http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11289 ] Greasemonkey script - it won't work without it. Find Greasemonkey here [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 ].

Meant to be used with Hand, will look awful on others. Adapted from [http://userstyles.org/styles/3152] by furiosity. Another version is available without the banner or login that will work with other schemes.

[Edit Sept. 25, 07] I've noticed that if you use LJlogin's new version, which allows use on IJ, and you use it to regulate your browsing preferences (Hand, Tweak, etc.) strange things happen to the font size in the sidebar.  If this happens to you, just up the font size on these codes from 8px to 10px:

.sitescheme td.head {
        color: #000000 !important;
        border-bottom: solid 1px #000000 !important;
        background-color: #ffffff !important;
        font: 8px Verdana, Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif !important;
  } 

table.nav {
        font-size: 8px !important;
        color: #000000 !important;
}
