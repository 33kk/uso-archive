### Description
Cleans up the UI of Google SearchWiki results pages. Moves the promotion buttons out to a floated right position. This is for people who like SearchWiki, but want to reduce visual clutter some.

If you have any feedback, or suggestions for more tweaks, please let me know.

Enjoy!

*Update 11/24: removed the ad bar, which borked the floating buttons, cleaned up indented results
