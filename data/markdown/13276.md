### Description
Hide only the right-side of the bottom bar on all Facebook.com pages.  The right-side is where the chat and quick notifications features appear.

The bar is still displayed on the bottom of the screen, and everything that normally appears on the left-side still displays as per usual.

This style mod is ideal for users of the multiclient chat program Digsby.  Chat with your Facebook friends using Digsby's interface, and rid your browser of any annoying duplicate conversation slide-ups that appear on any open Facebook pages.
