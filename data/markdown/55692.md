### Description
Beautiful dashboard theme with black and grey damask background and hints of turquoise here and there. Also rounded profile images
Used style 39360 as the base for this theme.

You will need this code to fix the problem with comment/post sections not being visible. 
The damask background shows instead of just white, making it hard to type.
You can download that style here: style 55178
