### Description
I liked the font "facitweb" used on the PC World website however I did not like them using default system fonts in the main article or on some other places on the webpage. I tried to make the facitweb experience universal using this style sheet.

Please let me know if you have got any suggestions or if you can see different or system fonts being used in any corner of this website and I will try my best to edit the style sheet.
