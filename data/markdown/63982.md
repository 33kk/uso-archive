### Description
I tried(!) to get rid of the huge amount of whitespace in the new Google+ design and this is what I came up with. none of the other styles worked correctly so I made on very basic from scratch. The script simply widens the message boxes shown in the stream - nothing else! The form to post is still too small but I'll maybe update that later. No elements are hidden or moved.
