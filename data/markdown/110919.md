### Description
Replaces lame fonts like Arial and Verdana with Open Sans (or the font of your choice) on all websites, except on Google Drive. It also replaces Times New Roman with Tinos. Finally, it hides Stack Exchange Hot Network Questions and Hot Meta Posts.

### Update notes
If you don't have Open Sans installed, you'll get it remotely from Google, hopefully.

Currently, this script doesn't work on websites (like Wikipedia) that define their font as "sans-serif", in which case your browser uses its default sans serif font, which is typically Arial. You'll have to change your browser's default font settings for that.
