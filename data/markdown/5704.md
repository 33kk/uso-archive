### Description
For a long time, I found the default Greasemonkey icons to be hideously ugly, so I made my own in the style of 15x15 emoticons that we all know well.

You can also modify this style to change the toolbar button with your own custom icons!

### Update notes
Installing this style will replace the default statusbar and toolbar icons with my own.  Enjoy!

Last Update: V1.4 - 2011-09-05 - Now the sad face shows on the toolbar button when Greasemonkey is disabled in FF4+. Made legacy Firefox 3 support optional, to make style smaller.
