### Description
Makes userstyles.org look somewhat more like forum.userstyles.org (before the July 2014 update).

Subtitle: everything you never knew you always wanted in a style for userstyles.org (because, yeah--I get it: "unobtrusive" isn't usually the topmost goal when designing a theme; but that seems to be what the folks at VanillaForums.org were going for with their "Original Blue"--the more you use it, the more you seem to not notice it.)
