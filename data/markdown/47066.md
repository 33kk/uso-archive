### Description
drastically improves use of vertical space

2012.03.04 edit: also removed yuhead-com-links-conf

2012.06.17 edit: deleted (regional?) "us.mc1621." part of the applicable domain.  works the same.  don't know why i didn't think of that before.  this may be a fix for some of you who were saying this style didn't work.

2012.09.09 edit: even more vertical space claimed, removed ugly bottom border; cleaned/trimmed code a little, added option for different mepanel (hi, signout, help) l/r position if your monitor is a different size than mine
