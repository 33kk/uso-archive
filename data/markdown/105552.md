### Description
I was doing a quick rip off of the Tomorrow theme until someone beat me to it. Took what I did and prettied it up for me.

### Update notes
9/20/14
Added custom mascot support. Will add custom colors support when I'm not lazy.

9/19/14
Will do some subtle updates like changing some colors, messing with some of the padding and borders and maybe add mascots. The style is overall considered finish.
