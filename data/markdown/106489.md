### Description
<strong>I am officially discontinuing all my TweetDeck themes, so they may be outdated, but feel free to fork them (they now are into the public domain)!</strong>

This style needs to be used with the light theme of TweetDeck, otherwise it will be ugly !

Like <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/105965/light-tweetdeck-classic-aero">this one</a> but without the transparency effect at the top of the columns (now it's easier to scroll down to old tweets).
