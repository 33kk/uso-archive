### Description
Makes the Bible text column full width for esvbible.org, up to one App at a time.
At installation, you can optionally choose to "Hide" on "Footnote Visibility". The default is "Show" if you do not make a choice.

### Update notes
Limitations:
1. Only works with one App. Loading a second App causes website to open it as a pop-up.
2. Causes text overflow in Reader mode.
3. Footnote Visibility is toggled at style install only. To change it the style must be removed and reinstalled. This is a limitation of the Stylish extension.
