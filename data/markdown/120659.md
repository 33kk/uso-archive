### Description
For the Habitica website (habitica.com), this hides Pets, Mounts, Quest Bosses, Equipment, and Backgrounds that display creatures that can trigger phobias, and also animated items which can be distracting.

You must select the creatures you want to hide before you install the extension using the "Advanced Style Settings" button below. To change your selections, delete the style and reinstall it.

It does not hide Pet Eggs or Quest scrolls (except where otherwise indicated) since those usually don't display clear images of the animals. 

Email me at lady_alys@oldgods.net to have other types of creatures added or if you find that the existing settings don't hide all the items they should. If you don't hear back from me within a week, please email me again.

When an avatar uses one of the hidden backgrounds, the extension hides the full avatar, not just the background.

### Update notes
Version 2.8. Added an "Animations" option to hide all animated Equipment, Pets, Mounts, and Backgrounds. If you enable this, avatars that use an animated Background will be completely invisible. Animated hatching potions and NPC characters are not hidden because you see them only when you are looking at the Shop or Inventory.  If you still see animated items, email lady_alys@oldgods.net and describe which ones.
