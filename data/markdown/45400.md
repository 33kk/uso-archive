### Description
I tried to revamp my old userstyle, to let it fit the completely overhauled website at http://book.cakephp.org. This style is dedicated to all the nightowls who like to keep their melatonin-level as high as possible, without fiddling with the monitor settings. If your brain chemistry really reacts? Please ask a competent person working at Max-Planck-Institute, MIT or the DARPA.

The colours are wild. You're best to keep with the vanilla old design.
