### Description
A lot of items on the "My Ebay" page usually cause a lot of scrolling - which is pretty annoying. So with this style I tried to compact the design of the My Ebay (Beta) pages by removing spaces (paddings/margins) and chosing smaller font sizes. Not perfect, but for me it does its job :-)
