### Description
Hide certain promo elements on The Atlantic sidebar (related content, sidebar elements, etc.) and article area (top profile, share buttons, etc.)
Not including adboxes to hide, because I prefer to give the magazine those ad views. There are other ways to hide ads if that is your preference.

### Update notes
Edited 9/23/12: Split off the comment section mods to http://userstyles.org/styles/75432/the-atlantic-comment-section-mods?r=1348421886
Edited 9/22/12 to add the new slider box that recommends one related article when you scroll near the bottom of the article.
