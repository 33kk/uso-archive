### Description
Shortens Facebook Application feed items on profiles and News Feed, adding a "Details" link to the full feed story description (and others of that app). Application-generated updates are also grayed out to further de-emphasize.

The included screenshots are zoomed into just the newsfeed (this site requires very small images, so they're also scaled down quite a bit).

This works on both the user profile's Mini-Feed and your home News Feed (home.php and profile.php)
but purposefully excludes the filtered pages they link to (stories.php and minifeed.php).
