### Description
Dark theme in the Bathys style, which is closely related to the DeepDark theme.

Code highlighting is using a scheme similar to the Oblivion Eclipse theme (but not quite the same, since the syntax highlighting works a bit differently on SO compared to Eclipse).

For now, only works for StackOverflow - the other StackExchange sites have a lot of other styling to cut through. This will eventually change. Patches welcome!
