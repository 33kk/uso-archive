### Description
Colors the borders of a tab with RED for active tab, BLUE for a normal tab, GREEN for a still unread tab, MAGENTA(FUCHSIA) for loading/reloading tab. In other words distinguishes tabs as active tab, viewed tab, unviewed tab. Does not affect the background color of a tab so that color usage of "Perma Tabs" ("Perma Tabs Mod"), and/or "Multiple Tab Handler" extensions will prevail. Bottom border color will show up even if tabs on the tabs bar have been squeezed down so much that only the favicon can be seen.

This style will also rearrange the toolbars.  Since you chose this style you  probably prefer the more logical "Tabs on Bottom" arrangement  (0)Title Bar, (1) Menu Bar, (2) Location Bar, (3) Personal Bookmarks bar, (4) Tabs Bar.   If you don't want that you can remove the "ordinal" order lines at the bottom of the style, or change to suit yourself.

The next section has installation information for a needed extension, and a list of companion styles.  Warning: USE THE SCROLL BAR.
