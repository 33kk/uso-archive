### Description
A Google theme for Furries. Not complete yet as I'm trying to figure out how to change the logo and keep the background when you are is the results screen. I'm also gonna resize the photo too so it fits the whole photo.
Image in search screen was made by AotoAka and can be found here: https://www.furaffinity.net/full/23712234/
Logo was made by Snow Fangs I think? https://userstyles.org/users/329223
But I made the background of the logo transparent
I used Google Search Custom Background Image by Cruse_Car to make this theme.
If Logo does not appear let me know.
There is a bug that causes the logo to appear in signed out accounts profile images, I'll need to find out how to fix that otherwise its a minor bug..
