### Description
Essentially this does the same thing as my other style sheet here: http://userstyles.org/styles/2084

Except in this style, the icons only appear when mousing over links, and they disappear when moving the mouse away from links. It's helpful for identifying what a link is bringing you to before you click on it. Works on most browsers.

P.S. If you are using the GreaseKit add-on for Safari, you may load this as a user script. If wrapped in script, most CSS styles (including this one) are fully compatible with GreaseKit.
