### Description
This style makes all the input fields in the 'New Facebook' go back to having a white color, as opposed to the light gray color they have by default (which I find ugly :P). If there's any input fields I'm missing, let me know - I'll update as I find anything I missed, but I'm pretty sure I've gotten them all now.

Aug 13th, 2008 - Gah! missed one - fixed now though :D

Aug 15th, 2008 - Fixed so that fields for editing an event are white now too.
