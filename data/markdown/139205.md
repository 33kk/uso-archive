### Description
An absolutely bare minimum attempt at a dark theme for wowprogramming.com

Modifies all elements as of this writing to be legible in the new dark theme, although the colors used are my personal preference, not necessarily designed to be pleasant to every eye.

The style is highly commented, so if something doesn't suit you, you should be able to edit it on your own with minimal CSS knowledge (like me!).

Hopefully this is useful to any budding WoW addon developer who happens to use Stylish and happens to spend all their time coding in the dark.
