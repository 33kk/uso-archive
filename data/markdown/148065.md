### Description
My version of Spotify focus on personal taste - Your taste. 

This style can really be as clean or complicated as you wish.
I personally prefer the clean look out no. 2 - 7  (those with seamless patterns) - they are really sharp. But you might like anything else..... Feel free...

Finally, here is a picture with<b><mark><a href="https://image.ibb.co/iMGnLe/SpotTrio.png"> four other examples</a></mark></b> how you could alter the design - click on the picture to enlarge (they are made with an older version, but you will grasp the possibilities).

I hope you will enjoy it :)

### Update notes
Update Dec 22, 2018: 
- Added a few more options for you, adjusted to the new login/register page and various cosmetic changes. 
_____________________________________  

The simple way to handle this style:
1. Just install my style (and accept all default choices).
2. Have a look on the result, and change what you want afterwards with a click on the "Customize Settings"-button here above.
3. Hit "Update Style"-button to execute the changes. You can of course repeat the procedure and change again how often as you want (there is no need to reinstall the style). 

You can....
<span>&#9733;</span>    Choose your wallpaper as you like, my suggestions or pick one from your drive / the Web  
<span>&#9733;</span>    Choose to use RANDOM wallpapers from Unsplash.com as an extra option. If you choose this option you will get a new wallpaper every time you start up Spotify, you can also hit the F5-key to manually change wallpaper to next. 
Unsplash's images is not always of highest quality and sometimes also too bright (makes reading text more difficult), therefore I recommend you to use the option to adjust to a darker tone. On my own screen around 50 to 60% is a decent trade off - but try out what you prefer.
See this self explaining <b><a href="https://image.ibb.co/cELcu9/Unsplash_random_wallpaper.png">picture</a></b> how to choose this option.
<span>&#9733;</span>    Add a darker tone to the wallpaper for better image depth
<span>&#9733;</span>    Change colors on text, menus, bars etc. Just pick your favorites from the color chart  
<span>&#9733;</span>    Change border colors
<span>&#9733;</span>    Select semi-transparent (or solid) background on the navigation- & play control bar
<span>&#9733;</span>    Add a frame + semi-transparent background to the playlists, or keep it clear 
<span>&#9733;</span>   Change the Spotify icon (animations & borderstyles)
<span>&#9733;</span>   Change font

You will also get....
<span>&#9733;</span>    Small animation effects here and there, bouncing album photos when you hover over the picture of current now-playing-song.  
<span>&#9733;</span>   Compact mode on play control and the tracklists rows, meaning you will use your screen a lot better without sacrificing visibility.
<span>&#9733;</span>   Do not miss the option to adjust the wallpaper to a darker tone. This can improve the image depth or hide image noise, and also make the text more visible on a bright wallpaper.
<span>&#9733;</span>   I have also updated the login page to Spotify with animations.

This style work with Firefox (recommended) & Chrome, maybe other browsers as well.

Note! 
A specific Chrome issue: Animations looks more blurry and will not be as crisp as in Firefox. This is an  <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=animation+chrome+blur&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab">infamous bug of Chrome</a></b> and have nothing to do with my style. Chrome's and Firefox's Spotify icon (the homebutton) differ in the design for that reason in my style. 

If you want to turn off the animation = Click on the "Customize Settings"-button, go to "Animate the Spotify icon" and choose the "No"-option, and click on "Update Style"-button again.
