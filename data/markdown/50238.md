### Description
This is an update to my recent Thunderbird 5.0 Simple Silver/Gray style that overrides the toolbar transparency.  I decided to modify the folder icons as well in this update, as I didn't like the "sideways" yellow folder icon used for custom folders.  At the same time, I modified the Delete button image on the main toolbar as the default "circle/slash" icon seemed a bit sloppy and I wanted to use a more standard "X" icon for deleting.  I also used a different "Attachment" icon for the message pane column header, as the angular yellow paperclip just wasn't my style and not in keeping with the silver/gray-toned style I was creating.  If you want this style but with color folder icons (rather than the greyscale icons), please see my other version of this style at: http://userstyles.org/styles/50147/thunderbird-style-simple-silver-gray
