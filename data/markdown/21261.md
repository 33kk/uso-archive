### Description
Developed for www.Cnn.com

Dark blue backgrounds with Red links and White text for those of you that are tired of the Black on White.

Many of the ad blocks are removed as well as much of the clutter stuff.

[b]Updates:[/b]
 9/28/2009 - Changed text color for the AmFix.Blog section of the site.
10/07/2011 - Fixed the blog.cnn section to change the text color from black to white.
           - Adjusted to only affect the main site, CnnMoney, and the blogs sections.

They keep changing their add blocks. I am currently working on a solution to this so it'll be more dynamic and adjust as they do.

Feel free to post any suggestions, requests, or errors.
