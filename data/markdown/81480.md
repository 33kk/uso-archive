### Description
Turns xda-developers.com dark. Although the user style is applied to all XDA pages (portal, forums, wiki) and suits them all, it's fully optimized for the forums.
Customizable Colors version: http://userstyles.org/styles/96703/dark-xda-custom-colors

<b>Make sure you're using the "XDA 2013 Beta" forum theme</b> (you can check/change your theme in the Forum's footer). Also compatible with "XDA 2013 Beta - 1024" with minor bugs (nav bar icons appearing when they shouldn't).

<b>Non firefox users:</b> Some things aren't correctly applied for Chrome/Other browser. These include:
<ul>
<li> Some borders are much darker than what they should be.
</ul>

This theme is mainly tested on Firefox. Minimal testing is done on Chrome, to ensure nothing breaks.

<strong>Please check the XDA thread for more info and <u>extra modifications/tweaks</u>.
