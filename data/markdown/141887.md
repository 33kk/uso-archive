### Description
<b>Important: Click the "Show Css Code" button first. The install button will work after that.</b> I highly recommend this <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/">style</a> that makes the "Show Css Code" button much easier to find. ― This simple code has been created to hide all the author's deleted styles and align a few contents in the middle of their cell table to appeal the eyes. [ <b>Version:</b> 1.0.0b | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/NA/pub">View change logs</a> (None) ]
