### Description
This style works on all pages, and subpages except the folowing:
| Homepage |
| Battles |
| MyMag |
| Quiz |
| Hot |
| Video |
| Pimp |
| Groups |
| Auctions |
| Cliffnotes |

These pages will probably never have a style. If you want me to make a style for one of those pages message me on myyearbook and I will make one.
The following pages CAN NOT have a style:
| Battles |
| MyMag |
| Quiz |
and possibly more from above.
I can remove the adds and all of the useless buttons/icons/text on EVERY page though.

###If you use my old style, "MyYearbook.com Clean Up" with this style, the match maker will be messed up, to fix this problem, disable the MyYearbook.com Clean Up while you use the matchmaker.###
