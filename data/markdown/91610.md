### Description
Custom Tumblr logo for your dashboard.

"<i>The coat of arms of the city of Paris dates back to 1111, when King Charles I officially installed it. On the coat of arms, the represented vessel is the symbol of the powerful corporate body of the Marchands de l'eau, dating back to the Middle Ages. The city motto, "Fluctuat nec mergitur" ("She is tossed by the waves, but does not sink") is equally a reference to this boat.</i>" <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Paris">*</a></sup>
