### Description
<b>This style is obsolete.</b> Go for the <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/>Download YouTube Videos as MP4</a> addon instead.

Easy YouTube Video Downloader is an awesome extension for Firefox that allows you to download YouTube videos in various formats. Unfortunately it doesn't go with any particular theme unless it's forced to through other styles.

This style is for people who don't want to use an entirely different theme, but rather make it conform (At least initially) to the YouTube standard theme.
