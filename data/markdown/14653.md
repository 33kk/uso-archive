err...in fact,  I *REALLY* don't like to post many styles that only changing for color of image... but now I know the reasons... 
also I just found that I just remember the first style I made is used to customize background color AND linked effects easier
it become NOT necessary to install this style, just copy the image below and use the default way to change the background image ...
Ooo.... yea, wasting spaces of userstyle.org.. :\
