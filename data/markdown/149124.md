### Description
This is an update to <a href='https://userstyles.org/styles/95794/stackexchange-multicollider-superdropdown-fixes'>style 95794</a> – as the MultiCollider™ was updated in 9/2017 again. I made it a separate style as it wasn't updated for all SE sites (yet). Please read for details on my original UserStyle. Not all features have been picked up here (e.g. the coloring part was skipped).
