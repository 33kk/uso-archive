### Description
Usually my goal is to eliminate distractions, whether those be ads or click bait for related content regardless of how tenuous that "relationship" might be. I reluctantly hide copyright and other footer blocks because I only ever refer to them when I first start using a site or if I feel the need to provide feedback to the site admin. When that need arises it is easiest to simply disable stylish to gain visibility of whatever I've hidden.
