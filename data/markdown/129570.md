### Description
Introducing Compozy, a faithful evolution of the default Discord UI that aims to maintain its cleanliness and breathability, while slimming down on oversized elements and wasteful negative space. The goal is to show as much information on screen as possible, while simultaneously avoiding the sensation of everything feeling cramped or cluttered.
