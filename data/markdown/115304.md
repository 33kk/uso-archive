### Description
This style makes Battlelog look a bit cleaner and removes some of the clutter. It applies mostly to the BF4 and BFH sites, but there are some sitewide changes that apply to BF3 and MOHW too. It also applies to the CTE sites and new forums.

If you notice any problems you can leave feedback below or send me a tweet (@zhpete) and I'll look in to it. I may also update the style with things I notice at a later date.

### Update notes
v1.22
-Fixed style not applying on urls using https rather than http.


v1.21
BF3 (Whoa, supporting Battlefield 3 in 2017!?)
-Added an option to make the Server Browser Filters section more compact. With this option enabled, each section must be expanded by hovering the mouse over the headings. I have made it optional as it may not be desirable for everyone, and it is somewhat experimental so may not work perfectly.

BFH
-The homepage main news article picture now reacts to the mouse hovering over it.


v1.20
New Battlefield Forums
-Removed most of my tweaks since the UI has been reworked


v1.19
New Battlefield Forums
-Made a first pass of improving the visual style of the new forums; the all black theme was uggo.
-Added an option to choose a background image for the forums.


v1.18
BFH
-Added an option to hide rank progress/experience bars and the "Become Legendary" button. (This is for people who have hit max rank and don't care about Legendary status)


v1.17
BFH
-Adjusted the alignment of the class service stars on the profile overview page.


v1.16
Sitewide
-The headers on the player weapon stats table are now aligned centrally.


v1.15
Sitewide
-Changed the background when hovering over the icons in the top right (Profile, Reports, Notifications etc) to fit the overall theme.


v1.14
Sitewide
-That damn survey just keeps coming back doesn't it? Don't worry; it's gone now.


v1.13
BFH
-Reduced the margin under the mainpage recommended server to match the margin above it.
-Maybe some other stuff? I forget.


v1.12
BFH and BF4
-Visual tweaks to various chat related things to fit the overall style


v1.11
BFH and BFH CTE
-Replaced the default weapon paint icon from loadouts to differentiate it from black paint


v1.10
BFH and BFH CTE
-Changed the background behind the text on the home page news item to make it easier to read

-Attachment vouchers from battlepacks are now "grayed out" if they have been used, making it easier to see useful vouchers. (The devs have since removed used vouchers entirely, so this is now redundant)

-Removed color from overlay from recommended server with friends playing, adjusted black overlay and added transparency to background
-Fix for the reply button covering the top right corner of the text field when replying to a forum post. As a result the Preview and Post buttons are on the left, not the right. Let me know if this broke anything for you.
