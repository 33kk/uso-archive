### Description
This is a very simple style to view most google services in Segoe UI 8pt
The only reason for adding this here right now is since Chrome doesn't have a userstyles extension yet.

This style doesn't apply to all of googles services, infact as of now it only applies to GMail, GCalendar & GReader.
Also applies to "Remember the Milk" gadget since i use that on GMail and GCalendar.

This will also remove the invite a friend box in GMail.
