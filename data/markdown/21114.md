### Description
***UPDATE 3/2/10***
I've updated this again, now the link to invite people on the owned section is gone, the new promotional boxed above the actions is gone forever. On the matchmaker, once you've picked all of your admires, the message box that says there are no more secret admires is now the same size as the menu bar.


This cleans up the homepage after you log in.
This removes all ads on every page.
This makes pages smaller so you have to scroll less.
This removes most useless buttons.
This removes all links to buy L$ and VIP.

You do not need to use AdBlockPlus on myyearbook anymore with this style.
