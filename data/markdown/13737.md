### Description
Make the TwitterFox window taller so that you can see more tweets and get more done!

Combine it with Wider TwitterFox Window and it's even better.  http://userstyles.org/styles/13133

If the window is to tall for you, edit the CSS once in Stylish and change the height and max-height to something that you like more.
