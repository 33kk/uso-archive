### Description
For the MMORPG Swcombine.com

Universal for dark backgrounds - this uses the unlit icons from the grey scheme. 
Use the version for your particular scheme unless you frequently change skins.

Replaces lit/blinking alert icons with the unlit version. By default this affects all buttons. If you wish to re-enable any of the buttons, remove the comment marks (slashes and asterisks) from the beginning (just before "img .." and end of each code block. Refer to the Flashnews block as an example - don't remove the comment marks around the title ( Flashnews, Darkness Message, etc.)
