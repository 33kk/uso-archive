### Description
Updated version of style 14747 for the new release of Friendfeed.  Same goals, same 'tightening up' of all comments, feed posts, etc.

(taken from older version...)

Changed the font, font size, and margin/padding for some of the FriendFeed entry, comment, etc. divs to make viewing FF a little more compact. Also made the left navbar a bit narrower, and also added soft dotted lines between main entry divs, and made all entry/comment divs use the whole width of the page.

This helps compact things a bit and make it easier to get through more feeds & comments faster.

[Update 06.05.09: Sidebar was overlaying the main 'body' div at some window widths; fixed.]
