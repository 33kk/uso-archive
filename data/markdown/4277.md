### Description
This styles allows you to print an invoice from MozyPro's control panel. Their support for clean and clear invoices is terrible, perhaps the only drawback from the service and it is a big one. I was told by MozyPro over the phone that they plan on implementing a better system of invoicing based on user request, but it didn't sound like they were too far along in the process, so I decided to help myself to their hooks and apply a little user style.
