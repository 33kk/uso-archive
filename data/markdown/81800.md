### Description
Substitute following fonts to Leelawadee font. 

- Cordia New
- MS Sans Serif & Microsoft Sans Serif
- AngsanaUPC & Angsana New
- CordiaUPC & Cordia New
- Tahoma

Note: Leelawadee is Thai UI font on Microsoft Windows Vista/7/8 and onward. It optimized for on-screen display and works well with ClearType. For Thai contents, IMHO, it looks better and easy to the eyes than Tahoma.

Note 2: Due to image scaling, the screenshot on the left is not shown accurately. Please click on the image to see a proper sized image.

Note 3: For Windows 10, there is a new font named Leelawadee UI which improve clarity for both regular and bold font. You can edit CSS source from Leelawadee to Leelawadee UI yourself. Highly recommended
