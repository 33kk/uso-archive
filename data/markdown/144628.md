### Description
minimization of user interface (mini-panel, mini borders)
elements reposition like at jsfiddle
red 'login'/'sign in' btns (u can see if u unauthorized)

updated:
* if pen is unsaved save btn will glows red (or red-orange, i don't know what color name is rgb(255,60,25) XD)
* run btn glyph changed to triangle (like 'play')
* Menu items 'pens', 'projects', 'posts' and 'collections' are brought to the 'Your pens' (and so on) and to the normal view style (like the other menu elements) with a large black font, free zone around and hover

PS: my recommendation is use it with style "Codepen: Hidable Editors & Responsiveness" by Long Lazuli
