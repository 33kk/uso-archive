### Description
A Poe.Trade-inspired style for the official Path of Exile Trade website (pathofexile.com/trade)
----------
<strike>Version 0.1.4 onwards will no longer be updated via userstyles.org due to the security reasons from Stylish which is the default suggested extension here, please follow the official GitHub repo (<a href="https://github.com/survfate/AllanPls">https://github.com/survfate/AllanPls</a>) for any future update</strike>
7/23 UPDATE: Since I found out that Stylus support userstyles.org, I have decided to continue support userstyles.org, however please make sure that you have Stylus and not Stylish installed
