### Description
Recent change to the Rock Band forums have left us with the "BRILLIANT" color choice of charcole text on black background and gigantic line spacing.  This is my first attempt at stylish code and all it does is fix the text to white.  It's a gigantic difference and I'd like to follow it up with a fix to the line spacing when I learn how.
