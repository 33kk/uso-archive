### Description
Currently, the #newtwitter layout doesn't quite fit into a half-screen window on a 1920-px widescreen monitor. I don't maximize my browser, but I often snap it to the side of the screen, and the resultant horizontal scrollbar in Twitter bothers me. This style alters the layout slightly to fit into a 940px-wide window.
