### Description
Neutral Dark Gray style for Ipernity, a photo sharing site. In addition to being dark, the overall feel is more interactive, including dynamic number of columns in thumbnails views, which reduces the need for scrolling. The size of the style exceeds Stylish maximum, so it is split in two parts. All you have to do is download and activate them both.
