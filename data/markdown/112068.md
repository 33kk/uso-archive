### Description
I hate white backgrounds, so I wrote this style for Google's main search and search results pages. Features include removing ads from search results and Google being black (duh). I also commented this userstyle so that it should be very easy to modify some of the font colors to personalize it on your own. If you use this userstyle you are a cool person.
