### Description
A start page without the blinding light for late night sessions. Also changes icon-bounds to round shapes because they look objectively better. Nothing is completely black, as per important Material Design rule.

Unfortunately couldn't change thumbnails, as they seem to be generated somewhat differently. Even !important doesn't seem to do the trick.
