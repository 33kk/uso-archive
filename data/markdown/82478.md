### Description
Little Alchemy - ALL BLACK BACKGROUNDS

Black is easier on the eyes and since I run ubuntu linux, i like to have some of my fancy windows be glassed out
(with blur+transparency) so, this theme works good for that (kde users, click your title bar and go to more actions->
window opacity-> 90% -> forced it looks good that way) of course it looks good just plain too, check out it for yourself, the previews probably wont do justice since im using auto-previews for now.
