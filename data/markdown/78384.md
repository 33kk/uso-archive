### Description
Some simple changes to news.ycombinator.com. The goal was to improve readability without compromising too much of the density and style of HN. Changes default font (only for comments) to 17px Georgia, makes the site fixed width at 1100px so that it never gets way too wide, increases line height slightly, and also fixes comment width at 685px as per Golden Ratio Typography (http://www.pearsonified.com/typography/). 

In addition, lets you highlight the names of users you care about by adding more rules to the stylesheet. Example: 

a[href$='tptacek'],
a[href$='grellas'],
a[href$='patio11'],
{
  color: #FF6600 !important;
}

Now the users "tptacek", "grellas", and "patio11" will show up in the HN orange to highlight their comments more easily. The only user highlighted by default is PG (Paul Graham).
