### Description
WARNING: THIS WILL BREAK A LOT OF WEBSITE ELEMENTS.
This style is a rushed CSS for AnimeLyrics.com. It is intended for use of non-members who just want to browse the site and focus on viewing the lyrics. If you're a member or a regular user who browses several parts of the site, this style would break your experience.

Features
◈ dark interface so viewing is easier on the eyes
◈ kill all ads on lyrics pages and song list pages
◈ reduce the amount of bloat elements and images on the website
◈ view lyrics on 50%-50% width, so there's no weird space on the right
◈ centered lyrics with bigger fonts for easier reading

Note: Install the font "Open Sans" for best viewing experience.

I wouldn't probably be updating this style anymore, as the website was poorly done and the elements weren't tagged properly.
