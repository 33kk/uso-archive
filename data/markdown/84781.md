### Description
&bull; Changes font family <em>for tasks only</em> to <span style="font-family: Tahoma;">"Tahoma".</span> This is fairly legible with what follows.

&bull; Changes color of task-info, but not tasks themselves, to a <span style="color: #595959;">gray</span> better matching iOS 3 app.

&bull; <strong><span style="color: #700000;">Changes</span> <span style="color: #B26E01;">priority</span> <span style="color: #797006;">colors</span> to match the priority corners on the iOS 3 app,</strong> with the exception of "Low" priority. There is no CSS hook in Toodledo distinguishing <span style="color: #6E6E6E;">Low</span> and <span style="color: #6E6E6E;">Negative</span> priority, so this is unavoidable.

&bull; <strong>Bolds</strong> all tasks. This is desirable because the prioritized colors of the tasks can be a little on the light side. Also, in the app itself, the same font weight (in that case, <em>not</em> bolded, but dark text) is used for the different priorities.
