Simple tool for changing your pet image with any image you want. Now you can enjoy having unicorns and alikes instead of usual pets. Created with <a href="http://www.eldarya.com/#/player/profile/Nymphe">Driada's</a> help. 
Really nice designs <a href="http://irinadg58.tumblr.com/">by Irina!</a>

The main image is 450x450px(although it may vary due to screen resolution).
The header is 73x73px.
Hue change affects the colour of the pet. For reference look <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/HueScale.svg/743px-HueScale.svg.png">here.</a>
0 is default colour.
Also, you can use <a href="http://markable.in/file/149f048c-c7ea-11e4-b0c8-00259026e590/">image database</a>  , where you'll find original pet images.
It changes the look for you and you only and does not change any game aspect.

If you like it feel free to add me <a href="http://www.eldarya.com/#/player/profile/Yunaan">here.</a> I'm talkative and would love to hear various opinions not only about the game :D
