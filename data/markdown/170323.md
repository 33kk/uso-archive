### Description
A nice dark mode theme for Oranda.com Web Trader inspired by TradingView.com
Applies to https://trade.oanda.com

In order to get the Chart itself to apply the dark theme, additional steps are required. 

For automatic dark theme on the Chart:

1) Install Tampermonkey Extension.
2) Add my companion custom script:
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/381079-oanda-com-trading-platform-enable-chart-dark-theme

Or do it manually every time the page loads:

1) Open developer tools (F12), 
2) Search (Ctrl+F) for "iframe",
3) Click the little triangle to the left of it to expand the [iframe] element node,
4) Click the little triangle to the left of it to expand the [#document] element node
5) Double click the block of words after inside the [html class="feature-js ..."] tag, 
6) Finally type "theme-dark" (without quotes). 

It will now automatically apply the dark theme to the chart as well. This is required due to a technical limitation of applying CSS to an [iframe] element.
