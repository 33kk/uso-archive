### Description
Have made a few changes since the first version, namingly those below.

Design is fixed inside 1000px width. The reason for this is due to UserStyles not actually having much text in a given area at one time, it was pretty pointless stretching areas of text that are only composed of a few words over lots of screen space, it looked a little silly with the smaller text of this style.

General layout changes, main page has what would be the sidebar sat above the content area.

Some changes to how poor and good ranked styles are shown. Good ranked styles will show a star next them (even userstyles standard design doesn't do that).

Shortened some code, changed some hover effects and also changed the header a little to.

Centered text in some areas to fit with the next layout.

Check it out, if you don't like it, please post and make a suggestion (screenshot does not do the design any justice).
Any bugs please email them to my name @ hotmail .co.uk (replacing "my name" for my userstyles name of course).

UPDATE: Ad removal fixed, and some mods to the way ranks are shown when viewing style list.
Single star - Good rank
Half star - Medium rank
Empty star - Unranked
No star, red text - Poor rank
