### Description
A cleaner layout which improves readability and accessibility/usability. This includes fixing issues such as text overflow and inconsistent spacing. This style does not change colours or effects such as box-shadow or border-radius (see my style for "improved aesthetic with cleaner layout"), but focuses on sizing, positioning and following popular conventions for usability.
