### Description
Made for my new monitor at 1600x900 resolution
works for 1440x900 Too ! ! !

It renders the video player at 1000x570 which is perfect for me.

This style can be used alone 
but was originally meant to be used with Valacar's style 1078  


***UPDATE***___8/16/2009
This style now works with user profile and channel pages
***UPDATE***

***UPDATE***___10/17/2009
This style now only works with youtube (thanks to Inhuman and ChoGGi )
***UPDATE***

I know there are still a few very small bugs i will try to address later

Enjoy !
