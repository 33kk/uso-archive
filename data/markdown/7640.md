### Description
For the new vBulletin board. Works with both Hero and Villain themes. Requires you to use the boards.cityofheroes.com URL instead of .cityofvillains.com or .coh.com.

It gets rid of the huge logo and background image, and eliminates most of the gradients in the backgrounds.
It also sets most of the text to use Verdana.
