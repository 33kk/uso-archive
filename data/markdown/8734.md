### Description
A style that makes WordReference.com black and red instead of purple and blue. It also removes "useless" things, including items on the search dropdown menu. (But you'll have to mess with the code to get what you want. ;) There's a list of menu items in the code.)

Feel free to edit the code to change the colors or whatever.
