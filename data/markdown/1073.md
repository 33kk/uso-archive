### Description
Removes the ads from TV.com and allows the columns to move up and take the ads place. It also removes the footer junk and the CNET network nav bar thing at the top.

This style also makes the navigation bar's font a little smaller because its too big for me on linux and messes the layout up. You can just remove that part if you don't need it.
