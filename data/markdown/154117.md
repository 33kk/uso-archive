### Description
After seeing this image floating around the net I was mesmerized. It was provided by Jord-UK so check out the rest of his art @ https://jord-uk.deviantart.com/

*Added some tweaks from Pedro J. Miranda's theme as I really like the effects he added to the Default Pok√©mon Showdown*

### Update notes
