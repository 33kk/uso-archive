### Description
<strong>This style is broken and no longer maintained. See below...</strong>
<br><br>
This is a fork of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/96733/headerbar-style-for-gnome-3-16">this style</a>, which does not work with the global dark theme because it relies on a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/darkwdec/">broken add-on</a> to automatically select the correct theme. I've made these changes:

<ul>
<li>Works with dark theme (and dark theme only)</li>
<li>Blue highlight for the URL bar when you're typing in it!</li>
<li>Tab height increased to fit in with other gnome apps</li>
<li>No rounded corners at all (though there's code you can uncomment if you want rounded corners). They create ragged edges and split-screen windows aren't supposed to have rounded corners anyway.</li>
</ul>
