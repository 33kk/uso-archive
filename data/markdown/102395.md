### Description
Webmin Ubuntu style for Webmin's StressFree theme. First install and apply StressFree theme in Webmin. Replace IP and port with yours to make it work. Made it quite a while ago and have no time to make it as standalone Webmin theme. Progressbars wouldn't work on Firefox as Gecko has limited CSS3 support.
