### Description
The new Gmail style has lots of whitespace, and messages in the conversation view are less distinct.  This style makes several changes:

<ul>
<li> Round corner boxes around messages, like the old style.
<li> Gradient message header.
<li> More compressed throughout, both in expanded messages, closed, and elided messages.
</ul>
