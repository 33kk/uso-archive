### Description
Works on Google Search and Google Images. Best suited for styles that use background images.
The Google Bar, Logo, Search Bar, buttons and footer links are invisible until hovered over (with transition).
So you have an unobstructed view of the background image.
<strong>Everything is still there when you need it.</strong>
