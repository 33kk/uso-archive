### Description
<u><strong>IMPORTANT:</u> You need the <a href="https://zotplus.github.io/report-customizer/index.html">Report Customizer add-on</a> to use this style.</strong> 

Zotero generates reports in HTML format, which is awesome except we can't hide the fields we don't care about.

This stylesheet hides everything except the title, authors, date of publication, BibTeX key (if you have Better BibTeX installed), and child notes, which is how I like my reports to be formatted when I print them as a reference.

With regards to printing, I've also shrunk the text by 2 point sizes to 10pt, and allowed the notes list to break across pages.
