### Description
Changes all the colors on del.icio.us to blue, all text, all links, tags list, and even the edit bundle tags. I had to make this cause I was sick of delicious plain white color and that red really annoyed me. love my blue :)

UPDATE: I removed the sponsored links. Can't believe I left that out.
