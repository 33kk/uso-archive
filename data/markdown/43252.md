### Description
If you want to remove inessential clutter from Google Search pages, this user style is for you.

The Google Search Enlightener user style is specific to the "www" and "encrypted" subdomains (the latter being currently available for the ".com" TLD only) and is applied on every TLD supported by Google.

It removes, amongst other things, the navigation sidebar and the related searches box.  It also tweaks widths and margins to contain horizontal sprawl, which should render results pages more usable on smaller displays.
