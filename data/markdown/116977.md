### Description
Change Kentin sprites to Ken sprites!

Have you ever been curious what it would be like if Ken never transformed into Kentin? Try this cool style out! 

You don’t have to like old ken to try it! You can add it just out of curiosity! It’s easy to turn off.

What it does;

-Switches out all of Kentin’s sprites to Ken Sprites.

What it doesn’t do;

-Change dialogue

-Change illustrations

 I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised. :3

All you have to do for this to be yours is download “Stylish” to your browser and then go to this link and download the style! Simple!

I’ve added the other site versions for this as well (Amour Sucre, Corazon de Melon, etc.)!

Thank you to Driada/EldaryaNightmare for help with the coding!
