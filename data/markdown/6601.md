### Description
If you have vista, you should definitely try out glasser, which gives you aero effects in the nav-bar. I've redone this theme for glasser, and will be doing future updates there:
style 7065

A lot of work went into this - if you appreciate it, please support my work.
v1.2

Only tested on Windows. Please post screenshots and post in forums for bugs.
====>IMPORTANT: Unfortunately, it is impossible to code a CSS theme that works right on both windows and linux. So, this is a WINDOWS theme. For a linux theme, please see vbielawski's work.

Show rounded text fields, menulists and more in Firefox 3
Includes webpage fields and multiline fields
shows blue hover and focus for all fields (vista-themed colors)

I've integrated parts my vista statusbar and findbar theming upon (many) requests; 
also shows solo images (if you click "view image") centered, shows wider google results (full-width) - all easy to comment out if you don't like them.

Based on concepts from vbielawski's experimental theme at http://userstyles.org/styles/6463; it made me think to try to re-write my old theme (http://userstyles.org/styles/6292) using borders.

PLEASE post any glitches you find, so I can continue to improve this. 
If anyone can figure out a way to fix overlap issues with select elements and scrollbars, PLEASE let me know. I've tried z-order, clip, -moz-background-clip, transparency, rounding, transparent borders...
For those of you who have problems, _please_ contact me using the "Ask a question or make a suggestion" so that I can reply and post a screenshot; it is much more helpful if you post bugs in the _forums_ section rather than the _reviews_ section.
