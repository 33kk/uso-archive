### Description
Well, title says it all but.....
This style transforms style lists at Userstyles.org into row-wise numbered ones.

It should be compatible with most userstyles for this site (as well as my style 11912).

Latest update: Changed padding back.
Update: Linux check showed that paddings should be adjusted. (sorry for frequent update)
Update: Added background for hover effect to ease the reading of long style names.
