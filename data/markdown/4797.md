### Description
A simple style to make the online version more suitable for printing.
Designed to be printed with "print colors and borders" option enabled.
Some elements of pages are hidden (navigation, comments, etc), and the font is changed to serif for more convenient reading.
Looks fairly well when printed double-sided and "two pages on one side".
