### Description
Now removes sponsored posts!

By default, Tumblr has a confusing style with random bold fonts, odd text sizes (especially quotes), and strange color gradients. This style fixes these problems, and improves a few other issues with Tumblr, like the ugly "static" effect on videos, large rounded corners, and more. Try it out, and leave a comment if you have issues.
