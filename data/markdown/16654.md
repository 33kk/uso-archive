### Description
This will make your URL bar and your search bar transparent in Firefox. For this to work, I think your computer must already support Aero in Vista.

This goes very well with the All-Glass Firefox addon which can be found at

Fixed issue where the search engine menu was also made transparent and hard to read.

Enjoy
