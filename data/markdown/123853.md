### Description
<p>Naut is a customized CSS for reddit made by reddit user Cryptonaut, found on /r/Naut. It is used in many subreddits natively through subreddit styles and RES. I made a global version of Naut's theme, and created a dark version. It is updated to Naut 4.0, and looks better than ever.</p>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> To make this style universal, you have to turn off "allow subreddits to show me custom themes" under display options in your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/prefs/" target="_blank">reddit preferences</a>. Or if you use RES, you can turn off individual subreddit styles that do not work well with Naut.</p>
