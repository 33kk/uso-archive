### Description
In case people want to change certain behaviours of style 10335 and style 15138, this can be applied on top of it and if you comment in/out the appropriate sections. [i.e. Make sure to turn it on after you turn on the base style, otherwise it will not work]

Among other things, it should make it play nicer with Facebook Fixer.

Everything is, by default, commented out. Comment in what you want.
