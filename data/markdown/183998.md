### Description
This is a complete rework of the site made in a dark theme with subtle contrasts. Everything here is done by me except the play section, done by Kathy Chiang. 
I suggest you to go to his userstyles page to download his theme if you like light themes: https://userstyles.org/styles/145865/typeracer-modern-v3
