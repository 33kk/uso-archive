### Description
This is a theme.
It has Miku on it.

### Update notes
>8/Jan/12
Major overhaul. Cleaned up the code a little, added fixed, autohiding postbox, and added code for 4chanX elements. Additionally, removed the logo, and made the header a fixed element.

If you're using a posting plugin such as 4chan X, select "No" under "Using Classic Post Window?" below.

>8/Jun/12
Added option to hide a bunch of stuff at the top of the page (and the very last thing on the page)
Changed 4chanX post preview hover boxes to solid colour
Fixed greentext and rounded corners
