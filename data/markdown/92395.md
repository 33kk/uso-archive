### Description
Makes the rebloggable asks on tumblr less busy, space-consuming, and odd. For those of us who don't see a need to butcher aesthetics just because something was updated. Sorry if the options are overwhelming; just play around with them if you like. Or leave them at their default states to end up with what's shown in the preview images.

### Update notes
<b>06.17.14</b> - fixed breakage caused by a needless css class change on tumblr's end

<b>Known Issues:</b>

- tumblr didn't code unique sections for the asker and answerer on reblogged ask posts; it's impossible (as far as I know) to use solely css and independently style the avatar/icon locations and speech bubbles

- as with the above, there's no way to replicate the old style fully, especially since it had bolded text and doing that would make the entirety of an answer bold as well; that's very unappealing

<b>Features:</b>

- full-width asks and answers

- small icons expand on hover for easier viewing, but remain small otherwise to conserve dash space

- [optional] darker background for ask bubbles

- [optional] border between initial ask and answer, and reblogged ask/answer content and additions

- fixed occasional errors on new style where an answer or reblogged comment gets smashed into a tiny area instead of spanning the full width of the post

- [optional] asker and answerer names on separate sides to help differentiate bubbles at a glance

- [optional] removes the "said:" and "answered:" text to ease up on how busy the new default style is visually

- [optional] font and padding options to further reduce unnecessary waste of space

- [optional] completely remove speech bubble arrows and/or icons

- a few other options to customize appearance and space utilized by ask posts

<b>Notes and Credits:</b> The screenshots show tumblr when viewed with my dashboard theme, <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/91837/dark-forest-tumblr-theme">Dark Forest</a> set to completely round icons but otherwise default. X-Kit is also in use with the screenshots, and the Unreverse extension is what's making the post controls appear on top. That is not affected by this style or necessary for it to work.
