### Description
Another style for the Overclockers UK forum...

This is version 1, though i will update it later with a few more changes.....

Stylish/Firefox users just click load in stylish then Preview....

What's changed compared with bog standard blue(non-styled) forum...

Colours - obviously... ;)
Avatars - size reduced a little
Buttons - Quote, reply, etc... using same buttons as dark theme for ocuk, just change them a little, and some others hidden...
Background image added on thread post page and transparency used in posts, enough solidness to keep the text remaining readable though
Nav - Navigation, ie. UserCP, Quicklinks etc are shown top right of the header instead
Search - Search is displayed in the top right corner.

Sure there's a few more little bits, have a look and see what you think...
