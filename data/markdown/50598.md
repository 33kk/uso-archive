### Description
Quite a few people are unhappy http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=2239181 with the new glass effects in Thunderbird 5.0 that, quite frankly, make some menus and buttons unpleasantly hard to read. This style aims to fix that issue.

I also recommend trying out the NoGlass extension if you prefer its look.

If you don't want to install NoGlass as a Thunderbird 5.0 theme, you can also just paste the CSS code into a userstyle.
