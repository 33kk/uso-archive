### Description
[originally "Strata40 - misc. tweaks"]

This style contains miscellaneous tweaks...

• The "Vista-style search go button" part replaces the icon in the searchbar with one that doesn't have as much of a white outline.

• The section commented as "force black text with white glow" does pretty much what it says: 
Toolbar button label-text becomes black, with a white text-shadow 'glow' on it. Looks cool without sacrificing readability.

• "apply aero style to sidebar" is also self-explanatory (needed on XP only).

• It tweaks the 'Checked' status of the Downloads button - users of the AIOS extension know what this means: Strata40's Downloads button icon 'moves' a little bit when it's checked [enabled] in the Sidebar.


EDIT: Just now found another Strata40 tweak, named style 21756. (After spending the time to put this one together, too...) Mine does kinda the same stuff, but has the search-go icon. Both styles should work at the same time. I think.

Suffice it to say that I really made this for personal use, but feel free to tweak this style on your own. 
Comment this style with any suggestions.
