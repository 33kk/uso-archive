### Description
Better Steam is a complete re-style of Steam. I redo colours, as well as sort out positioning, sizing and other things like that too. I also try to make things quicker and easier to use.

Main Features include:
- Fixed steam's horrible navbar
- General restyling, such as buttons, inputs, dropdown menus, profile pages, etc.
- Slightly brighter colours
- Inventory is more compact
- Steam store is more compact

Impacts these sites:
https://steamcommunity.com
https://store.steampowered.com/

Better Steam is a side project which I work on in my spare time, and especially when I feel like it. Of course there are things that need styling, which I will get round to at some point.
