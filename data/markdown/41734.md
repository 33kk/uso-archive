### Description
ATTENTION!!!
This Script is OUTDATED and discontinued!!!
==================================================

This Script changes the way we see the site Peopleware (Pplware) [ http://pplware.sapo.pt ]

I do not say that this is a better way, i only say it is my way!
The style are optimized for 1024 pixels width minimum, this is not a problem since the original site is the same.
