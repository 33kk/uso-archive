Please rate or leave a comment if you liked it or have an idea for something new, cheers!

UPDATE 15/80/2012
Chrome extension, since you have to have it on the chrome store now. This is what I'll be updating -- if you want one for a different browser, let me know!

- Hides offline friends from chat list
- Hide / Dim / Leave Mobile users alone
- Makes people who're idle dimmer
- Changes the colours of idle / offline chat tabs slightly (see screenshot)
- Gets rid of some adverts in the right sidebar

### Update notes
Version 1.20111204 - Added an option to hide the mobile users completely, or leave them alone, or make transparent -- requested by cadtek!

Version 1.20111102 - People on their mobiles have the same style applied as people who're idle. Also hid that "who to subscribe to" thing.

Version 1.20111024 - Hides people who have chat on their mobile from appearing online

Version 1.20000000 - Now it makes the actual chat boxes a bit different colours depending on the person's status. I think it makes it better.

Version 1.0 - Made it, it works, boom.
