### Description
Cron-o-meter uses a single column for both the foods and display of the nutrients. So if you change some food, you have to scroll to see the nutrients changes. This style puts them side by side in 2 columns. You'll probably need a full HD monitor to see them correctly, although I can use the zoom option to fit it in anyway.
