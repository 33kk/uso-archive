### Description
DISCONTINUED 30.09.2018
Just a bright theme i made for mastodon for my own use. Made by https://glitch.social/@soft_chomps. Tested on glitch.social which is running master so it might be a little ahead of the curve with regards to interface changes! Works with any instance. Use the setting.
