### Description
A very dark rendition of Tumblr's usual blue and white dashboard color scheme, with the intention on it being much calmer and easier on your eyes.

This dashboard userstyle is optimized to be used with the following two fonts (you can download them at the respective links):

<a href="https://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Frank_Ruhl_Libre.font">- Frank Ruhl Libre</a>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nW7jjRNwB_DgKTz3FwlJy7BCm8W_u_RG">- Calibri</a>


<b>Important note:</b> If you're struggling reading the text and want to increase it, open the userstyle within Stylus/Stylish, open search (ctrl+f) and look for <i>'Frank Ruhl Libre</i>. You should find 15 instances of it, look at each result and see if you see 'font-size:10px;' within the same div. If you do, that's the font size you should increase. Hope this helps!
