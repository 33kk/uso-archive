### Description
Change your website <b>cursors</b> to any of the nitro type cars.

This applies to all the websites, not just nitro type. However if you want the "only nitro type" version, you can find it here: https://userstyles.org/styles/182373/nitro-type-custom-cursor-nt-cars-cursor

I will be adding more cars to this list.
 but if you want, you can add your own car in the URL under the list by using the car's ID that you want.

 Example: https://www.nitrotype.com/cars/208_small_1.png
That's car is the "Vapor". The ID is 208.

### Update notes
Version: for all websites.
