### Description
Tumblr 'new post' icons for your dashboard.

"<i>Ron Weasley is Harry Potter's first and best friend, his second, his Wheezey, the thing he'd miss most.

He is an utter Gryffindor - brave and loyal - and although smart - as evidenced by his chess-playing ability and considerable wit - he is a fairly average student, and is often too lazy to bother with his studies, a habit enabled by Hermione's perfectionist need to do even other people's work for them.</i>" <sup><a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000991/bio">*</a></sup>
