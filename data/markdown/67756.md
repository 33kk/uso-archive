### Description
Same as the one here: http://userstyles.org/styles/55303/rootzwiki-restyling-for-simplicity only made for 1024x768. This comes with no obligation that I will always update it in the future, since I don't have a monitor this small. If there's something you don't like about my theme, feel free to change it yourself :)

Changelog is the same as the other theme outside of making sure this is the proper width for low res screens.
