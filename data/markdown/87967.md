### Description
I suppose this is a detective-novelish Tumblr label changer? It's the complete companion to two of my older styles, which were deleted. Sorry.

Posts change to Files, followers change to Victims, queue changes to Investigations, likes change to Evidence, following changes to Suspects, drafts to Cold Cases, members to assistants, customize to report, and find blogs to Interrogations.

You can use this as a base code, but I do need credit! Yeah. Contact erikakurumi if some issues come up, I guess.
