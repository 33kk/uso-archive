### Description
<b>BROKEN - Chrome no longer supports Custom.css.</b> This means you have to use extensions (Stylebot, Stylish) and styling internal <code>chrome://</code> pages is strictly not allowed: hide Show Password and hide search engine Make Default button styles fail.
We had a good run while it lasted. Firefox has userContent.css, userChrome.css and now the astonishing gCLI.

Tweaks for Chrome.

<ul><li><b>Slick scrollbar</b></li> No-background, thin, rounded scrollbar
<li><strong>Center images</strong></li> Makes images open prettier - centered, no scrollbars. Great for fullscreen. Pan around by scrolling or middle-click.
<li><strong>Disable Google Chrome default orange glow around inputs and textareas</strong></li>
aka the outline for accessibility purposes
<li><strong>Don't display Most visited sites</strong></li> Buggy. Sometimes top sites show up, but when you refresh they're back in hiding.
</ul>
Read through these, some might be accessibility issues.
