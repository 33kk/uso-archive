### Description
I don't think there's enough contrast between the read and unread discussions on the FogBugz forums. This style makes the read discussions more visually distinct from the unread discussions. I also suggest using the Firefox extension LinkVisitor ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2042 ) for its convenient "mark all links as read" feature.
