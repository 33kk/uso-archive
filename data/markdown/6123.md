### Description
This CSS makes the newly redesigned BBC news website look a bit more like the old one.  It removes a lot of the wasted space, improves visibility of section headings, removes the TV/Radio adverts and new mastheads and makes the site left-aligned again.  Feel free to edit out any bits you don't like/need.
