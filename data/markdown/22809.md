### Description
This style is based on Wikipedia Grey Lady II by DavidONE which was in turn based on Wikipedia Grey Lady by chochem.

I initially modified the original to just handle small inconsistencies that bothered me.  When Wikipedia made their Vector skin the default skin, I have since changed this substantially in order to fit the appearance of the Vector menus and tabs into the skin.  If you prefer using the Ajax-ish Vector skin with the auto-filling search, this will work for you.  If you prefer the older menus, first create an account on Wikipedia if you haven't already, and then select the Monobook skin from your preferences.

If you like this skin, please comment and rate.  Thanks!
