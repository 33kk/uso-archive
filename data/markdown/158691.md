### Description
A basic userstyle to make the TIGSource forums a little more readable on a phone. Probably won't work with other Simple Machine boards. Meant for portrait view; threads should look okay in horizontal aspect ratios, but the board pages will probably look dumb. (Note: currently doesn't include styling for profile pages, so the table there will still stretch & break the page. It looks okay otherwise, though.)
