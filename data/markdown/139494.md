### Description
Slickdeals is too bright. Here's a darkened version. For obvious reasons, the images will always have that stupid white square around them, cause slickdeals uploads them as jpgs, which aren't capable of being transparent.

Otherwise, a great-for-mornings look at slickdeals.net. :)
