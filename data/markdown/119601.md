### Description
<strong>Update 2018-12-22:</strong> Fixed the header, footer, and main content backgrounds. Various borders darkened.

This style applies a dark grey-ish theme, similar to how the Unreal Engine 4 Editor itself looks. The contrast between the UE4 Editor and the documentation (which is bright white by default) was getting on my nerves, so I threw this together. It's not perfect, but it does make the documentation a lot easier on the eyes!
