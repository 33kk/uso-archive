### Description
BatchBlue's social CRM, BatchBook, is the most powerful CRM I know of that isn't painful to use.  However, it's just a bit too blue for me.

This style gives BatchBook a dark, clean look and also fixes a few UI annoyances.

Why did I name it GrayBook?  Because BatchGray just sounds weird...
