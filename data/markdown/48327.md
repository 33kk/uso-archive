### Description
As of June 1, 2011, Fark.com is going to a new layout. This simplifies it and gives only a few menu options and only shows the news stories and links - no footer, right column, etc. Ad removal is not complete; I use AdBlock Plus for this purpose.

Update: 6/2/2011 simplified code and kept up to date
Update: 9/25/2012 a mix of mine, plus style # 48650 from Drathus
Update: 4/30/2014 updated for Newsmax and WTFark
Update: 4/9/2015 updated to block additional containers, rearrange sidebar links, remove reference to Foobies.com, new screenshot
