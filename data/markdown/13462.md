### Description
Essentially I removed a lot of the junk, non-needed for simply reading articles.
However, since I'm very new to this CSS-, html and what_not stuff, I can't get rid of the 'secondary_column',
marked by those 2 red vertical lines. In reality, you almost don't see them, but still, some people could find
it disturbing. And btw., I'd like to know/learn as well what rules to use, so if someone can help me out....

 And please excuse the bad image quality, but it should be enough to just compare/recognise the changes made.
Any comments welcome, and please adjust to taste and screen size.
;)
