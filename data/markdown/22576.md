### Description
Menu buttons, and bookmark folders, will have white drop-marker arrows.
(Drop arrow image URIs copied from user 18195's style 19021.)

The code only works on items placed on Bookmarks Toolbar, although I've added the option to expand the effect to all toolbars. 
(Some Firefox themes have their -own- styles for menu buttons on the -Navigation- Toolbar, and I did not wish to override anything. So, by default, that part of the code is commented out/ disabled.)

Created for personal use, but please report any issues with toolbar buttons, alignment, extensions that aren't affected by this (and should be), etc.

Edits:
 ` Removed code for buttons on the Menu Toolbar. (OK, not removed, but commented out)
 ` This style now ONLY affects toolbar buttons with a menu IF they are placed on the Bookmarks Toolbar. (by default)
 ` If you want to make it work [again] on menu buttons on the Menu Toolbar, un-comment lines 13-15.
 ` If you want ALL toolbar menu-buttons to have the white drop-markers, un-comment lines 8-10.

I apologize for my egregious over-use of the hyphen character (-) in this description. ;P
