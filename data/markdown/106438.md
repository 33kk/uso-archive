### Description
im new to userstyles, lets get that straight.this is my first style and there may be bugs.While using kickass.to for past few days i have noticed the "searched term" div getting over sized and taking the whole line, and pushing other text in the next line.This style just corrects that.If u dont have that issues this style will be useless to u.Thanks
