### Description
(This style has been replaced with an all-in-one Greasemonkey script at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/66717 , which saves having to have both extensions. You can still use this style with the old script.)

The pool view of Flickr groups show medium size image previews. Requires JS from http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/66669 to switch images to medium size, while the CSS hides thumbnail images before the page loads to reduce download times.
