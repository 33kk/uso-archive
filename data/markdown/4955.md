### Description
Link to the Non-Rounded version (this IS updated for the new site design):
http://userstyles.org/styles/28563

This style is broken since wiki changed their layout.  I've done a new stylesheet at the posted link, but it's not rounded.  If enough people shout here, I'll redo the rounded stylesheet to reflect wiki's new design, but I am not planning on it right now.
