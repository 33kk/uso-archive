### Description
This style cleans up the new Gen Con forums a bit by:

<ul>
<li>Hiding the sidebar and using the full width of your browser window.</li>
<li>Hiding the thread search box so you can scroll with the keyboard.</li>
<li>Making the links a brighter color of red and underlined, so they're easier to see.</li>
<li>Always showing dates and times, rather than relative times.  ("8 hours ago")</li>
<li>Bolding the name of the author of each post.</li>
<li>Making the "unread posts" envelope icon a bit easier to spot.</li>
</ul>

Each change is in a section in the style, so you should be able to easily remove/comment out anything you don't like.

Hope this helps!
