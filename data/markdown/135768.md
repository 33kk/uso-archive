### Description
This is a style tweak for the classic theme on the IGN Boards.  It fixes margins destroyed by ad placements, removes the header, footer, and most ads as well as a few aesthetic tweaks like quote colors/shadows, forum name/header backgrounds, membercard improvements, and the break in between posts.  If you have any problems or suggestions let me know.
