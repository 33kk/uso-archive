### Description
<b>This userstyle will no longer be updated!</b> Weasyl implemented the feature on the website proper, so there is no longer a need for this style.

Shows the title and username of the author on Weasyl submissions inside your submission notifications and inside the site-search and browse. Currently does not show them anywhere else. This userstyle is still a bit rough around the edges.
