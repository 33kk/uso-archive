### Description
For use with ~<a href="http://tiheum.deviantart.com/">tiheum</a>'s awesome Holo theme for GNOME Shell and GTK3

<strong>In short</strong>
Holo Theme for Firefox is a custom Stylish style that applies the Holo styled scrollbars and some of the UI elements to your Firefox for best consistency with the theme.

<strong>Usage</strong>
Apply this style onto the <strong>stock theme</strong> with <strong>Tabs on Bottom</strong>. Will NOT work with other options.

<strong>Notes</strong>
To enable the <i>Toolbar Gear</i> Firefox button style you need to use the addon <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/movable-firefox-button/">Movable Firefox Button</a> and move it to toolbar. Default is not to style it.

Also, a few elements are not yet styled with current release, since I think it looks just fine now.
Might as well add them in later updates.
