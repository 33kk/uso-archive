### Description
Bookmark folders shown without icons in BLUE, and any bookmark not in a folder would be considered special and would be shown without icons in RED.

The idea here is to use minimum real estate for Bookmarks Toolbar, so folders are used almost exclusively, and try to keep the folder names to 1-4 characters.&nbsp; I know what my folders are so they don't need long names.

This is the version for <b>Firefox 29</b> and UP and is style 101569 (101569).
The Firefox 3.6 version can be found in style 9091 (9091)

<b>&starf; Recommended Companion Styles</b> can be found in the Notes below.
