### Description
This is mostly based on how I want things to be.

--Smaller space at the top
--The bar at the top is padded smaller
--the privclass names are tighter with less space
--Things you write are green
--Things people write you are red
--No name or room name before the multiline button
--Green links
--The tab you're in is greener and rounder at the top
--Round corners for the text box
--Green text when people are talking in a tab
--Yellow text when someone tabs you in a tab
--No horizontal scroll bar when someone stretches

I think that's it :)
