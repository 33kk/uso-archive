### Description
A flat theme for the chat from the German website minecraft-server.eu.

The theme includes:
<ul>
<li> A new visual style for the chat </li>
<li> Usability with smaller screens (it won't hide anymore like it used to do) </li>
<li> A brand new mobile view that expands over the whole screen </li>
</ul>

<b>Note to mobile view: I can't control the functionality of the chat! When visiting the site in a new browsing session, the chat could be opened up expanded and most of the time this is the case. Please keep that in mind.</b>
