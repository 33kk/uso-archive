### Description
Firefox: Styles the Awesomebar (url-bar popup) menu to look more native (Windows 8), compact and beautiful. Autoresizes, so scroll-bars are history! Do give feedback on improvements, etc. If you really like it, suggest it as a default for Firefox?

May require restart.

### Update notes
• *NEW* for Firefox 48+ use style 128948!!!
• Use with style 39995 for best effect.
• Recomended on firefox 4+; for pre3.6 versions of firefox use style 17054
• Kudos to user 142430 for the one-liner implementation
<i>• If you like it please think to donate a small sum.</i>
