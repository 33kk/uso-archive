### Description
The Google Privacy (gPrivacy) extension adds a context menu that's only contextual in that it only appears on pages where the extension is active.

It can't be disabled and needlessly clutters up the context menu with an option that just opens the preferences dialog from about:addons

This userstyle hides that entry to keep your context menu clean.
