### Description
This style makes all ClipMarks menus transparent... wow!

This style improves page visibility, allowing you to see all the web content behind the transparency.

* Thanks to user 1386 for the style 10306, upon which I got the idea for this style!


Features:
+ These Menus (My Clips, My Username, ClipList Filter, Clip Tools, Sort Clips, Search, Sort Comments, Sort Calendar, Sort Collections, Sort Tags, Hovering over a username bubble popup, and any dialog content pages),  will be transparent.
+ Menus will become more opaque when they are hovered over with the mouse cursor
+ You will be able to see images and text behind the header menu (see thru) until hovered over

Works on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3

Integrates with the following Styles:
Style 11529
Style 11902
Style 11998

Clipmarks.com nav menus are also known as dv div menu clipper lists, and consist of DIV code segments
Edit the Transparency (-moz-opacity) to your liking.  Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible translucent the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!

Changelog:
1.0.0.2:
+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.

1.0.0.1:
+ Added general DialogBox content.  Now all full-popups will be transparent.
+ This addition includes items like popping your clips, or giving a pop to a clip
