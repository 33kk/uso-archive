### Description
I'm a bit annoyed by the new scroll box on the right hand column of our Facebook home page. Since I have more than 1,000 friends, I noticed that it's a quite busy area, and I don't want it feeding and scrolling all the time. I prefer having a bit of control to read and scroll as I like, just using the main area of the site. So I just removed that new box completely. It's the simplest css script I have ever written in my whole life. Enjoy.
