### Description
Removes the ads, sidebar, and footer from http://www.engadget.com/, as well as removing most of the header except for the search box and Engadget logo.

In addition, The initial pictures seen in most posts, which with most Stylish stylesheets have whitespace around them, now allow text to wrap around them , with less wasted whitespace.

Update: Fixed picture wrapping, works in a couple more cases, should work with flash videos now too, also removed some ads I missed.  If there are bullets in a post they may overlap onto the image... not sure how to fix this.

[Edit: Removed some clutter on article pages.]
