### Description
This little userstyle allows you to get the Windows 7 styled Bookmark Toolbar hover icons for Firefox. Have a look at before and after screen shots to see what this style does. Works only on Firefox, intended for Windows 8 users, may work for others too.

If you find this useful, please donate whatever you can. It helps me keep my studies going on! :)
