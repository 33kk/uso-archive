### Description
This is based on and inspired by the Fancy Numbered Tabs extension, which hasn't been updated for Firefox 4.0. The extension replaced the close buttons on the first 8 tabs with a number, allowing for easy switch using (ctrl|cmd)-#. This style updates for Firefox 4.0 and additionally adds  tweaks for the Tab Mix Plus and Better App Tab Shortcuts extensions.

I'd recommend installing Better App Tab Shortcuts, because otherwise app tabs will take up numbers, even though their close buttons aren't visible. Three app tabs would mean the first close button you could see would be number 4.

### Update notes
2012-02-23: A small fix for the position of the right-side close button; it seemed too close to the edge for me.
