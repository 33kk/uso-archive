### Description
I made some customizations to Firefox, aiming for a clean, slim and functional aero look.
Target: Windows 7 with glass enabled.
Tested with Firefox 14.

<strong>### FEATURES ###</strong>
- Clean and slim;
- Borderless;
- Translucent, without losing usability;
- Transparent Firefox button visible only on mouse hover. In maximized mode and tabs on tittle bar, only a few pixels - mouse hover on the very top left side near first tab to access the menu;
- Support for double clicking tabbar open new tab;
- Top space for aero snaps when in maximized mode and tabs on title;
- Auto-hide add-on Bar;
- Find Bar customized according to add-on Bar;
- Translucent sidebar;
- Great integration with clean customized aero themes like Shine 2.0.

Do not look so good on the desktop too white or completely black.
