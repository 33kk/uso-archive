### Description
I went to edit one of my fics today and the post literally opened about a mile long to show all 60k+ werds of it, so I realized immediately that I needed to fix it. This might not be a problem fer most, but I figured some might appreciate it.

### Update notes
Update 1: Fixed the html viewing, as well as preview. Let me know if anything werks wrong.
