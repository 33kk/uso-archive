### Description
DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS YET I'M NOT DONE

SCREENSHOT SO FAR (Since userstyles.org crops them): http://i.picresize.com/corB<p><br>

This is an extremely heavy edit of Merfy's HabitRPG theme (https://userstyles.org/styles/101273/merfy-s-habitrpg-custom-compact-edition) mainly because that's the one I happened to start messing with. I made it for myself and I personally think it looks very nice, but be aware that the CSS is a disaster and half of it is junk-code I'm too lazy to deal with lol. In other words, it may not be easy for people who aren't me to edit.<p>

### Update notes
-If you have questions or need help finding something in my weird mess of code pls shoot me a message. I may update as-needed.

-ONLY TESTED ON OPERA, but *should* also work on Chrome. I have no clue about Firefox, sorry.
