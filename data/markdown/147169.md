### Description
<h1 margin: 0; margin-before: .3em !important; margin-after: 0 !important><b>Newegg now has a built in dark theme, and actually seems to emulate much of what I had been shooting for. You can find it at the top right of the page. As such, I will no longer be updating this skin, and it will likely break.<br><br>A darker theme for Newegg.com</b></h1>
<p><b>User Customized Values Available:</b></p>
Change "darkness" (Opacity) of all images (Default: 0.75)
Change color of; Links, hover over links, and visited links.
Choose to remove ads<br>
<br>
<br>
Feel free to comment if you like the theme, have suggestions, or find something that needs to be fixed. If I missed it, chances are I don't navigate to that section of the website. (Or I broke it by adding/removing things and didn't notice!) <br>
<br>
Enjoy!
