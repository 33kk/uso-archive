### Description
This fixes a minor issue with the wall on the new facebook design: 
If you force a larger text size on websites (like I do) the day heading (eg "August 15") will be slightly larger. 
As this heading is floated (float:left), and the stories are NOT cleared, the first story below that date will show indented so that its left edge is slightly to the right of the date.

This style clears stories, so fixes the problem
