### Description
Reformats the full episodes page (http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes) so that it can be opened in a smaller popup window, moved to one side and kept playing while you browse other sites.

Works best with this bookmarklet that opens the page in a popup:

javascript:(function(){window.open('http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes','','width=808,height=518,scrollbars=yes');})()
