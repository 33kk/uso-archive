### Description
This is a simple theme to make GBATemp a bit more eye pleasing, especially at night. 

You must set your Forum Style to TempStyle DARK for this theme to appear correctly. An easy way to do this is by scrolling to the bottom of any page and clicking on "TempStyle" on the bottom left of the page footer.

I assume if you're looking for a theme for this, you already know about the TempStyle Dark and want it darker. This theme does exactly that. Enjoy everyone.

Updated! Now it has an option for people who have bought from GBATemp's Sponsor. What this does, I'll leave you to look at the code yourself to see. It should be obvious.
