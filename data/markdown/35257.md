### Description
This style puts your tabs up into the titlebar. 
This saves a bit of vertical space, giving more room to web content on your screen.
In theory, this should give you a Fitts Law win, but there's currently a Firefox bug preventing it from working correctly. ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581858 )

Since you now have less horizontal space for the tab bar, this style also gives the currently selected tab a bit wider minimum width, so you can read page titles a bit easier.

Notes: 
You need a somewhat recent version of Firefox 4.0, to get the Firefox button working correctly.
This currently only works on Windows Vista/7, as drawing in the titlebar hasn't been enabled for any other platforms yet.
You need to do some customization in your browser or else things get ugly with this style: 
   1. Enable Tabs on Top. 
   2. Disable Menubar.
