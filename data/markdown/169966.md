### Description
Sets a dark theme on the instructions panel of courses. They already use a dark theme in the code editor and console, For some reason the designer(s) over there decided to use a single light panel which is super blinding and distracting while trying to learn. Codecademy devs, take notes. Implement this upstream please.
