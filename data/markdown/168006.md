### Description
Rethemes the scrollbar across the entire browser, wherever -webkit-scrollbar is used. Work exclusively with Chromium based browsers (Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Chromium,  Edge Beta, etc).

Note: Does **NOT** work with Firefox as Firefox does not use -webkit-scrollbar

Inspired by MacOS and friendly to both light and dark themed sites by being a shade of grey.
