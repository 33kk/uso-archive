### Description
This version is for Firefox only, you can find the Chromium version here:
style 55726
The main menu and search bar, is fixed, so it stays even if you scroll, it's minimized and expands on hover. Sidebars are fixed, they wont move either.
So when you scroll the only thing that moves is the main content section.
