### Description
Hides the "Compatibility Warning" from showing on the Extensions (Addons) Manager.
The warning reads: "Add-on compatibility checking is disabled.  You may have incompatible add-ons." and shows up when you use Extensions such as Nightly Tester Tools or Mr Tech Toolkit.

Additional Information:
- This style only hides the compatability warning.  All other Extensions List warnings WILL still show up (such as restarting your browser ...)

Browser Versions:
+ Works on Firefox3 (Developed specifically for Firefox 3)
+ Works on Firefox2

Integrates with Style 7739

Additional Information:
This Style has been tested on multiple Firefox Themes, and has worked perfectly on each.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Added an Author: row to the style's description... For some reason I forgot to add it.
