### Description
This style makes several changes to the Yahoo! Fantasy Baseball 2009:

-- The "League Notes" section is moved to the bottom of the page, which in turn brings the "League Standings" table to the top.
-- Many of the links have been restyled (in particular, the navigation and standings links).
-- The "Fantasy" fly-out menu has been shifted to the left; on screens with lower resolutions, it would open off the right of the screen.
-- The poorly-placed first link on the nav bar ("Baseball '09") has been removed so that the "League" homepage button comes first.
-- Highlights your team in the "League Standings" table in light yellow rather than light gray, which barely stands out at all.
-- Many other minor changes which are too numerous to mention.

(This is an overhaul of my style 6918 style from 2008.)

Check back for updates and please feel free to leave feedback.

Update (4-7-09): Fixed the front page so the Standings table doesn't keep moving up and down.
Update (4-9-09): Compatible with Greasemonkey script "Yahoo Baseball Player Status Changes".
