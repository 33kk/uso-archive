### Description
This is an alternative to my popular Outlook clean up. This just adds a little style to outlook. Gives the solid boring colored top a nice mixed color and changes the whole overall background of the panes to a slight off yellow. That particular part is still only testing, but seems to work correctly on my outlook.
