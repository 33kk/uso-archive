### Description
This is a simple Facebook theme, without bright colours and it preserves the default Facebook's layout.

I particularly don't like themes/mods that change totally the way the site looks, I think it lets the site uglier and isn't pleasant to use every day. But I don't like much the way Facebook like originally either.

So, to solve these problems, I've created my own theme, I think it got pretty good and I want to share it with other people.

<b> The main feature is the simplicity. </b>

Hope you like. Enjoy.
Sorry for any misspelling. ;)
