### Description
Modifies the colors and fonts on Yahoo News sites to make them more readable on screen, with a dark background and clear fonts for news items that are usually small.

Removes unneeded parts (which is subjective, but you can reenable what you need by removing inside the code, as css items are documented inside the code)

Asus EEE PC (or small screens) users can use this stylesheet and adapt it to the width of their screen by uncommenting two lines inside the code.

Updates:
* 2008May04 : Removed upper right advert on main page
