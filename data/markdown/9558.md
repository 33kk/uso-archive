### Description
When Firefox 3 launched one of the first things I did was install the awesome Glasser extension.  The only problem is that it looks a little... unfinished.  That, and Vista defaults toolbars to a really ugly pale blue color that clashes with everything.  As such, I headed over here to see if anyone had any comprehensive fix.  I couldn't find anything that really did what I wanted so I made this.  I've spent a fair amount of time tweaking it to my liking and figured someone else out there might like it.  Enjoy!
