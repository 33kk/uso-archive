### Description
Yet another dark google style.

since i like my styles very clean i stole a bunch of ideas of the styles floating around and put some own code inside.

thanks to the original coders, hope u dont mind...

i know there are some things that i could have done better, but hey, its just for me... maybe someone likes it anyway

bc screenshotsize is limited to 75kb heres the preview...

oh ya, i couldnt figure out how to prevent "moz column count" breaking divs... ull notice it in some search results...

update 07/13: small "fix" for page numbers in right corner...
