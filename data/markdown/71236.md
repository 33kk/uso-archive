### Description
hack of Facebook - Dark Shiny Transparency [with Options]
removed silver "linear -15 degree fade" from post backgrounds and most of the highlight shadows. now you can move the cursor w/o the screen flashing like an alarm. hopefully this will be included as an option in future versions of the official version. no ownership claimed.
