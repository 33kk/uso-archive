This style was suggested to me by Desi911... Thanks everyone for the feedback.  I am pleased to create custom styles from your feedback!
Works best on dark themes.

Applies to:
- File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus
- Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)
- Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)
- Right-Clicking on a tab
- Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)
- Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane

Browser Versions:
- Works on Firefox 3
- Works on SeaMonkey

Additional Information:
* Make sure you don't use a menu-color that conflicts with your image.  This is a warning, as this is an almost global UI style, so don't complain in the ratings, just choose a good color / picture combo!
* You may have to disable some of my other styles for this style to look right.
+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has worked perfectly on each.

Also Try:
+ Style 9864
