### Description
Have questions, comments, suggestions? Email me at finaux@gmx.com!

I've been working on another 4chan CSS, which means this won't get updated often, or ever, I haven't decided yet. Check it out here!

*LOOK OVER HERE* 
*MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YOUR THEME TO 'TOMORROW' BEFORE INSTALLING THIS CSS.*

My SECOND stab at a custom CSS for 4chan.org. Feel free to add anything, and let me know if you make any improvements, so I can update it in later versions. Modify any way you see fit. Built off of Midnight Caek, please check him out too!
