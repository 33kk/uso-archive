### Description
I've made this skin with the idea of a better dark theme for PokemonShowdown, it's made in a sort of "simple" style without complicated games of shades, shadows and colors.
It includes changes to almost anything, from the homepage to the teambuilder, the ladder, the battle graphics, etc... etc...
It also includes animated weathers and different backgrounds, animated terrains are coming soon too!

This skin is a project i'm working on in my free time and it's not 100% finished, many things are still to change and refine, so if you have any suggestions, questions, bug reports, etc. feel free to let me know :]

P.S.: if you want to change the pokemon near your name just open the code (by clicking on the pencil) and change the url at line 29
