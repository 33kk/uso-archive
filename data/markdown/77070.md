### Description
After a huge theme change, tweakers has become what everyone has feared, a useless bunch of padding and retarded "user friendly" controls.

I have changed the style myself, hope you guys like it.

Bugs:
-User bar has flaws. I moved it up, but the effects are harder to edit than I thought. I'll update it somewhere later

If anyone will be using this and finds a bug, report it and I'll try to fix that shit ; )
