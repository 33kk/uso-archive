### Description
Makes tabs and toolbars follow GTK2 theme on Linux, like in Firefox 3.
Based on style 43607.

style 50950
style 88901

Update: I have switched to SeaMonkey, so I will not support this for Australis, sorry. And since Australis introduces many non-native elements, like new icons and pop-up menus, this will not be very useful there. Those who want native look on SeaMonkey, see this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/gnomerunnergtk-revived/

Update 2: It seems the style works well with Palemoon.

### Update notes
Tested with Clearlooks, Nimbus, Equinox, QtCurve, Ambiance/Radiance themes.
Works with PaleMoon, Firefox 4 or any newer version.

If you use tabs-on-top, disable native toolbars.

Known issues:
App tabs look weird in tab overflow.
