This is a improved version of my other Style but uses backdrop-filter:blur(); Also it does not look like on the Screenshot just add it to see it. For this to work you need Chrome or Opera or Safari and in Chrome and Opera you need to enable the "Experimental Web Platform Features" flag (see Status on http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter ). For Chrome go to chrome://flags then Search for (CTRL+F) Experimental Web Platform features and click enable. You might have to restart but then this will work correctly.
