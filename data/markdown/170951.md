### Description
A dark theme that changes the default color on beaten cells.

Taking inspiration from the Pink Corruption theme from Kid Sheldon and building on top of the Dark theme from Grabarz19, I added beaten and overkill colors for corrupted, magma,healthy, void and empowered cells. 

I also changed the default color for the MEGA books on the map, since it always was hard on my eyes when they were on a corrupt cell.

Due to the color I choose for the beaten healthy cells, I changed the default cell you're at to a yellow similar to the light theme one
