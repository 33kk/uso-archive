### Description
Another in the "Scores in Sidebar" series for tracking live sports scores in the sidebar. It shrinks the relevant data to 300px, just right for the sidebar. The larger the screen the better it looks.

Updated for 2010.

I use it with a modified version of style 1633. If you can't get it to work properly with style 1633 leave a message in the forum and I'll post my modifications.

To use this you will need to create bookmarks to

http://scores.nbcsports.msnbc.com/fb/scoreboard.asp and/or
http://scores.nbcsports.msnbc.com/cfb/scoreboard.asp

Right click on the bookmark and check the "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" box.

22 August 2010 - Updated.
