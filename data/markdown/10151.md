### Description
part 1 is found here style 10150 and is required to receive the final result in the after 
screenshot

The Bauhaus ( #96 on the list ) font is here ( http://www.typenow.net/b.htm ) and Here is a address to a video on how to add new fonts ( http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1504726/add_new_font_in_seconds/ ) 

Anyway these 2 styles together change:

* Layout
* Font size and style ( Bauhaus )
* Remove flashing toolbar ad and most borders on all elements
* Rounded rss , category header, and tab buttons
* and more 

I originally made this because sometimes my eyes find it quite irritating staring at a white screen.
Made to my liking but open to any requests or changes desired.
Constructive criticism is also very welcome.

Feel free to change or alter in any way !!! Style has no Boundaries !!!
Enjoy and happy torrenting
