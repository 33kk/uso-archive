### Description
This stylizes the specialized "right-click menus" in the browser-based RPG Kingdom of Loathing.

Q: Umm... the -what- menus?
A: There's a setting in the game that enables a context (right-click) menu for names in the chat pane, your items/equipment, and more recently, the "quick-select" for your character's familiar.

Q: Which context menus are affected? 
A: The KoL ones, NOT the one for your operating system or your browser.

Q: I play KoL, but I don't know how to enable the right-click menu...
A: Click "account" (right next to "log out" at the top), which will open Account Management.
   Under Right-Click Item Options (toward the bottom), check-mark each option that you want enabled.

Refer to the screenshot to see how the "RCM" is styled.
