### Description
For some reason both Zazzle and Cafepress decided at about the same time to change their webstyles to light and hard-to-read and most people don't care much for it, so this CSS changes back most of the links on the Cafepress back-end from light green to a nice readable dark blue, changes the background to white, and makes the headers more readable. I hope it works for you and you're more than welcome to make additional changes to share.<br>
V1.2 - This latest version eliminates that annoying bouncing banner ad at the top of the page so that working on the backend won't be quite as aggravating.
