### Description
Roxio recently changed the look of the support forums - fixed width, bright orange/gray colors with a little blue mixed in here and there etc.  Not to my liking.  So I tweaked the colors to a 'Burnt Orange' theme that minimizes the impact of the bright orange icons. 

I have removed the header and footer so that just the forum data is visible.  I'm not going mess with the calendar because I never use it. Nor am I going to fuss with hover colors on the links at this time.

Please let me know if I missed something.

Update January 07, 2009:  Roxio just did it AGAIN!  I have updated the Stylish code but you'll need to block some of the images with Adblock too.
