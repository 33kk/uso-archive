### Description
A custom made dark mode for Progress (a school site for schools owned by Thorengruppen AB). This will probably not work anywhere else!

To edit colors, hit Customize Settings. I DO NOT recommend changing anything but the schedule and possibly unread message colors, or it might look very weird. If you accidentally changed them, the defaults are: Light - #525252, Medium - #414141, Light - #313131.

Feel free to use this as much as you like. If you want to make a new theme based on this one, feel free to do so as long as you give me some credit :)

It is also customized for TIS schools since the original logo has black text and isn't transparent. To change to your school's logo, just edit the URL in the .logo CSS class.
