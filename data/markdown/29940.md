### Description
[Updated for HtmlView mode and added techbus domain.]

I prefer to read my Safari bookshelf in HTML mode, but the corporate styling is dull, and the use of expanders on <pre> elements should be punishable by death.

These styles spruce it up a bit.

The styling of the pre blocks could use a bit more color...
