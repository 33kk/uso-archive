### Description
Usage: Only applicable to HT-standard-theme. Do not use with simple-theme, it will look horrible! Will cause horizontal scroll-bars if screen-resolution has less than 1280 width. Some icons are addressed with [title="..."] or [alt="..."], to make those icon-replacements work in your language you have to exchange the german-language title for the text that appears in your language when hovering (mouse-over) that icon. (It works without, but it looks better if you do it)

The width also causes the Foxtrick-HeaderFix to look buggy on my skin. If you want a fixed header, use 

style 17272

instead.

This Skin changes colors literally everywhere over hattrick, provides a simple set of medals, gets rid of rounded corners, makes the whole page more compact (reducing the amount of scrolling especially in forums) etc.

Thanks for everyone uploading to userstyles.org, I have used code from nearly everyone I guess (to many to individually name you all, but THANK YOU goes out to you if you spot your code within mine). Feel free to use my code!
This is version 0.5.3 (latest update 16.11.09: wider ht-live) of my Black'n'Green Hattrick-Skin. And some day there'll be a more readable code with english and german-language documentation-comments.
