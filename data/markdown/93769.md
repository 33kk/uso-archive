### Description
It's different than the "Night Mode" on Tickld, as this is not only darker, but more thorough, and most text is either grey or green. Also, I try to keep the ads off the page (they change the tags all the time).

Please let me know if there are any issues with it, I will fix it ASAP.

Also, let people know about this- I'd like to see how the general Tickld community takes to this :)
