### Description
A Trello theme inspired by Ansel Adams. Trello Ansel makes use of a largely monochrome color palate and uses slightly reduced margins, padding, and typeface sizes. Translucence is used sparingly for a fresh feel, but the styling remains mostly flat and modern. Trello Ansel themes even the details, including labels, progress bars, user badges and buttons.
