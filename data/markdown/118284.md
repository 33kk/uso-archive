### Description
i don't like their "HeartBeat" system , specialy how it appear suddently without explanation.

I use their  reporting and telemetry functionality.
I think is more useful than this marketing stuff..  

And since their last updated versions , Firefox became more or less like an "Google Chrome", 
without it take care our advise and let us to choose how to customize it.

By example, Read here :
