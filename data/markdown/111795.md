### Description
A <b>raikou~suicune~entei</b> based CSS made for Pokemon Showdown servers, this css is already used by another server</u>, even tho I changed this one from the original in the battles.
PS:Pokemon Showdown has an old sanitizer, so I can't put the battle css in the original css file for the server, as it would not work and it would freak out.
If you see any error or something that looks weird, please PM me in a server such as <a href="http://origin.psim.us/">Origin</a>
