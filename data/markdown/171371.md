### Description
Make it wider! A style for wide screen resolutions, where Facebook page has big side margins leaving empty, unused space on your screen. Designed by default for my 1600px wide screen with chat list open – but you can choose other widths, too (should work for *modern* browsers…).
BUT remember – it's static. Doesn't adapt when you change the window size. And it won't.

BETA version, please comment.

BE AWARE:
"(Stylish does not yet support updating styles with settings, but will soon...)"
