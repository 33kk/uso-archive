Additional Information:
* Make sure you don't use a menu-color that conflicts with your image.  This is a warning, as this is an almost global UI style, so don't complain in the ratings, just choose a good color / picture combo!
* You may have to disable some of my other styles for this style to look right.
+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.
