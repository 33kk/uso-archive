### Description
Adds a Touhou picture to the background (or your very own!) and makes all the sections dark transparent.  Also adds HD monitor support to YouTube.  More info below!

### Update notes
UPDATE 8-29-2017:

As Youtube has updated its layout nothing works.  It'll take me about 2 weeks to get the style working for general viewing and search purposes.

As I don't upload content to Youtube, please bear in mind that the content upload pages will not look correctly with this skin when v4 is released.

Old info:
<b>If stuff doesn't load properly a good refresh will fix things.</b>

<b>For some reason, during my tests I found that any picture bigger than 200kB uploaded will mess the entire script up.  If you want to upload a file bigger than that, please use a file hosting site and choose the "Provide your own" URL option.</b>

Due to css3 compatibility limitations, make sure your browser version is not horribly outdated.  Chrome works fine and theoretically, recent Opera versions should work too.  On the other hand, my Firefox tests have turned out to be quite annoying.  Only <i><b>Firefox Nightly</b></i> works, <b>but</b> you have to go to the about:config page (just type that in to the top navigation box) and set layout.css.filters.enabled to true.  If you don't have Firefox Nightly and you set this setting to true, all the icons disappear :(.  I guess until the main branch updates, Firefox will have to deal with darker icons.  Sorry! :(

Since this is an HD skin, the recommended screen resolution is full 1080p (1920x1080).  Other resolutions should work, but have not been fully implemented or tested yet.
