Changelog: http://michaeltunnell.com/feedly-mosaic-userstyle-changelog

Feedly decided to kill the "Mosaic" (Grid) view from v14. This style resurrects the Mosaic view by replacing the Card view.

"Mosaic" was my preferred view when I wanted to display items that contained pictures because it provided a nice display with a grid layout of items while at the same time not wasting any space with clutter. Cards on the other hand wastes a ton of space and is mostly clutter. I decided to revive Mosaic and make it a happy medium between Google Reader's minimalism and heavy visual apps like Flipboard or Feedly (now).

Default Views & Item Counts
Cards = 6
Magazine = 5
Timeline = 5

Grid View (Mosaic) = 12+
Mosaic Responsive = 20+
