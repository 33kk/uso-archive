If you've always dreamt of mastering The Force, well this will not help you. However, if you want to have some discrete but beautiful style modifications for your YouTube player, to watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailers, you're on the right side of the Internet! 
Wait, do you prefer Mace Windu's fancy purple lightsaber? No problem! Just use the settings below to customise your style!

  ・ 1.1.0:
