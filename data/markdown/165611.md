### Description
<strong>Hey! üëãüèΩ</strong>

Dark Twitter++ is a simple dark mode for Twitter that works regardless of whether you have the old or new design that also works well with <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/155039/a-better-twitter">A Better Twitter</a>.

Tell me if anything isn't themed properly, or hard to read; I'll be sure to fix it as soon as possible!
