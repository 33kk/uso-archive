### Description
A charcoal and yellow theme for FurAffinity.net, designed to enlarge otherwise smaller text, dispose of the banner, and provide usability improvements that result in the site looking a bit more modern until as such time the staff can be bothered to roll out new styles that were promised half a decade ago.<br />
<strong>Important note: This style works properly when the basic Dark theme is selected on FurAffinity. ponybells can only do so much with fixing the spaghetti there.</strong><br />
<strong>DOUBLE IMPORTANT NOTE!</strong>: Vaunt Dark will NOT be rewritten to work with the new beta layout for FurAffinity. Much of what Vaunt Dark was written to fix is either fixed in the new layout, or could potentially be fixed as feedback is being given to the beta design group. Vaunt Dark will continue to focus on the Classic style.
