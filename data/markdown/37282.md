### Description
<b>LATEST VERSION: style 82074 </b>

In June 2010, Flickr made some radical design changes to the photo page that were, on the whole, excellent. There were just a few things that bothered me, which I described here:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/4731650184/in/set-465611/ This stylesheet fixes the following:

(1) Reinstate title above photo
(2) Keep the 'photostream' film strip permanently open. (It's currently hidden when you come from a different context, such as Contacts or Favorites.)
If this is all you want, install my other stylesheet: style 37228
(3) Some Flickr users also missed the button bar above the photos, finding the 'Actions' dropdown menu cumbersome. This stylesheet also reinstates the button bar.
