### Description
ROTIX changes the ROBUX icon into the Tix icon. Most instances of ROBUX are changed into Tix. This does not change how the ROBUX currency works, it just skins it to make it look like tix.

Roblox, the Roblox logo and Powering Imagination are among ROBLOX's registered and unregistered trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. All instances of '?' in the screenshots are text that was changed into a '?' because they can be modified at any time.
