Fixes various UI elements on Firefox/Pale Moon so that they look and work correctly on Windows 10.

### Update notes
Using a theme on Firefox or Pale Moon on Windows 10, and finding that the window frame is broken? Or, if on Firefox 40+ or Pale Moon 26+, that the caption buttons no longer work? No problem! This style will fix these issues for you, making it possible to use your favourite theme still on the new OS. Simply select the browser version in the dropdown, and you're all set!
