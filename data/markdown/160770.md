### Description
This theme applies an Arc-Dark theme to the html pages created by the info2www cgi script on Linux.

It's an unusual one to be sure, and I'll be shocked if anyone ever actually downloads it.

For those unaware (Probably most people including GNU/Linux users.) Dwww converts man pages to html, running as a cgi script on a local http server. For info pages, it calls info2www. Dwww uses css which can be customized, but info2www does not. 

It's short and simple, and should be nice and easy for anyone to edit.
