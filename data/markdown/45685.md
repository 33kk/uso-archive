### Description
Removes the button style from the buttons in the navigation toolbar (of the default theme) in Firefox 4.
This addon doesn't work correctly in Firefox 13 (and even earlier perhaps?), but <b>button style (border) was removed in the toolbar in Firefox 14, so it's not needed anymore!</b>
