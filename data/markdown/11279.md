### Description
Removes the following from movie review pages:
-trailer/picture galleries
-'buy DVD' links
-'Latest News' module
-featured on RT modules
-forum links
-user reviews

Also clears out most of the RT ads. 

I've also removed nearly everything on the homepage out of personal preference, but you should be able to modify that pretty easily--I think I've labeled the code well enough. (You can find a screenshot of the modfied homepage here: http://www.imagebam.com/image/27c4f515749236)

If you have any questions/comments, please shoot me an email at:

ETA 21.04.2010: Updated the code a bit to reflect RT.com coding changes; will be tweaking more throughout the summer.
