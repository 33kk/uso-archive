### Description
Slightly modified from https://userstyles.org/styles/106386/tinyboard-dark-patterns, forces font family of choice and uses a minimalistic grey pattern as a background.

### Update notes
Update 1: fixed the boards-page, added a field to use custom font families. Just type your font family of choice on the field, and make sure that one is installed on your system.
Sans-fonts work well with this style, I personally use Fira Sans.
Update, April 2015: Applied for new elements
