### Description
This code has no theme to it. It is exclusively fixes for the online Yu-Gi-Oh! simulator Dueling Nexus, so it works better on mobile devices. However, it should work just as well on larger displays as well.
Please send me feedback @Yubelious!#5584 on Discord. If you are making your own CSS theme and would like help, or would like to help others test and write their own themes, please consider joining our Dueling Nexus Unofficial Development Extensions server (DM me on Discord for invite).
