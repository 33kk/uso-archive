### Description
<p>Twitter's Timeline is pretty great, but the left sidebar is annoying when you're browsing in a smaller window. Responsive Timeline solves this and other issues by making Twitter more responsive to changes in window size.</p>
<p>Features:
<ul>
<li>Hides the left sidebar when the window gets too small.</li>
<li>Keeps the search box at its full width all the time.</li>
<li>Ensures the horizontal scrollbar isn't shown when it isn't needed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
