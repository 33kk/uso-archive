### Description
Uses style 8755 by user 2857 as its base. Makes the theme a bit softer and smoother for less of a "neo" feel, and more of a charcoal drawing. Changes to the original Neo below:

- Main background is now more "charcoal" gray color instead of black
- Content text now light gray
- Link text changed to darker blue and added lighter blue hover color
- Changed font to Verdana and sized down to 11pt
- Expanded content page to 80% page width
