### Description
replaced by style 7589 (which is firefox 3.0 RC1 compatible)

A lot of work went into this - if you appreciate it, please support my work.

v1.2.1 - transparency edits
v1.2 - finally, script updating is back.
v1.1.3: urlbar tweaks, mostly; some page fixes; fixed findbar
v1.1.1: statusbar fix; added new go-button image
v1.1: lots of bugfixes; misc changes, added search-go button back in per request
v1.0: initial release

makes urlbar rounded and transparent; gives more vista-like menu effects; fixes some visual discrepancies in glasser; makes elements more transparent (back, forward etc).

Show rounded text fields, menulists and more in Firefox 3
Includes webpage fields and multiline fields
shows blue hover and focus for all fields (vista-themed colors)

I've integrated parts my vista statusbar and findbar theming upon (many) requests;
also shows solo images (if you click "view image") centered, shows wider google results (full-width) - all easy to comment out if you don't like them.

Only tested on Windows. Please post screenshots and post in forums for bugs.
====>IMPORTANT: Unfortunately, it is impossible to code a CSS theme that works right on both windows and linux. So, this is a WINDOWS theme. For a linux theme, please see vbielawski's style 6463.
