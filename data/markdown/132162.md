### Description
Dark blue theme for 4chan. I have hidden all of the bloated Adblock/Announcing stuff.
CSS contains Finnish commenting (i will translate them to English in the future).
To use this theme, you will need Stylish addon. Works best with Yotsuba and Yotsuba B styles.

If you find anything that needs tweaking or is broken, please comment and i will fix it!

Screenshots are compressed, so quality is poor.
// EDIT: New darker background for replies
