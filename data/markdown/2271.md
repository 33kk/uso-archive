### Description
Changes the "improved link style" on MSNBC.com to be closer to the old link style. In my opinion this new link style is terribly unreadable - these style rules make it more bearable. NOTE: styles have not been exhaustively tested, nor have they been tested in a browser other than Firefox 2.0 / Windows XP. This is the second version, which has been tweaked to only affect the font on the links, not on some of the regular text.
