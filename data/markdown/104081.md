### Description
stops the header bars from sticking to the top of the screen when you scroll down on feed pages (home, trending, and subscriptions). hides the tab bar completely on the subscriptions page, since i rarely use it to switch to home or trending.
<b>note:</b> this is for the old YouTube design and will not work for the 2017 Material redesign.
