### Description
This hides the amount of comments, statistics, message centre, moods, and favourites (not the actual comments) from as many places of DeviantArt as I could find.

Note: This removes the statistics from the right hand side of a deviation, quick link to your messages, statistics button on deviant pages, and some functionality on other parts of the website. Use as needed.
