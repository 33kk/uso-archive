### Description
A fluid high readability version designed for wide screen monitors with higher resolution.
Larger font, stretched to fill screen, dim and shrink the sidebar, minimize the breadcrumb bar, move the URL to the end and dim, and dim the article toolbar.

Sidebar has mouseover.

[8/27/10] The new digg code is very clean, its very easy to make these changes.  My first run though in a hour or so.
