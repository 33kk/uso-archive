### Description
This aims to provide an accurate color scheme for the new Vanilla Plex Forums that matches the old Plex IP.Board Forums. Please note this is still a WIP and will change as things are further polished.

The script makes the forum discussions take up the width of your page vs. the new column style. The script also highlights unread categories and topics and highlights those with new columns. Please feel free to comment with any suggestions! I lurk around the forums often and provide support there.

If you find the skin useful and enjoy it please consider a small donation.

### Update notes
There's an optional javascript plugin with this that allows for some additional UI enhancements.
