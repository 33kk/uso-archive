### Description
These styles can be used in the SerialsSolutions Client Center to make it easier to deal with. 

So far it only makes one change. Know that little box inside the page where you have to scroll if you have a long list of results? No more. Use your keyboard (or the mouse anywhere on the page) to scroll through your results.
