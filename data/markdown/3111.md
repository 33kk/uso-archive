### Description
just my user.css for heise.de.
i made it for opera, but it works also with stylish.

the removing of ads works fine, even a bit better than in the other cleaner here (ads in the articels).

the outcommented part with  the bigger fonts seem to have no effect in firefox, if someone knows the reason, please let my know.
