<p><b>[v1.3]</b> - Mar 19th 2016</p>
<p>Rebuilt due to Facebook updates. Sorry for the delay! Completely changed CSS.

<strike>Now the reason behind my delay: I had to go low-profile in a way. Facebook changed how the "reactions" worked shortly after I released the language update and when I had a look they sort of made everything a lot harder to select (refer to) in CSS. Count this update lucky, they made 1 mistake that nearly made this Style lose many features. Until then, enjoy :)</strike></p>
