### Description
An updated version of my Idealo style 
The new colors should make it look more pleasant to the eye.
The default colors make it into a duotone-black&white-dark mode style.

You can edit the colors in the CSS editor at any time (I provided a tutorial in the code so youÂ´ll know what to change)

It goes hand-in-hand with my "Coal on fire" color theme for Firefox 
(You can download it here or search for it on the addon store -> https://cshort.org/YLSun30K)
Note:
Contains little to no bugfixes
