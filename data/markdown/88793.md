### Description
As the name implies, I did this style to watch videos in Youtube without distractions, so the video box is a little bit bigger and centered, the right sidebar with recommendations is gone and the comments to the video are also gone. The description stays under the video.

These styles work best in combination with "Black Youtube by Panos".
