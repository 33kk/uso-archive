### Description
Statuspanel displays in a fixed position in the lower right corner of the screen. Colors, edges and size have been modified to be less obtrusive. Screenshot shows before and after applying style for direct comparison. Arial font recommended. NOTE: Statuspanel will not automatically move when hovered. This may interfere with the selection of a very small percentage of links.
Inspired by a userstyles discussion. http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/26253/statuspanel-style
