### Description
It's a fix for all persons who watch videos on YouTube with a desktop resolution of 2560x1600px and with the browser on half screen like me.
Generally, the greatest width for the videos is 1280px. If you have the browser on half screen it has a border right and left and you can't see all of the video. This stylesheet will fix that and resize the window.
