### Description
The Trimps Gradient Theme, but beaten Corrrupted cells become Pink.

Note: This theme now requires that you enable the in-game Gradient Theme in settings to work. Other than Corruption, the CSS for this theme and the official theme is identical, and having to only update the in-game version is much easier than updating it and this together.
