### Description
Proper screenshot: http://imgur.com/nxVXsar
WARNING: This is just to show how it looks! It doesn't seem to work well in Chrome at all! This style is actually kind of crap until someone codes it properly (you're free). It only works in Theater Mode too, as I couldn't bother to make it for normal mode. YouTube is soon redesign its look, so this will soon go in the trash too, but look how AMAZING it has been looking! Isn't it awesome?
