### Description
Change the size of the video titles on Youtube

### Update notes
2019: Updated, should work. Didn't test.
___
!!! Please read:
For me Youtube seems to have removed this giant title text size and as of that (assuming the change will stay) there's no point in this userstyle anymore. I might delete it in a few months.

Makes you configure the size of the font above recommended videos.

Default size: 19px (big and fat, hard to read)
Recommended: 16px (smaller, I prefer that)
Old size: 14px (seems to be the old one)

Otherwise: If you want a different font size than avaible above, just go to the list of all Stylish' styles and edit it. It's just 1 line :)
