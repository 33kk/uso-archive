### Description
Makes the entire sticky notes website dark.*

*(no longer, now it only themes the part not already themed)
If you want the full dark theme, just get the Tampermonkey script that enables it => https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/Tampermonkey-Scripts/raw/master/Microsoft/Sticky-Notes-Dark-Mode.user.js

### Update notes
Loading screens, additional button menus (not related to Sticky Notes), and login screens were manually themed by me.

Additional Notes:

4/22/2020 - I'll no longer be updating this with the Microsoft theme changes, I'll only be updating this with changes that Microsoft hasn't implemented to make the website full dark. See the description for instructions on where to get the full dark theme working.

4/24/2020 - I've removed iframe theming for favor of javascript url setting to alternate link with another hidden dark theme Microsoft has for the help pane.

4/30/2020 - I've included a temporary fix for image position when viewing a note with one image. (Microsoft will eventually fix that, I hope)

6/23/2020 - I've included a temporary fix for bullet points when used in a sticky note preview. (Microsoft will eventually fix that, I hope)

8/03/2020 - I've moved styling for Microsoft logins into its own style now. Check it out at https://userstyles.org/styles/169528.
