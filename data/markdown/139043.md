### Description
Dreamhost has a pretty nice looking custom control panel, but their User Profile pages are stuck in 1995. Wrote some pretty complex styles that make the User Pages look like the rest of Dreamhost. This is about as close to a pixel-perfect match as I could get : )

### Update notes
Beta v0.72
To add your own profile pic, provide a link to an image above. A 140px wide image currently works best.
