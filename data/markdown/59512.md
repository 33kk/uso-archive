### Description
Simple style that provides a flexible left/right columns for Gmail. The left column with labels, etc. is set to 25% of the browser width with the main column taking up the remaining 75%. Very useful if you have labels with longer names or several nested labels.

The widths can be tweaked in the style settings if the defaults are not exactly right for you.
