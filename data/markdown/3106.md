### Description
Removes the adverts from the ctrl-alt-del site and reformats the content to use the space that gets freed up. On non-comic pages, the main box is resized to fill the entire width and on comic pages the comic box is moved into a more central position. 

Works both with and without AdBlock and fixes the misalignment that using AdBlock normally causes with the header.
