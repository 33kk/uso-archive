### Description
This style is short, simple, and relatively useless. All it does is, when you visit any page of deviantART.com, remove the underlines from links.
I wrote this because I think underlined hyperlinks are ugly as hell. :B

Edited so links in signatures appear a shade of blue, but still not underlined. :D
