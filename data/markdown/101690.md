### Description
Just some tweaks I made because I didn't like tweetdeck's default style, I did it for myself, but I'm sharing in case anyone cares.

This version is for hardcore people and it is a modified version of my own other thingy here: http://userstyles.org/styles/97578/tweetdeck-moar-flat-design-no-scrollbars

Changes:
- No animations
- Modified style
- Everything is now squares (no rounding)
- Almost everything takes less space
- No scroll bars (still scrollable via mouse wheel)
- CHANGE ALL THE MARGINS /o
- CHANGE ALL THE PADDINGS /o
