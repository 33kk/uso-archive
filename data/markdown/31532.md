### Description
simply hide sidebar, logo, and login stuff.  gains you some vertical real estate too.  It brings article all the way to the left and all the way up.  the after screenshot shows me using this script in conjunction with firefox's text-only zoom capabilities.  i did not include any font size formatting in this script so that you can use your own level of zoom.  you may not want to use this script without zoom because there's much more space when you remove the sidebar, but see for yourself.
