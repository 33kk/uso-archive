### Description
This is a work in progress style that cleans up the forums on Arstechnica.  After years of viewing the same green I decided I needed a fresh look even if they weren't going to ever get around to it.  Hope someone else will enjoy this too.  Note: I definitely just threw this together and do plan to clean up some of the buttons and inconsistencies.
