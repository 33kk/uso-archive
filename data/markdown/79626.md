### Description
[DISCONTINUED]
Displays Youtube new design in a more convenient and simple. There are little details that make it more comfortable surfing the site.
Content is centered as it was in the previous design. It is an experimental version that I used to learn CSS. I will be adding improvements. If you see any bug, please report it to me.

Best regards & thanks for download!
