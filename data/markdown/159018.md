### Description
A fork of the excellent "Dark start.me" by birb-naise...

My goal was to extend start.me's native dark theme options to the rest of the UI elements that are still bright, and to add some cleaning touch ups. birb-naise's dark theme does most of the work for this already. I've basically just removed the portions that were darkening the widgets (which can be dark-themed natively), and fixed some breaking changes in start.me's latest updates.

It's a quick and dirty hack, honestly, but feel free to make use of it!
