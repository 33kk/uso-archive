### Description
Kills all the pointless white space on either side of bracket and the bracket description when looking at a tournament's bracket page. It will use the full width of your screen, with only 20px padding on either side. This doesn't block the ads that normally take up that white space, it just hides them from view after removing the space it's supposed to be in.
