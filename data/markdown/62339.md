### Description
Fx 13.0a1 and later:
Just some new-tab modifications (with much larger thumbnails than the default).
For 1440x900 resolutions, however, <strike>and requires a refresh after dragging or rearranging thumbnails.</strike>
Thanks to user 61655, the dragging and rearranging now works.
Should work on Fx 12+.
