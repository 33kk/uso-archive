### Description
Foreword: This style is meant to be used in tangent with Jökulsárlón Download Manager: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/j%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n-download-manager/

Jökulsárlón Download Manager allows the default download manager to be inside a tab. 
This user style simply gives it the same look & feel as the Firefox 4 Add-ons Manager.

Many parts of this style are pulled directly from chrome://mozapps/skin/extensions/extensions.css so its license has been included.
