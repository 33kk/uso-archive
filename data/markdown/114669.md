### Description
Firefox has the new reader mode (about:reader) to facilitate reading of (almost) any article in a simple, pleasant, constant style. However, the width of the article view is remarkably thin for a single column. Meh... change.
This styles allows to customize the width of the view but also to use a layout with more than a single column, making it more akin to a newspaper.

The image shows the 5-column view on a display with 2560px width.

### Update notes
Update 2015-06-12:
* Added multi-column option. Default is 3 columns
* added setting to show dashed column separation lines
* increased default width to 90%
