### Description
Turns any button placed into the tab bar into something that looks like an inactive tab except shaded differently.

Tested on Firefox 4 beta 6 nightly on Windows 7 Aero. You can use this style to simulate a home button in the tab-bar, at least until they implement something better (by the looks of the roadmap, that won't happen anytime soon).
