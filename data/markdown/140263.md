### Description
A lightweight userstyle for Firefox Australis XUL (tested on v52.0) aiming at making the tabs square (similar to Edge) and denser.

### Update notes
I chose to make this style in order to make actually <em>working</em> (at least on FF 52+) and <em>nice</em> square tabs - all the alternatives seemed to play badly with my current FF and some other addons and styles. This is a style appliable to vanilla Firefox and it's easy to override.

The style also provides an option to pick "tab width mode" (allowing you to make tabs even as small as just the icon) and subsequently minimum width of the tab.

The tab label/content <em>spacing</em> is also configurable.

This userstyle is licensed under CC0, though attribution is appreciated.
