### Description
This style makes a few slight changes to the scribble.wreally.com webapp home page. These changes are:
 - makes the corners of notes rounded.
 - removes the "Click to add new note" note.
 - removes the "Try Scribble Sync" message.
Notes can still be created by clicking the "+" button.
