### Description
Based on <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/117673/darktube">DarkTube</a>, this style adds YouTube Gaming's palette to YouTube making it darker, including shadows (material design effect) and scrollbars. It also fixes the "Purchases" page and the search suggestions, which are broken in DarkTube.

Install <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/126443/youtube-gaming-scrollbar-for-youtube-firefox-only">THIS</a> style on Firefox to theme the scrollbar on YouTube, for Chrome see the "Chrome scrollbar style" setting below.

### Update notes
<b>LATEST VERSION: <big>v1.1.8</big></b>

<b>BIG NEWS:</b>
This style is now superfluous, as youtube implemented a native Dark mode: visit this url (<a href="https://youtube.com/new">https://youtube.com/new</a>) and enable the New look, then click your profile picture in the top right corner, and finally enable Dark mode!

To do: 

 ● Some pages under Creator Studio are still white-themed;
 ● Find a way to make the top loading bar more similar to YouTube Gaming's one without glitches;
