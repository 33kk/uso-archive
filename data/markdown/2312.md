### Description
My first attempt at Stylish is to make the PinoyExchange BBS (which runs a version of the vBulletin software) more palatable. This style uses warm colors from the "sandy stone beach ocean..." kuler theme by ps. It also hides the generally huge list of users currently online. The HTML generated by vBulletin is basically old style HTML 4.0 so I was a bit limited in what I could do.
