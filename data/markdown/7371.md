### Description
[N.B. (2009-09-12) Steelsheen's comment below -- Yes, this style was a hack, I'm aware that some link colors don't work on black (as well as other things). At the moment, I'm not using the style at all -- I use a greasemonkey script that inserts a link under the photo to the bighugelabs.com/onblack.php web page script for that flickr photo page.] 

This style creates a black background for Flickr photo display pages with the URL prefixes flickr.com/photos and www.flickr.com/photos.

The style also increases the border around the photo and borrows (with changes) most of the excellent style 2197 by user 2385 to decrease the opacity of text and other elements on the page.

I still don't have a real grasp of CSS, so this style is subject to continuous updating as I try to find the most minimal changes to get the effect I want. Comments most welcome.

The result demphasizes the other elements on the page, leaving the photo front and center.

2008-12-1: I've copied and pasted the enhancements suggested by user Matvey in comments on this style which clean up loose ends in my quick hack. I still need to minimize all this style's CSS code to the strict minimum necessary.
