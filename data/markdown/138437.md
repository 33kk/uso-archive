### Description
i just modified the site in a dark style. i have not excluded any of the elements on the site. as you can see in the screenshot, even the advertisment is still there. on some sites i just turn my adblocker of to support their work a bit. it even depends on advertisment itself. anyway i just made them a bit darker and filtered them to grayscale. so it depends on your preference if you want to block ads or not.

i mostly use the base64 decoder / encoder. but some times also other tools on that site.
