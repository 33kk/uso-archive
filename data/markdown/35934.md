### Description
I use AccuWeather.com's hourly forecast at:

http://www.accuweather.com/us/[two-letter initial for state]/[City]/[ZIP Code]/forecast-hourly.asp

to keep an eye on the upcoming temperature.  However, visually, the hourly forecast ironically enough isn't as noticeable on the hourly forecast page.  This fixes that.

You will have to edit the userstyle to reflect your personal location information.
