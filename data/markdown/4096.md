### Description
______________________________________________________________________

Completely new design! Across all Google pages (web, images, maps, ...)
______________________________________________________________________

NEWS:
First of all: thanks to all of you for the positive reviews! It really encourages me to continue
working on this style!

I don't have a lot of time to post updates because I have a full time job and in my free time 
I'm also studying to get my bachelor degree. But don't worry, my next version is coming out now! 
Most of the 'bugs' have been resolved (see updates) and I'm fixing all the other broken pages. 
I've made a separate style just for the tool bars with a consistent style across all the pages. 
Later, for each page a separate style will be available.

All bug reports, feature requests & other suggestions are welcome! 
______________________________________________________________________

Because of the large size of the script I had to split it up in multiple parts:

 • The main script (= this one) which holds the styles for the toolbars at the top.
 • style 11993: Icons for the buttons & links (also works without Google Aero! installed)
   (will be incorporated in the main style soon)
 • Web & Image Search: !!! COMMING SOON !!!
 • style 11989 
 • style 13332 (currently on hold)
 • More will follow! (iGoogle, Reader, Docs, Picasa, ...)
______________________________________________________________________

There's still a lot of work to be done but I will try to post updates & bug fixes regularly!
