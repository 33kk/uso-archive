### Description
<strong>IMPORTANT -- SITE REDESIGN REQUIRES YOU TO SCROLL DOWN AND USE "ADVANCED STYLE SETTINGS" BEFORE INSTALLATION!</strong><p><em>As of May 9th, there is no way to revise your initial selection through this page. If you didn't get them the way you want, unfortunately you have to completely remove the style from the Add-ons page, User Styles section, and then reload this page and choose your style setting options again.</em></p>

<p>Use Courier New for Cyrillic (and other Unicode characters beyond the normal range) in the Firefox address bar to help spot phishing URLs.</p>

### Update notes
For proof of concept phishing domain, see: https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/ 

** Let me know what other font options you would like if your platform doesn't use "Segoe UI" by default. **
