### Description
Color theme, turns all the standard and some add-on about:-pages dark.
This works mostly with inversion filters, so it should not be affected by changes of those pages that much,
but it also means that it will un-darken any about:-pages that are already dark (due to other user styles, add-ons, system themes, ...).
Requests to add additional add-on about:-pages are generally welcome.
