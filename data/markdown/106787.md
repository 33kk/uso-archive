### Description
It's perfect for browsing at night on pc or phone. It saves your melatonine from the screen's blue light. Makes you sleep better.
Also saves battery on oled/amoled screens.

I tried to make everything visible, yet dark and smooth looking :) 
Mainly made it for myself and uploading it to use it with firefox mobile.
Feel free to report bugs that makes pages unusable so I can fix them! :) Thanks!

### Update notes
Update: fix new youtube


Firefox users should remove /* AGENT_SHEET */ from top.

The base of this style were these styles: 
- https://userstyles.org/styles/94925/night-owl-browsing-dark-global
- https://userstyles.org/styles/96324/dark-global-brown

Thank you very much Mishime and Geiser!
