### Description
This style gives vampirefreaks.com a super mario feel.
seriously! =] I really like it.

most colours have been changed to a light blue and green.
links are white - New cult posts are shown as mushrooms ^^
the top boys/girls have been taken off the main page.
The featured news/ interviews etc have been removed.

menu0 is STILL there, its just not in the screenshot sorry >.<
but its colour has been changed to make it suit the style more!
the default font is also smaller to help fit more things in! =]
An there's a cool new vampirefreaks.com logo!

its very different from the default - but if you're a nintendo freak it might be worth a look! =]

Thank incident for this style!
