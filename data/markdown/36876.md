### Description
This is a combination of tab hacks:
1. No title text (just the icon)
2. Favicon is larger
3. Tabs are round instead of square
4. Unselected tabs are dimmed

Note: To center the tabs, right click on the toolbar to customize your toolbars in firefox and just insert a "flexible spacer" to the left of the tabs. This centering has nothing to do with the style itself, its something you can do in firefox without editing the style
