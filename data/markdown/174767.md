### Description
Black YouTube Theme by KMV.

Consider this theme "Clean".
Most colours are B/W until hovered.
Designed to be easy on the eyes - most distractions have been reduced to a minimum.
Works straight out of the box - no "Enable YouTube Dark Theme" again.

Note:
I do not have a YT account, so there are likely elements within user account-pages not covered.

Features custom cursors, -scrollbars, subtle opacities and gradients, hover transitions on Menus, Buttons, Logos and Popups.
Dark Theme on reCAPTCHA & YouTube Login page included.

All options in separate codes. Delete any of these to disable.

Main Player is untouched to accommodate for the many custom interfaces available.

Optional Video Dim (-25% brightness);
