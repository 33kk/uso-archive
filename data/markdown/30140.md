### Description
Simplistic light gray redesign of the Wikipedia site.

This removes much of the editing links and options as well as the sign on stuff. Basically it's for people who just view articles.

I'll try to keep this updated and probably make some different themes in the future. I'm open to suggestions and let me know what you think.

*** UPD 062710 - Removed white bar across the top caused by a recent update to mediawiki's tag id naming scheme.
*** UPD 121310 - Updated for international support. Should now work for all languages.
*** UPD 062212 - Updated for minor CSS inconsistencies featured in Firefox 16 Alpha build. I will upload the previous script as <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/67935/wikipedia-gray-simplistic-compatibility-mode">Wikipedia - Gray, Simplistic (compatibility mode)</a>
*** UPD 030413 (and forward) - See Additional Info section.
