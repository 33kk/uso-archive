### Description
This is NOT a full userstyle. I made this only to darken what Radzo73's Dark Curseforge doesn't. I've included in-line comments to label sections code.

Technically, I kinda stole CurseForge's CSS to tweak it, but that's a necessary evil, right?
I've probably missed some elements. I may or may not come back to this to work on it.

Credits:
Thank you Radzo73 for your rad UserStyle!
