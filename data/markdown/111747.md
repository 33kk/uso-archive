### Description
This userstyle makes Workflowy more "distraction-free" like.

!UPDATED 2016/5/8!

Workflowy is definitely the world best outliner, but can't say perfectly suited for writing long articles or literary pieces. This style makes it better by hiding bullet points and helps to insert more flexible line-breaking.
Of course it doesn't spoil great function of Workflowy. Just hover where the bullet should be, then shadow of the bullet will appear and you can use D&D moving and pop-up menu as usual.

You can customize look & feel by changing options below but it's set as a usual WorkFlowy by default except bullet color. So if you don't want change the colors or sizes, pass through them and just press install button.
