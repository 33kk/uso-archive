### Description
Wikipedia - bolder inline cites.

This style increases the size and boldness of Wikipedia's inline citations. Adapted from "Wikipedia - fainter inline cites" derived from code by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mzajac. It works on the English, German and French wikipedia domains.

This style sheet modifies the appearance of Wikipedia articles such that inline reference cites will appear 140% larger, in bold, and will become yet more prominent when you move the mouse over the paragraph that contains them. This is intended to make it much easier to find and click on them. This performs almost the opposite action of "Wikipedia - fainter inline cites".
