### Description
This is a dark theme for the digital marketplace known as Google Play.
I noticed the lack of Google Play dark themes on Userstyles, so I decided to make my own.

This style will not be skinning Play Music unless there is a large demand for it; There are already many other styles for this. I recommend Google Play Music Black [October 2018] by macfeaster. https://userstyles.org/styles/135830/google-play-music-black-october-2018

This is the first style I've written from scratch. Please do not be too harsh with your responses, and please offer constructive criticism.

I will attempt to fix as many issues as possible as I'm made aware of them, but there may be some issues that I cannot fix, and for this, I apologize.
