### Description
This is a Dark Style for How-To-Type.com.

Important: If you're having issues updating this style first uninstall it,
then reload the page and install it again after selecting your settings.

I highly recommend using Stylus over Stylish for both Firefox and Chrome and other supported browsers,
mainly because that is what i use for my browsers when i create these styles.

Here's a link to the add-on:

<a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/39LlrOz">Stylus for Chrome</a>
