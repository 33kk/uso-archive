### Description
Steam's "Just For You update" introduces a lot of new things - including a pixelated, noisy, and frankly low quality looking background. This simply replaces it with a much smoother version.
This does not apply to the same thing on the background of game pages, Steam has some pre-generated overlay thing going on instead of just having the blue background at 50% opacity over the game image.
