### Description
This style is suitable for people who 
love monochrome interfaces and that 
suggesting more sobriety.

My priority was to maintain good 
functionality and not to let disorders 
the elements. This mistake happen 
when the focus is the visual aspects only.

My main goal was to modify the tiresome 
and annoying blue default facebook menu bar. 
I tried to make the code small and simple 
but quite efficient for its purpose.
