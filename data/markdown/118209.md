### Description
If a label has text (defined in Card > Edit labels > Crayon icon for each label), the text will appear on the card, not just the color. When the text is larger than the width of the label, the label will expand to show the full text.

### Update notes
If you haven't set text for labels, no text will appear. Set the text for each color label under Card > Edit labels > Crayon icon.

This style is based on the style Trello Label Overrides.

<strong>Updates</strong>

august 10 2015: made compatible with Trello slim.
september 3 2020: the text was still hidden. Now the label text should be visible. When the text is larger than the width of the label, the label will expand to show the full text. Other minor features have been removed.
