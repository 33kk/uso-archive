### Description
Made so my eyes don't explode whenever I come across an XDA post link.

Note that this will be incovenient and will break things if you use the forum for literally anything else other than just viewing posts. Viewing profiles and replying to posts is broken.

Also note this doesn't save you from horribly formatted posts. Can't do much about that.
