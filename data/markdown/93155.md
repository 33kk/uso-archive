### Description
The favicons of certain sites have a dark figure over a transparent background, which can be hard to see with a dark theme like NASA Night Launch.  This stylesheet adds a bright background to the favicon shown in the browser tab for certain sites known to need it.  (Currently: the New York Times, the Register, the Daily Mail, the Washington Post, GitHub, the Dissolve, and certain Mozilla sites.)
