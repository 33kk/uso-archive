### Description
This style is meant to be used in conjunction with one of the following userstyles:
style 36723: For the more subtle redditor.
style 36724: A complementary selection of features.
style 36722: With all the bells and whistles.

This style is already incorporated as an option in:
style 36717: Choose your very own! (Firefox + Stylish only)

This style moves the right sidebar down below the top bar, to give the top bar more room.
If you do not have a lot of vertical space, and you want to see the extra tabs added by RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite), this style should help.
