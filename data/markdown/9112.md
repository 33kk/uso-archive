### Description
Turns Last.fm blue.
Suggestions on improvements are welcome. If you do make a suggestion and I decide to use it, I will put your user name down along with what you contributed. If you would like to remove the globe from next to the language selection link, uncomment the section under "Remove Globe".

First style for stylish, so go easy on me. ^.^

Companion Greasemonkey script: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/32236
 ^ Changes red globe image to black[white] globe, attempts to change music player background color.

Note: Because they're using a sprite, you can choose from their black and red themes and get different looks. With this style applied if you use the red theme, the header will look more flat; if you use the black theme, it will look more round. I personally like the round look, but I'll leave that choice up to you.

Changes now listed at this blog post: http://ben-deepthought.blogspot.com/2009/09/lastfm-paint-it-blue-userstyle.html
Comments accepted there or here, but I'll be more likely to respond quickly if you comment at my blog.
