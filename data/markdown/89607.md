### Description
This is a dark theme for The Old Reader (theoldreader.com). 
The blue used is the same shade used in Android (as specified by the Android Style Guide).

You can add your own static images (to replace the top left logo, or the search and 'add' icons).  To do this, edit the style's CSS (in Stylish), point to your hosted image(s) in the very top section, and uncomment the very top section.

This style is probably not perfect; there may be unhandled page elements, etc.
