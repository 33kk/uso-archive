### Description
This style removes Amazon's ads to external services. Those are the boxes that say "Advertisement" under them. As an Amazon Prime member who buys a great deal of things exclusively through Amazon, I got tired of seeing flashy ads on every page when all I wanted to do was find and buy something. This style does not remove ads for Amazon's own services, such as ads for items for sale or the Amazon credit card.
