### Description
My Youtube Resizer 

It renders the video player at 980x550 which is perfect for me.

This style can be used alone 
but was originally meant to be used with Valacar's style 1078  


***UPDATE***___8/16/2009
This style now works with user profile and channel pages
***UPDATE***

***UPDATE***___10/17/2009
