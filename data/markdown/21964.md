### Description
This is my version of style 22367 by user 16191. 
Instead of specifically using KDE icons, it should work on a wide range of Linux distros, especially those that use the GNOME desktop. 

I created it on an Ubuntu installation, using the Breathe icon set (the icons you see in the screenshot).

It goes without saying that this won't work on Windows or Mac OS.
