### Description
In JIRA Cloud the 'Issues' sidebar includes a large collection of filters that not everyone uses don't use. For example (Open, Done, 'Viewed recently', etc.). 

These can't be deleted, removed, or reordered.

This custom style removes them all- you can then define your own filters, which- if favourites, will appear in the sidebar.
