### Description
I did this quick and dirty update following the Spetember 17th update of the IGN Boards.  It's not optimized, documented or complete but it's a start.  It works best with the "Grey" scheme IMO but works okay with the "white" scheme but does not work with "Classic".  Use at your own risk.  I'm just sharing.  When (If) I get it like I want it, I will do screenshots and comments but until then, feel free to improve it.
