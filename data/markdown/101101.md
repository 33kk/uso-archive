### Description
The original Basecamp applied a yellow background to tasks that were assigned to you. This is missing from the Basecamp 2, and can make it hard to pick out your tasks if you have many long lists. This style applies the yellow background again, but requires a little digging in order to find your unique user ID used by Basecamp under the hood. You can also apply colors for other Basecamp users.

### Update notes
<b>Set Up</b>

The following instructions assume you are using Chrome (instructions for other browsers or improvements to these welcome!):

<ul>
<li>Right-click on a ToDo task that has been assigned to you and choose <b>"Inspect element"</b>. (This will open a panel at the bottom of your browser with the part of the HTML code you selected highlight.) (See the associated screenshot above for reference.)
<li>Move up from the selected line one element at a time until you encounter the first <code>&lt;li class="todo show" ...&gt;</code> element.
<li> Inside this tag will be a <code>data-assignee-code="p1234567"</code> attribute. Make a note of the "p" number in quotes (including the 'p') as you'll need that to configure this style. (See the associated screenshot above for reference.)
<li>Navigate to this styles homepage (if you're reading this, you're already here.)
<li>Enter your <b>pXXXXXXX</b> number into the <code>data-assignee-code</code> box, and if you want, change the background color.
<li>Click <b>+Install with Stylish</b>.
</ul>

If you participate in multiple projects owned by different accounts, you may need to repeat this process for each one. (That's why multiple <b>data-assignee-code</b>s are provided.) You could also use the extra codes to color other users' tasks differently.
