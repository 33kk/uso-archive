### Description
A bunch of Reddit users keep complaining that since the domain amazonaws.com keeps having server problems, the stylesheet that forms the arrows and logo at Reddit goes away and it screws up their whole day.

Silly, silly Redditors.  The "Arrows" are just beckground images, put behind linkified areas.  All we have to do is assign those areas spacial dimensions and background colors, and they never go away, and remain functional.

Use your own colors for the arrows if you find mine to... shall we say... loud?
