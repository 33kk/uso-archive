### Description
While this theme was designed for http://www.ibdof.com it should be adaptable to other V2 sites that use a standard subSilver template.
Notes are contained in the code explaining each section, and what you may have to change for your site of choice.
20071217 - added missing color setting for 'h1', 'h2' tags
20080212 - fixed missing comment closure in section.2 [table.thHead row hover]
20080623 - fixes for FF3 (some input & button issues)

Have created a few Greasemonkey scripts to go along with this.
replace subSilver images - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16314
**OR** {20080213 - see @whatrevolution's comment for an alternate (better!) image solution} **
reformat index.php page - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16201
reformat main-menu - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16199

** NOTE: The "after" screenshot shown is a result of all the above. **
