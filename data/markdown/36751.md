### Description
This style eliminates the gold and silver medals on the avatars of subscribers. You can still hover over a user's avatar to determine if they are a subscriber.

It should work on all five Whiskey Media sites, but not their mobile editions (as of September 15, 2010). Further research into the mobile sites is necessary to make sure it works as intended.
