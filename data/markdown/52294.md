### Description
The way Amazon was coded sucks. Their CSS doesn't cascade so its pretty time consuming to make an Amazon theme, so there aren't many. I think this one is pretty decent. Makes Amazon a nice dark gray and doesn't remove any necessary images like other userstyles.

Note: you can easily change the colors of the links and background etc just by finding the first entry in the section such as #MYCOMMENTORANGETEXT. Change #ffa658 to your preference and boom, brand new look.
