### Description
Style returns Ravelry back to some of the visual softness that was in the prior version. Less contrast buttons as well as outlines and the return of the soft green.

This theme can be used with the following Extensions: Stylish and Stylus(recommended) for Chrome, Firefox, and Kiwi Browser(Android) and Cascadea for Safari on Mac only. Install your extension first and then come to this page to use the Install Style button. You can come back here to also update your style when I push an update.

If you have any suggestions please reach out to EWM on Ravelry via the following project page.

### Update notes
V2.6 - 8:50 am PST September 2nd, 2020
Fixed a font color issue on the Stash Page navigation. New code by officials was implemented that took priority over my code resulting in impossible to read navigation. New code implemented may be affecting other areas of the site but I have yet to determine if there are any other areas affected. If you notice anything that is colored oddly while using my theme please let me know right away.


V2.5 - 10:20 AM PST July 11th, 2020
Fixed a minor issue that affected the main site spacing.

V2.4 - 4:10 PM PST July 10th, 2020
Major update that should only affect Ravelry Pro only. For those using Ravelry Pro please let me know if there's any residual issues. This should not affect the main site but if you see any problems please let me know right away. 
 
V2.3 - 10:10 am PST July 1st, 2020
It was brought to my attention by @cheekyimp that the footer bar in the forum had changed resulting in incompatibility with my theme. I have updated the font color and changed out the cyan 3 dot icon for a gray equivalent. 

V2.2 - 12:pm PST June 28th, 2020
In light of the Ravelry Statistics being unable to determine whether a person is using New Ravelry with or without a theme I've decided to include the Classic Logo into this theme so there will no longer be a secondary theme. The Logo files are stored on the Ravelry servers on my Project Page as such any time you go to a Ravelry page with this theme that file will gain a view. I hope that this may prove to be helpful for the Ravelry team to grasp how many people are using this theme. 

As always if you spot any issues with this theme or notice anything that could use some fixing up please let me know via Ravelry. My username there is EWM. 

V2.1 - 1 pm PST June 26th, 2020
- fixed a few locations where white was still showing rather than #fbfbfb gray
- sorted out the animation element to the navigational tabs so they are now static.

V2.0 - 12 pm PST June 25th, 2020
The official Ravelry team has made the front page animation static unless you push the play button. In light of this change I've removed my code that removes the clouds which I was unable to figure out how to stop their animation. They have also mentioned that they will give the community a 6 month warning before they retire the Classic Ravelry rollback option. I will continue to make updates and adjustments as needed during this period and beyond as needed. Please feel free to reach out to me via the Project Page or via Ravelry PM. 

V1.9 - 1:30 pm PST June 23rd, 2020
A small but very important update
- I found out I could control the animations on the login page. I have gone ahead and disabled all animations on the login page. I also cleaned up the login box. 
- Some official fixes were done with the forum and I've removed my fixes since those are no longer needed
- more white space fixes

V1.8 - 2:50 PM PST June 22nd, 2020
A relatively small update
- Fixed a Magenta button of my own creation(sorry!!!!! I used that bright color to help me spot them better on the site to determine affected locations) Thanks [m4ndy](/people/m4ndy) for alerting me about this.
- Fixed some margin issues to reduce excessive white space
- Replaced a few more cyan instances with green

If you spot any issues, have questions, concerns, or think something needs some attention please let me know!

V1.7 - 11 am PST June 21st, 2020
This update mainly pertains to the removal of extra white space.
- Reduced white space on the forum, designer portfolios, and notebook pages
- removed cyan hovers for calendars and search

As always if you find any issues or things that need more attention please either leave a comment on the project page or send me a PM.

V1.6 - 1:50 pm PST June 19th, 2020
Sorry for the very small update. I was having a hard time tracking down how to remove the cyan from selectable fields. I finally got it and wanted to push this very minor fix through. 

V1.5 - June 19th, 2020 12:15 PST.
This is another major update. Several fixes in place to remove harsh lines and cyan background coloring. The Ravelry Team has provided a rollback feature under your profile icon in the header. This will allow anyone to see the prior version of Ravelry while the Ravelry team are working on making fixes to the new version. I will continue to provide updates for this theme though as I want everyone to be able to enjoy and get the hang of the new UI which is actually quite fantastic. 

- adjusted line-height back to original 1.4 em in a few locations 
- replaced black outline for certain tables and boxes across the site with a gray outline
- replaced a ton of instances of light cyan with either light or medium Ravelry green(if you spot any bad visibility with these OR if you spot remaining cyan instances please let me know)

The following fixes were made by @Momijizukamori. Thank you so much for your help in fixing the following! Your tweaks look awesome!
- fixes the ‘my notebook’ menu
- makes the boxes on the search page nice and rounded
- puts the search page buttons inline
- fixes hover colors on the menu
- changes fonts to be less tiny
- makes links not blue

V1.4 - June 18th, 2020
Major update! This is probably the most coding I've done to update the theme of the site yet. There were several very tricky to narrow down coding so it took me a bit longer than I had hoped to resolve some of these things. 

Thanks so much to everyone who provided great feedback and suggestions!

- removed and replaced several black lines in various locations
- fixed up navigation in the header and several subheaders to reflect older style and substituted harsh underlines with more subtle colors
- removed light cyan in several locations and substituted with light green
- changed color on several multiple advanced search buttons
- removed more box shadows!
- restored font to its former glory
- substituted yellow hover in the main forum area for the light green
- fixed some hover issues

As always if there's something you'd like to see changed please leave me a comment and I'll see what I can do. Make sure to update your style in whatever extension you are using to ensure you have the latest version! Also in good news the Ravelry team removed the Cyan Pop Art Reply buttons! YAY!!!!!

V1.3 - June 16th, 2020 (ok I lied this is the last update for today)
- with the gray background update it conflicted with the forum borders which I felt caused readability issues. 

V1.2 - June 16th, 2020 (last update for today but I'll continue to make changes so keep an eye out!)
- updated forum hover to the former more subtle yellow
- adjusted some areas with black orders to a more subtle gray
- adjusted overall sight to very light gray instead of white
- restored original site font style and size
