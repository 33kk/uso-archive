### Description
The concept was to create an eye friendly fb theme with a lively and clean character, based on the power of colors rather than flashiness.
Blue/red is a very common, somewhat boring, and even stern color pair. With the right kind of shades it's what I find the most expressive, uplifting and subtle one.
<ul>
<li>Full theme – more than 99% of FB is styled in detail.</li>
<li>Kept optimized and to the point to compensate the heavy load of styling.</li>
<li>Updated regularly.</li>
</ul>
