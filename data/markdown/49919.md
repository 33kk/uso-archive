### Description
This version makes the previous Cleaner FriendFeed (http://userstyles.org/styles/18334/cleaner-friendfeed-05-29-2009) a lot cleaner! Cleaner FriendFeed focuses on the user's content more than the web application itself, removing noise and clutter and making the user's feed more focused for the viewer.

Some quick notes: This userstyle brings the FriendFeed conversation to another level by instantly letting you knowâ€¦
1) Your own comment (Powder Blue color)
2) Your friends comments (Light Yellow color)
3) Your non-friends comments (Normal FriendFeed Comment Color)
4) Likes (Light Pink)

To use this, simply install Stylish on your Firefox (http://bit.ly/fBOyUW) or if you use Chrome (http://bit.ly/jLwLFW).

Happy FriendFeeding!
