### Description
A revamp of the first version of Google Crown Theme, http://userstyles.org/styles/66225/google-crown-google-login-screeen?r=1337986848.

Themed "Google - Simple Log In Page". 
The theme is based off an anime called "Guilty Crown" which is set in year 2039, that's why you see the odd year on the copyright string. 
'Undertakers', a resistance group fighting against the government. 

I wouldn't recommend using this theme if the resolution 
is lower than 1280x(1024), nor higher than 1980x1080 -due to the background.
