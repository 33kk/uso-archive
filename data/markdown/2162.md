### Description
Sidneyboy -- Can you post a screenshot of your problems? I can verify this works on Vista Home Premium, WinXP SP2, Gentoo & Ubuntu Linux. I wouldn't see how it would work in VHP vs VHB.

I love the new themes Google has added, but I wasn't fond of certain things (namely the input, tabs, etc) getting in the way of good artwork. So I modified certain parts of the page to be transparent so I can see all the goodies :) I am currently using the Springscape theme although this script is compatible with *ALL* of the Google Homepage Themes so far.  *Current Script Size: 3.95 KB (4055 Bytes) **(New! Check Out style 2445)**

UPDATES:
* v1.4 * 25 JUN 2007 (Minor) - Temporarily disabled the tab height I set due to some google updates
* v1.4 * 27 MAY 2007 (Major) - Rewrote/Organized code, new styling features & formatting, fixed old code.
»» * 1024x768 * http://links.zathland.net/styles/ght/preview/1/  |  http://links.zathland.net/styles/ght/preview/2/
* v1.3 * 25 MAY 2007 (Minor) - Fixed formatting misplacements caused by new code in the Universal Bar.

* v1.3 * 16 MAY 2007 (Minor) - Fixed script so the page would display right. I'll tweak more with this...
* v1.2 * 15 MAY 2007 (Maintenance)  - Several new style edits and modified how links act when hovered.

* v1.0 * 08 APR 2007 (Minor) - Google changed how the footer is displayed, so I killed the footer.
