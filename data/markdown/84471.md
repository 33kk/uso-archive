### Description
Extends gray background theme to actual feed and other page elements. Works in conjuction with "Feedly optimized for 1920/1080px". Not all elements have been styled gray (e.g. popup menus). Feed items on the left side are a bit bigger and some extra spacing is removed. Also share icons are removed.

Added fallback fonts, selected unread feed item has green title.
