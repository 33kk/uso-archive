### Description
Yahoo Answers WAS too narrow! With this extension, make it suitable for browser windows 1024px wide or more.

This style also:
Removes most advertisements on Y!Answers
Removes the large "Ask/Answer/Discover" banner
Removes the small "Ask/Answer/Discover" banner

If you would like to make Y!Answers even wider, it's simple. Just edit the style, and increase all numbers by the same amount.

Right-click and then select "view image" on each screenshot to see high-resolution screenshots.

[Updated 8/3/07]Widened the Yahoo research bar and elements on the answer-a-question page.
