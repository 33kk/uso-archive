### Description
I have no idea why those white scribbles are there... they disappear when you click on the image though.

Anyway.

This style thing fixes the avatar transparency problem that happened whenever. It also makes the subforums look terrible, but who even uses those except to create a new thread? It changes the quote and like bar background as well and it looks terrible... And it also doesn't work on permalinks. Why are you even downloading this? Just use default mode if the transparency thing bothers you that much. But then again everyone just colors their background to #C9C9C9, so you lose either way. 

This is your cue to beg David to pay someone for a better theme.
