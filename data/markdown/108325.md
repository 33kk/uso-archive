### Description
Want to post something to facebook without losing an hour to your newsfeed? Install this then hit up https://facebook.com/YOURUSERNAME?postonly to get a simple box to post from :)

It might make sense, if you use StayFocusd, to make this page allowed while the rest of facebook is limited to 20 minutes per day or whatever.

As mentioned in http://blog.complice.co/post/105218135607/5-simple-hacks-to-avoid-serious-facebook-gmail

Update: As of 12017-01-05, you can now also go to https://facebook.com/YOURUSERNAME?firstinfeed and it's the same except with the first post also visible. Reasons this is useful: 
- if you want to come directly back to the thread later (bypassing the rest of fb) then you can easily grab the link after posting
- you can leave a comment on the thing you just posted

I noticed that when trying to do either of those previous things, I would sometimes get lost into the rest of fb. Now I don't!
