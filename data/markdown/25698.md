### Description
Removes the search box out, shrinks the whole header dramatically and decreases the font size and line height of bookmarks enough to accommodate smaller screens such as Netbooks.

Also provides CSS to remove the footer, just uncomment.

OPTIONAL
------------------
If you load 43marks.com as a default home page, it steals focus from your address bar to its search bar, even though I've hidden it with this user style. This is because it uses Javascript to do so before the page has loaded. 

43marks uses the "Prototype" Javascript library's onready event, which seems to trigger before DOMContentLoaded time, ie Greasemonkey time. One way you can prevent this is to use the Firefox extension "NoScript" to disable Javascript to 43marks initially and only turn it on when you need it -- such as when rearranging bookmarks. This comes in especially handy if you use the Firefox extension "NewTabURL" to load 43marks every time you open a new tab. 

I have contacted the owner of 43marks (on Feb 19th 2010) about putting an option in the preferences to disable the search box and he said he'd ask his coders about it, so we'll see.
