### Description
Creates a narrower dashboard, with options to minimize "Who to Follow" and "Images and Videos" modules, hide Trends. Collapses the twitter links at the bottom of the dashboard so they only show on hover. Also hides the "most recently added" members from the sidebar when viewing lists.

If you want a wider timeline or a narrower dashboard or vice-versa, just drop me a message.

If you want an even cleaner look, I recommend using this style with style 61358
