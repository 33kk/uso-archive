### Description
A very light and refreshing theme for Zoho Mail in Roboto font. Other benefits:

- Monochrome colored icon on the left navigation bar. So easier on your eyes.
- More compact, so you can view more emails and folders, thus reducing the amount of vertical scroll.
- Better contrast between the unread and read emails in the Inbox list that assists you to spot the former quickly.
- Wider Folder Tree panel. Helps you to have lengthier folder names.
