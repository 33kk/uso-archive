### Description
This style override hides the contact card flyouts that appear when mousing over a name in the list of contacts shown on gmail.com or mail.google.com. These cards have a habit of always being in the way when you don't want them to be there, or otherwise covering up something that you want to see. Nothing fancy here, it just makes it so they don't appear.
