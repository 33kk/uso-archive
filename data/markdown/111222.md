### Description
Script to look like you are wearing the Eel Guard outfit clothes from Eldarya. This does NOT give you the clothes, it only changes the appearance of what you wear. Anybody from any guard can use all the styles. Currently incomplete, will be updated once completed. :3

### Update notes
Update 1.2:

Again, this does NOT give you the clothes, it only changes your appearance. This is to see the clothes on your character. To wear real clothes, you have to find or buy them and be in the appropriate guard.

In order to use, you must wear:
- Original Eldarya pink dress (free)

NOTE: This means the outfit will be on one layer only (the dress layer). You cannot move the individual pieces onto separate layers. Sorry. ^__^;


Current styles for guards:
Absynthe: Complete!

Obsidienne: Complete!

Ombre (Shadow): I am missing the entire top half. I will update after I get that.
