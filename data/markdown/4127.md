### Description
Simple modifications to make Gmail 2 more to my liking.  Hides the ads, invites, and chat. 

Has a rollover effect in message lists and hides the sideways "chevron" which indicates what the current message is.  The labels that appear to the left of a message subject are also hidden.

This is really my first attempt at creating a user style, and I don't think gmail 2 was a good site to try to get started on.  Let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, or find any problems with it.
