### Description
This style makes your 4chan look like your everyday Google+ page with its few colors and sharp edges.
The style is a copy of the original april fools css and have been modified to work with userstyles and such.

### Update notes
NOW WITH 4CHANX SUPPORT
Updated to make the catalog somewhat better looking again, since it was kinda broken by a 4chanx update.
This means to style something to replace missing HTML code from april fools that got removed.
