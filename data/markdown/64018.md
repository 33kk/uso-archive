### Description
<strong>Всем спасибо, все свободны</strong>

### Update notes
Gentlemen, here we present a little script that aims to improve G+ user experience. It removes right block with suggestions, centers the stream on page, and improves comments readability by changing background to white and text to black.

<em>Notice:</em> this script is a crutch. Deal with it.

The script is intended to be used with browser window maximized. You probably won't find it useful if you prefer opening G+ in a small separate window.
