### Description
Just a quick one i did when i was bored,is only the homepage.Was'nt going to post it,but what the hell.Feel free to expand as long as u mention me.Tips,comments welcome.

If u want to use a style that enhances search aswell with it,just delete any urls at the beginning of the search style(eg. url("http://www.google.com/"))that dont have anything after the '/'If ur too lazy,sometimes u can load the search style first,then enable my one afterwards.Then my style will be the home page,but u'll still have ur search style.Hope that makes sense!
