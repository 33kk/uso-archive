### Description
Bookmark folders shown without icons in BLUE,  and any bookmark not  in a folder would be considered  special and would be shown without icons  in RED.

The idea here is to use minimum real estate for  Bookmarks Toolbar,  so folders are used almost exclusively, and try to keep the folder names to 1-4  characters.  I know what my folders are so they don't need long names.

The Firefox 4.0 and up version can be found at style 46947 (46947)
