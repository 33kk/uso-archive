### Description
Colors the 
borders of a tab with  RED for active tab,  BLUE  for a normal tab,  GREEN for a still unread tab, MAGENTA(FUCHSIA) for loading/reloading tab.   In other words distinguishes tabs as active tab, viewed tab, unviewed tab.  Does not affect the background color of a tab  so that color usage of  "Perma Tabs"  ("Perma Tabs Mod"), and/or "Multiple Tab Handler"  extensions will prevail.   Bottom border color will show up even if tabs on the tabs bar have been squeezed down so much that only the favicon can be seen.

The style for <b>Firefox 29</b> (Fx29, Australis) is<b> style 101570 </b>(101570),  you will still need the TabVisted extension in Fx29, described below.

You must install the TabVisited extension to use this style  (see below).
