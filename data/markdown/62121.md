### Description
***SEE NOTE BELOW***
 
This restyles the newly redesigned Google Voice interface to be dark with grey/white/blue highlights (or custom defined colors) in the DeepDark style.
<br><br>
This style requires the use of the <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/120351/google-bar-dark-style>Google Bar - Dark Style theme by Devo</a> in order to style the top Google bar interface.
<br><br>
Legacy Google Voice style is now located here - <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/138121/legacy-google-voice-dark-style>Legacy Google Voice - Dark Style</a>
<br><br>
Thanks to Devo for giving me a head start on this theme.

### Update notes
NOTE: This style has not been updated for latest iteration of Google Voice web interface. Google will very likely be making their own dark theme as they've done for numerous other services and Android apps. For now, I recommend using the <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US>Dark Reader Chrome Extension</a> which I use personally and find it more than capable of creating a dark interface. Only downsides are a slight performance hit on slower machines and less customizability.
