### Description
Allows returning to top of page when hovering outside of web page document, such as browser toolbars or the Windows taskbar.

*NEW* (10.12.12) Installation option for activate upon triangle mouse click only.

Chrome users will find that this style will "delete" most of the internet.

On/Active = green triangle in lower right corner

The style is buggy, I know this. It was designed for personal use. I use it mainly for Forums. It allows me to mouse scroll and read, then quickly get back to the top, where most forums keep their navigation.

### Update notes
<b>Known issues/caveats. May/may not apply to one/both style options.
</b> Be warned, this is <i>not</i> a 'one size fits all' style:
  - Does not work for all links or pages
  - Moving between monitors on a +1 system setup will trigger the return to top
  - iFrames. Since they are their own html, behavior in an iFrame environment would have to be experienced in order to be understood. That's the brief explanation/disclaimer.
  - Arrow is not visible on all websites. Adjust style color opacity if this is a concern
  - Arrow may "jump" around or appear in multiple locations on the screen
  - Arrow style is set to lower right corner. Adjust as you see fit.
  - Applies to the entire web universe. <i>@-moz-document</i> as you see fit (I have).
  - Becomes annoying if you are not intent on using the style for the purpose it is designed (see above)

Feedback is welcome, although feedback regarding known issues already listed will probably not recieve any type of response (at least from me).
I may/may not update this style. This style will in no way be supported (see the style title for more information).
