### Description
Adapted wholly from http://userstyles.org/styles/3132 by Snakeling
This style is designed to be used with the IJ Skins: Class Adder [ http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11289 ] Greasemonkey script. Note that it will *not* work on its own.

This style works best with the Hand stylescheme, though it gives decent results on the other styleschemes.

This style suppresses the horrible banner table, which means that the layout pages will not have a search box or login status, but there is a Find link in navigation menu on the left, and you can check your login status in many other ways.
