### Description
UPDATED - 12/28/2009 - Should now work with the 'new improved version' of blip.fm with the exception of the top menu which I can't seem to set unfortunately.

Final version - Makes things black and enlarges user avatars.

(this removes the buttons on each song as they make the whole thing look terrible due to blip using white backgrounds and not transparent ones on their images.)
