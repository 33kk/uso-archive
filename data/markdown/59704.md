### Description
Pokécheck is a website which allows you to upload your Pokémon to the Internet for viewing their stats and sharing with others. Like most websites, its default theme is black text on a white background, so I have decided to reverse this and make it white text on a dark background.

All versions are now up to 2.8, which will be the precursor to an all-themes-included version 3.0.

There are three remixes available: style 59654, style 59703, and style 59987.
