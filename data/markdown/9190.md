### Description
Keeps the devART message bar at the top of your screen when you scroll.

Bugs: Had to display:none; some drop shadows. Because a few of them share the same classname, when I tried to keep the friends list drop shadow in place, the other ones (like comment parents in your message centre) had the same effects.

Update [July 31, '08]
Fixed it to not get offset to the left in dAmn.
