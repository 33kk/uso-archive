### Description
Just an evening project; nothing I took too seriously. Hell, I didn't even check how it affects browsers outside of Firefox.

This was built for use with 4chan x, but it should work without it as well. maybe.

If there's something you'd like changed, anyone is more than welcome to mess with my code however they please. Chances are I won't be updating this.
*edit* I lied, I have been updating this lately.. a few cross-browser bugs have been fixed with the custom fonts, and the opacity has been steepened. I'll look into more element customization and non-4chan x adjustments when I have the time.
