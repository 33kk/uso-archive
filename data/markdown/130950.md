### Description
If you'd like to track changes when editing stuff in WorkFlowy, you may want some visual color cues as to the corrections/ modifications made.

Read about tracking changes in WorkFlowy in this blog post:
https://blog.workflowy.com/tracking-changes

(1) TEXT DELETED (UNDERLINE+BOLD+ITALIC) - shows text as red and struck through 
(2) TEXT ADDED (UNDERLINE+ITALIC) - shows text as blue
(3) COMMENTS (UNDERLINE+BOLD) - highlights your text yellow

** This style goes hand-in-hand with the (1) "WorkFlowy Track Changes - FINAL DRAFT" and the (2) "WorkFlowy Track Changes - ORIGINAL" styles, which (1) hides comments and deleted text to show a final draft and (2) Shows the original text before any revisions:
