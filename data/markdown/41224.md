### Description
Since firefox 4 beta 9 has been released with interface improvements that mirror this style, just use this style: http://userstyles.org/styles/33773 , which is really awesome. 

To recreate the effect in this style, select silver, black, yes, fully transparent.

I am not updating this style.

--------------
It's supposed to have a nice aero glass look while not becoming hard to read or visually unappealing.

The style will make all toolbars have the aero glass effect in Windows Vista and 7.

It will also cause the add-on/status bar and download statusbar to be aero.

Tested on Firefox 4 beta 8.



To get the look in the screenshots, you'll need to:  right click on toolbar > customize > check "use small icons".

Click on the screenshots to zoom in ... it doesn't look good zoomed out.
