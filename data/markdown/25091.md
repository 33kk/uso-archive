### Description
This is a very quick and crude fix so that when a "Touchstone" is clicked on, the old menu that used to appear will show. Word of warning, it'll show two links under the touchstone after you click it.  Highlight doesn't seem to work.  I might try to combine this styleshee tweak with a Greasemonkey script to provide a more useful set of choices. 



Painful details:

So say you have the following touchstones in a list:

Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald
The Elephant Man by Bernard Pomerance
East of Eden by John Steinbeck
Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy

Clicking on 
Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald

will cause two links to appear below the title/author.
