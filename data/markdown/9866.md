### Description
This accomplishes four main functions, which can easily be changed in the CSS below:
 1) Expands line height to make the page more legible
 2) Gets rid of all ads... COMPLETELY!! Even those "Social Ads" which are kinda creepy in the first place
 3) Changes font to Calibri, if you have it (Tahoma if you don't)
 4) Removes the suggestions which Facebook recently started making. Seriously? I don't need to reconnect with my SISTER!
