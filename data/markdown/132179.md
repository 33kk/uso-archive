### Description
<p>I wanted to make a theme that would of been easy on the eyes while sticking close to home.</P><br>
<p>I do believe i have achieved that. I made it within chrome and that is what I'd recommend using for this theme.</P><br>
If I forgot about something please let me know. :D 
I hope you enjoy this theme as much as I do and I recommend using CriAzuDre's CUSTOMIZABLE WAVEFORM HUE https://userstyles.org/styles/123974/customizable-waveform-hue
