### Description
This changes the background of the live games and computer games to a nice image you can specify with the configure setting.(default is space)

Also makes the board for the line preview larger so you can see it clearer. (default 2x)

### Update notes
Scaling the preview board for the lines in analysis to more than 1x increases size but remains the same resolution so looks blurry when scaled up too much.
