### Description
Restores titles to pictures in DeviantArt galleries with color customization options.

DA Classic (Discontinued by DA): Adds a red border around you-know-what images (like FA). Looks best in my opinion with <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/160557/nocturnal-deviantart-theme-fork-sta-sh>Nocturnal Theme Fork</a>
DA Eclipse: Formats the favorites/comments like classic DA, and has nice hover effects.

Feel free to steal (fork) it and make it better

### Update notes
V1.8
-Moved outlines to another element to fix on Firefox??
-CSS for classic site off by default because it's discontinued by DA
-Changed hover offset back to 55px

V1.7
-Fix after DA changed class names YET AGAIN and made user galleries invisible for 3 weeks
-If you have hover offset on, journal descriptions might move down because I haven't tested them
-This is getting hard to update

V1.6
-Quick fix 2 because they changed class names

V1.5
-Quick fix, removed title font option because they removed the font from their website
-Description doesn't move down by default anymore
-Removed 2nd favorite star (top right) in user galleries
-Merged theme with old DA show titles, now you don't need 2 themes
-Brought the design closer to the old DA show titles theme

V1.4
-Fix for DeviantArt update
-Fix again for comments/favorites spacing from bottom

V1.3
-Fix for journal hover offset in search

V1.2
-Faster transition speed and less animation on by default
-Simpler customization (some of you might hate this)
-Outline around description doesn't show when offset is off
-Bug fixes: Hover offset now doesn't apply to journals, scrolling arrows on home page put back above art
-July 8: Font option was missing somehow so that's fixed now

V1.1
-Removed hover width increase for optimization
-Replaced hover offset from bottom -> translateY(), now positive values move it downwards
REDOWNLOAD
-Added title font option
-Added smoother animation (will-change)

V1.0
-Kinda hacked together and ported from the old one.
-Usernames have to get cut (leave 100%-90px of room for them)
BUG: you can't click usernames on journals with hover offset enabled (fixed in 1.2)
