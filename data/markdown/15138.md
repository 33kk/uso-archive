### Description
This is a fork of my earlier style 10335. It is to be used in concert with style 15215; this style primarily changes layout, that style is a colour-inverter. Turn that style on before you turn this one on. This style looks utterly horrendous without style 15215, so don't use it without the other.

The same redesign pattern as in style 10335 holds. 

I'll check comments when I can, and fix any problems I come across. If it's of interest, I plan on using a combination of this and style 15215, so those will be the ones I focus on keeping updated. Well, when my computer's not in for repairs. It has now (April 28) been updated. A picture has also been added that shows how Facebook looks when style 15215 and this are both applied. 

There are a few bugs between the two styles which I haven't worked out. I'd prefer to be able to mark everything in this style another degree of importance, but I don't think that's possible. Also, there seems to be a bug in Firefox with the implementation of background-colors on submit buttons, which means if I set that property, the button becomes a Windows default style button, rather than whatever the CSS had defined. I've been using single-pixel black background-images to get around that, but there are still some kinks.

Image accurate only a long time ago.

@user 18450: see style 19268 for smaller font sizes.
