### Description
Forces all links, images, forms and anything that you input text to submit in (except textareas) to be centered.  Use this anywhere except for a bunch of damned button forms are put in a list and you want the buttons to line up.  I suggest installing as a script so you can arbitrate where it applies more flexibly.
