### Description
<b>UPD</b>: The userstyle is now supported by «<b>Darklingo++</b>» Theme by Justin Rowe!

Meet Duolingo Difficulty Improver — a must-have for those who strive to get the most from their studying process! <b>It hides the sentence in your target language so that you would concentrate on your auditory comprehension of the language. You can also hover the sentence, and it will become revealed so that you could both read it out loud and study visually. Thus, both verbal, visual and audial ways of studying languages are put to use.</b> Great, right?

Around 60% of all Duolingo exercises are aimed at translation from your target language to your native language. The task is quite plain and works little on one's language comprehension skills. The idea of combining translation and listening comprehension was what inspired this magic userstyle, which makes it possible to work more on developing your listening abilities at ease.

### Update notes
<b>Additionally, there are three options that define the behaviour of the style:</b>
1. «<b>Use in Test Out mode</b>» defines whether to hide the sentences in target language in Test Out mode. <b><i>Default option is «Yes».</i></b>
2. «<b>Separate words in Training mode</b>» defines whether the hidden words will be separated or not. Being able to see the amount of words and their length helps sometimes, which is why «No» option is recommended for advanced learners. <b><i>Default option is «Yes», though.</i></b>
3. «<b>Add 'Hover to reveal' area</b>» defines whether the special area will be added. Adding such an are would give a possibility to reveal the sentence without telling Duolingo that you missed some part of a sentence and thus avoid weakening the missed words in the system. <b><i>Default option is «Yes».</i></b>

You can change the settings even after installing the style :)
To do that...:
1. If you see the button «Style Installed» under the screenshot, refresh the page;
2. If «Update Style» button appears, proceed. If not, refresh once again;
3. Press «Customize Settings» button;
4. Set the desired options;
5. Press «Update Style» button.
Voila! The userstyle is now supposed to update its settings.

The userstyle is completely ready for the recent design update :)
