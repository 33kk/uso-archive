### Description
This style reduces the width of the Firefox button to gain visible space. You can also display Firefox button as a tab in maximized windows (affects Windows Aero only).

RESTORE AND MAXIMIZE YOUR WINDOW TO LOAD IT PROPERLY

This is now a part of my addon <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noverflow/">Prevent Tab Overflow</a>

Unlike other similar styles, this one ensures proper functionality at screen edges.
