### Description
IBM Verse update that makes it look a lot more simple and material. Screen real estate has been maximized. This style is meant to be used widescreen. What that means is that you click the folder icon in the top left and the messages maximize on the right. Most aspects will still work non-widescreen, but I make no guarantees.

IMPORTANT: To select your color, scroll down to 'Advanced Settings' and select your options there.  Once selected, you can go back to the top and install.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to click the folder button on the top left to make this widescreen.
