### Description
A style that aims to make many parts of Google Play (on PC web browsers) a lot wider and thus more befitting for widescreen monitors.

Tested on a 1440px-wide monitor. At the time of writing it mostly broadens the app and book sections; the music section has thus far been too difficult for me to properly extend without causing problems with the app listings.
