### Description
This style change the font (by default it uses the monospace courier) to be used for non-HTML mails and for the composing text area. It is intended for the *new interface* of gmail.
It is based on this style: http://userstyles.org/styles/4035
In fact, at least for me, it does not change the font for the composing text area (it works only for already sent/received mails).

Added maxxyme suggestion -- actually not checked... :)
