### Description
same as my Blue Firefox one, but brighter themed :) (firefox logo itself a little different...)
Hope you all Enjoy, Pls Comment ^^

and to the guy who commented below, there is no way to fix that yahoo bug.
because the background of the yahoo!'s input box also uses the about:blank page to put it simply..
try the yahoo beta mail.. it will fix this issue
