### Description
This is a supplement to "Black background, light text : Pitch Dark companion - I" ( http://userstyles.org/styles/13864 ). It makes the menus more visible against the dark background by making them 3D. However if you have not installed PitchDark theme, you may not see any changes. Having the theme is essential for this companion, as opposed to companion-I that is why I have separated these things into two companions. This style is derived from  style 5286

For best results use this in conjunction with  style 13864  and with PitchDark theme ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=pitchdark&cat=all )

Will keep updated with improvements. Please write to me at np1 AT nirajp.8k.com if you spot any inconsistency.
