### Description
Do those fancy-new "hover over this sentence" posts have you religiously hovering over every post on your dash on the off-chance that it might contain some sort of hidden message? Well now all of these will be highlighted for you so you wont have to look quite as hard.

This will work with whatever tag the title attribute is added to, as long as it's in the post itself.
