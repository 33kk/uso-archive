### Description
Also works with gist.github.com, lighthouseapp.com and userstyles.org!

Sorry, but default code fonts that GitHub uses, 'Courier' and 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono' (gist), just don't do it for me. In Windows the default font for gist even shows up without antialiasing (smoothing)! 'Consolas' is a far nicer font and supports antialiasing in Windows, so it's default now :)

Check out the before and after screenshots - it's subtle, but for extended reading it's miles better.

Make sure you have http://userstyles.org/styles/12373 installed to properly see the differences in the screenshots below!
