### Description
Note this approach is no longer supported by FF 3.5+. See http://forum.userstyles.org/comments.php?DiscussionID=3082&page=1#Item_4 for explanation and links to the bug in FF that discusses the changed behavior. 


~~~~~

I like the way Safari highlights text  when using "Find in this page". Works on any page on any site.

If you find that the script is not working, please leave as detailed explanation as possible so that I can fix the problem.

If you like this script check out http://userstyles.org/styles/10652 also which adds Safari like highlight on text boxes.
