### Description
Change the background color to a solid dark color on about:newtab and about:blank pages.

### Update notes
The about:blank background-color is used in different parts of the Firefox UI like when loading the sidebar and is used as a place holder while loading web pages. This will heavily reduce white flashes when loading some webpages. It should not result in dark backgrounds being visible when sites are fully loaded.

The color of the background is the same color as used in the Firefox developer tools.
