### Description
This is for the new compact theme that comes with Firefox. So before you install this, go to about:addons (preferences/options) --> appearance --> compact dark. If you're on Nightly 57, you might also like my userChrome.css which is a dark and minimal theme a bit different than this one: https://pastebin.com/AUSzqWXB
