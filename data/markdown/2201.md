### Description
Awesome feature of the gmarks extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2888 is that when you press home+home, an ajaxy-search interface of the google bookmarks pops up.  Unfortunately it was a little plain.  Hence this style.

Changing #1e3d90 in the style below will change the background color from blue to your choice...
