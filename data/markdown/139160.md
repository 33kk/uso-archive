### Description
This style reorganizes the Outlook Web App for Exchange 2010 interface into a mobile friendly page. In addition, the styling is updated to look more like a modern application.

This style should work on pages with a <i>messenger.example.com</i> or <i>outlook.example.com</i> URL. If this doesn't meet your organizations URL, please let me know.

<strong>This style is still under development, please read the additional info before installing.</strong>
