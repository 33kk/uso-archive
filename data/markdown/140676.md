### Description
Makes the ROBLOX site white and simplifies certain parts of it. Contains animations. Currently only tested on Google Chrome. Use in other browsers at own risk. Keep in mind that this is not even close to finished, and is likely to contain ugly inconveniences.

### Update notes
A MORE IMPORTANT NOTE THAN THE ONE BELOW: This theme is inactive. I am very unlikely to add or edit it anymore due to a lack of motivation when it comes to programming. Even if I were to get back into doing CSS, I am more likely to update Roblox Animated instead.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I will continue updating this theme again. ROBLOX reverted their catalog, but due to the way the CSS is put up in the avatar editor, I will not be able to add icons there.

You are by no means allowed to publish a remixed, edited or entirely copied version of this theme, nor are you allowed to take snippets of this theme and put it into your own work.

CHANGELOG:
1.0.5
+ New background for the ROBLOX avatar editor. At least I managed to put SOME change in there.
* Fixed voting buttons being weirdly positioned
* Made your robux more visible than it was before. Now you don't have to scroll all the way up to see it properly.
- Removed John Doe

1.0.4
+ Released an experimental dark mode (Not recommended to use). NOTE: This feature is put on hold while Stylish fixes their Style Settings.
* Fixed some minor issues.
- Removed John Doe

1.0.3
+ Added catalog icons for the category selector. These icons (with the exception of the gear icons) were made by ROBLOX for their mobile avatar editor, so full credits to them for those icons.
+ "Slight" addition to the avatar editor. --Note that this update doesn't have effect anymore due to the new ROBLOX avatar editor
- Removed John Doe

1.0.2:
* Minor visual changes.
- Removed John Doe

1.0.1:
+ Added a changelog in this description!
+ Made the gamepage more compact and smooth. NOTE: For extra game information hover your mouse over the game for a while.
- Removed that annoying loading circle (it blocked interactions and was shown too frequently).
- Removed John Doe
