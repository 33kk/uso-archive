### Description
The colors of this theme have been designed to relieve your eyes of harmful blue rays for your eyesight, especially at the end of the day. Indispensable if you spend a lot of time on Facebook. Ideal for community managers.

The challenge of this theme is not necessarily to make a theme completely switched to gray, but to relieve especially the eyes faced with large areas of display.
