https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/374789-fullscreen-google-keep
This implement some other features with js.

Features:
+ Take notes in full screen
+ Bigger font size, line height and page padding
+ Fix double scrollbar problem
+ Optional: Limit the font size of notes shown in dashboard (so that shorter notes won't be BIGGER)

Motivation:
I usually note down my personal thoughts on google keep. I found it a little embarrassing to open it in public because the dashboard is always visibleðŸ˜…...This is the main reason I wrote this. A full-screen editor also make writing a lot easier. You can use google keep like a notepad now!
