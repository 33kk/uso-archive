### Description
Removes all useless clutter at theync.com

Preview shows media page.
This style affects media list page, too.


UPDATES:

* 2010-06-02 → Now the header got removed to for saving screen space, because we already kno on what site we are, don’t we? Thanks to userstyles.org user eLvuduNegro for this little suggestion! For whatever reason the updated sstyle does not contain the neccessary changes for hiding the header (the edit page shows it, but on the actual style page there is the old version). Maybe this is a caching issue. Simple try in a few hours or so.
