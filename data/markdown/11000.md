### Description
Update: I put v1 back because v2 had errors. I thought it would work on all firefox themes but turns out only mine. I will try to fix it in version 3

Ok, this is an update from my two-day old styles; http://userstyles.org/styles/10986
The problem with that style was it showed the tab area even when you don't have tabs. Its fixed now.
