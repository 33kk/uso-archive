### Description
Variation of style 5189 by user 1203
Which is a variation of style 5060 by user 1203

This theme changes the blue gradient tab bar (to straight black) which doesn't work well with multi-rows in Tab Mix Plus (plus it just doesn't fit the "All Black" title of the previous theme).
To make up for the lack of difference in the tabs which aren't selected and the selected tab, the unselected tabs have a slightly darker text color.

Also removed the slight opacity change to the AwesomeBar and the SearchBar when they are not in focus. That's just my personal preference.

Note: Base theme used in the screenshot is "XP on Vista" (available at addons.mozilla.org). It also uses Tax Mix Plus, which is why there is a couple extra buttons.

Update 6-28-08:
-Made the Find Bar match the theme
