### Description
Makes the Todoist website wider (less horizontal white space) & task/project lines narrower (less vertical white space).

There's a <b>bookmarklet</b> code added at the top of the code if you want to use this style only occassionally (for example for printing).

<b>If you're using the DARK THEME, please choose it under the settings!</b>

### Update notes
I'm not a coder (complete amateur) and this is my first time posting anything code-related. If you find bugs, feel free to let me know, but I can't promise I'll be able to fix them on my own.

Credit for the beginning of the code (wider content and wider left menu) goes to <a href=https://userstyles.org/users/822504>coder-in-me</a> (for his style <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/172285/wider-todoist>Wider Todoist</a>). I fixed the jumps in his code between the Today/Inbox and Next 7 Days views (it was the hovering scrollbar that was causing the problem).

Update 1.0 (10 March 2020):
The 9th March Todoist update changed something in regards to the vertical narrow space, which caused it to be wide again. I hope I fixed it.
