### Description
A Dark Theme for Vid.Me.

Really not much else to say, other than the coding of the style itself is very poor and in need of a massive rewrite because I kind of just pumped it out. 

So far, everything in the site has been styled, although I might have missed something here and there. I wrote the style while not having an account, and while having an account, so I could get both the signed out and signed in parts.

From a cursory glance, everything is pretty much done and there. I think a few pieces of text here and there are a bit dark, and I couldn't figure out how to make the hamburger span in the navbar a different color.

I'll definitely be  re-writing this theme later, but right now it works fine.
