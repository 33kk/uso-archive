### Description
MPGH Forum on default has a complete white color scheme which can be hard on your eyes at night. 
<br />
I decided to attempt a dark theme to fix that! :)

NOTE: I am a beginner in creating styles and css experience in general. This is actually my first style, please feel free to let me know anything I might have missed or any other suggestions.
