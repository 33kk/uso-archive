### Description
install this style ONLY if you're a REAL Ziomek


notes:
I used the original code by gnfoster: http://userstyles.org/styles/4579


PS. 
this is just FYI - when I hit the button "Load into Stylish", the Stylish popup appears but the code does not get pasted in the window for some reason.. 
but if I hit "Show Code" first, and then load the style, it works... not sure what's the case, might be my FirefoxPortable..
