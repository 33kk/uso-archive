### Description
UPDATE:
SEPT. 5 2010 - Pandora must have updated their stylesheet and it has broken this userstyle. Here is a quick fix to clean up the Pandora player a bit. The player isn't centered right now, but it will be once I put out another update. Stay tuned.

Please send any bugs or missing styled parts to jdorenbush@gmail.com and I'll try and update soon.

FEATURES:
- Removes ads that AdBlock fails to block.
- Removes the background image and uses a solid color.
- Removes footer.
- Uses a solid 1 pixel border
- Shrinks the height of the player to save screen space.

COMING SOON
- Center player
- Add style changes across all Pandora pages
