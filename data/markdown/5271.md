### Description
* Very roughly re-centers Casual Collective. Mostly 'cause I don't want to muck around with making center proper work. Will use 50% down to the 935px minimum width.
* Moves profile controls to the right. Just 'cause.

If you know of a way to select the tabs and icon with css (as there are no identifying marks on those elements,) please let me know so I can move those as well.

Center job is very rough. Casual Collective's page structure is _not_conducive to user styling.

Note: Requires browser support of the '>' (child) selector. (CSS3)
