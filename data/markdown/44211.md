### Description
For Firefox 3.6+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

I occasionally run into posts or quotes with too-large CODE-tags Boxes or overly large Images, Pics, or Screenshots at http://forums.mozillazine.org which blow the margin out, giving that the horizontal scroll bar makes reading posts on the page way more of a hassle. This style prevents CODE-Tag Boxes and overly large Images, Pics, or Screenshots from breaking the forum by resizing them to a "max-width"(adjust to your own preference).

To view an Image Original Size, mouse left "Click and Hold" over Image or left click mouse over an "Linked Image with blue border". This style can be easily modified for other forums.

Tested on Firefox 3.6+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.
