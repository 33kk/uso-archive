### Description
The webpage to view all the icons in the Streamline icons library has an annoying header that cannot be "closed" or "hidden" in any way like these "notification bars" usually can with a button, usually in the top right corner.

It says: "ðŸ˜Ž Streamline is the worldâ€™s biggest icon library â€“ Learn more"

And takes up 40px in height.
