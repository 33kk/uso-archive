### Description
Better alternative to c0lin's greasemonkey script at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/42670. Since this is a css style it requires the add-on stylish to be installed before installing this. Also, this runs immediately even before the pages load unlike c0lin's script.  Sorry for crappy screen shots, userstyles only allows me for 75kb images and below. Removes most advertisements on the page and in the vista 1337 theme it gets rid the annoying vista software advertisement.
