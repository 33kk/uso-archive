### Description
If you are not familiar with readability you will need to install the bookmarklet (should work in all browsers) from readability.com/bookmarklets/ The site has a video that explains how it works.

This style makes things a little more readable.  Don't install the style until you have installed the bookmarklet and adjusted its settings to your liking.  The bookmarklet is harmless.

I put this together in about 5 minutes so it may need some tweaking.
