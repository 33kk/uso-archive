### Description
Hide some of the topbar and reorganize the search box.

 Gmail Calendar Documents Web Reader more â–¼                     *******@gmail.com |  |  | Settings | Help | Sign out


Also hides two links named "Refresh", Invite-box, and in the footer: quota, terms&agreements-link collection, and the worst disturbance -- the tip-of-the-day that keeps disturbing by changing its text all the time.
