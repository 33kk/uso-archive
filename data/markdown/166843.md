### Description
This is a simple dark theme, which removes some clutter and makes it easier on the eyes.
It also "centers" the content.

Tested on the SYNTHDIY pages, should work ok with the rest of the pages too.

I tried preserving the original style as much as I could

### Update notes
v 1.0 - Release
