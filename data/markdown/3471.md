### Description
This is a custom about:blank screen featuring the Firefox logo - inspired by Dark Firefox, which I really like. This variation makes it easier to type in wysiwyg text editors encountered on many webmail, forum, and blog sites that load the about:blank page as a background. This is a revised color palette from the original Firefox logo, not a faded image.

The background is an embedded base-64 image, not linked. I used the generator here to convert my image:
