### Description
Just a week ago, Wikipedia changed its fonts. The new ones are hard to read on my screen (font size too large). They are also ugly, mixing sans with serif fonts.

This stylesheet reverts everything back to sans and makes the fonts a bit smaller. It is not identical to the old stylesheet, but it is close.
