### Description
BIG fonts. It works with the NEW NEW FORUMS. I also changed the forum selection, search, favorites.... Bold text is bolder, even and odd posts use different colours, popup is moved (ccp will probably fix that), and many tweaks everywhere I can't even remember.

It seems it also works with the style "Eve Online Classic Forums Style" (kind of, maybe a couple of bugs)
