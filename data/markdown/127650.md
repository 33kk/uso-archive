### Description
Back in 2013, Gary (https://tinyurl.com/zj6mqjf) completely turned what used to be a site focused on users and a community to an inflated, money cow, greedy site. Gary has gotten negative feedback from users, but like all greedy people, doesn't care about the users who brought the site revenue and popularity. This style aims to Degary Gaia. All Gaia Cash or IRL Money References on the Site are removed. This style will be updated every time I find something.
