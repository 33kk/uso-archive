### Description
This Style hides the Reddit Sidebar by default.
The Sidebar can be brought up again by hovering over a small banner at the top right.
This way, a lot of horizontal space is free for comments/content, especially on 4:3 monitors.

As always with reddit styles, it is helpful to uncheck the option "<a href="http://cdn.userstyles.org/style_screenshots/83412_additional_6553.png?r=1361451020">Allow reddits to show me custom styles"</a>" in the preferences (screenshot). But it should work fine with most custom reddit styles as well as userstles.
