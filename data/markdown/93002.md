### Description
This is my take on The Guardian as if it had a darker themed layout. So far it's a very BETA release and it needs a lot of work and tightening to make the theme solid, so expect some hiccups in the style sheet sometimes. 

In the coming weeks there will be an alternative theme that isn't more tuned towards my personal taste and it'll have all the social media buttons and functionality as the original for the people that interact and comment and share articles. Enjoy...
