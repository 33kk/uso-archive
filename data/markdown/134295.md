### Description
fixes the clan nav bar so there are no gaps at all in the clan navbar DOES NOT affect guilds at all and does not affect any other part of the site, great for giving clans a much needed fix. will also fix the very fist version of the guilds page if you can still get to it. not that hard but gaia no longer provides a link to it. i wont either but its very easy to find if you know how to do it also thanks to a friend on gaia who helped with this ( Carlos )
