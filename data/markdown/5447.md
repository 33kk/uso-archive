### Description
This stylesheet replaces the background of blank tabs and windows with a repeating animated GIF of a glittering, starry sky, in the antiquated style of an amateur homepage from 1997. The image is stored inline as a data URI, so it doesn't rely on a server.

The image is shamelessly pilfered from Olia Lialina's exceptional 'Vernacular Web 2' article: <http://www.contemporary-home-computing.org/vernacular-web-2/>

As you can see, the image below isn't really a screenshot; it's just the animated GIF itself. If you need help imagining the effect before downloading this style, just picture it with a status bar underneath, a tab bar above, and a scrollbar to the right.

I hope you do not find the stars too big or the glittering too fast!
