### Description
Doesn't work with Firefox 2. Works with Firefox 3.

Features:
- transparency
- changable background
- golden skill colors
- running much leaner than the previous version; only 1 image file is used
- solved minor problems
- rounded background
- match report stadium picture
- v2.3 - tactics picture
- v2.4 - updated CSS navigation menu

To change the background, use one of the following files:
Sea 	http://i34.tinypic.com/t0p7qq.jpg
Grass	http://i35.tinypic.com/66yj5c.jpg
Rustic	http://i36.tinypic.com/2qdv5gy.jpg
Ice		http://i38.tinypic.com/rlicyw.jpg
Blue ice	http://i38.tinypic.com/1zcdco.jpg
...and put them on the only place in the code where image files exist.

To create your own background, select a part of some picture around 300x300 pixels large. Then, use GIMP (a free and a better alternative to Photoshop), open your new picture, and go to: Filters / Map / Make Seamless. Save the file, upload it to TinyPic.com, and replace the image files in the code of this style.

The golden skills are there for a reason. You can see right away which skills are sup, bri and awe. If you can't see a skill because it's too dark (poor, awf), it means it's not relevant for you to see. I have set this up for my own convenience, because skills under sup don't matter to me, you can change it for yourself if you wish. It's very easy to see your opponent's strong points with this coloring.

The previous version is obsolete so I've replaced the entry in Userstyles.org with this one.

Enjoy it!
