### Description
This is an extension to Bou's extension to Jim's "Fix Slashdot fonts" style. :)

It puts the comment scores right beside the title, rather than underneath it (isn't that where it used to be?) - I think it's a better use of space.

Also, I added !important to the body{} styles so that they take effect.

Update 2006-06-09: Minor tweaks to div.title to reflect changes to /.'s CSS.
