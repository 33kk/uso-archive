### Description
On May 12, 2016, Ars Technica released a new design for their website, which for the moment has gotten rid of the dark mode that so many people love. Since I don't feel like waiting for them to release a dark mode, I made my own style override to do it for myself. I hope you enjoy!

(NOTE: Ars has temporarily reverted to their old design, so this stylesheet is relatively useless at the moment.)
