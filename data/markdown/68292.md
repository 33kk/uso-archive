### Description
What it does:  Makes websites grayscale, then inverts it.

<b>This affects <u>everything</u> (except video and probably any embed objects).  Affects images as well.</b>

Page scrolling speed is slowed when this style is active.

How to use:  When you come across a website that is too dark/light, you add the website to the list of affected sites to make it opposite of what it currently is - dark becomes light, light becomes dark.

Play with the values to whatever you prefer.  You can delete <i><u>brightness</u></i> and <i><u>contrast</u></i> properties in code to slightly increase scrolling performance.

Use it on sites that mainly have text content.
