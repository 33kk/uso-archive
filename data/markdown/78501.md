### Description
It is ideal to use this theme if you have a larger desktop screen - it looks better. Hopefully the background image would fit all screens. If not, feel free to message me on Tumblr and I'll resize it for you. Background Image credit goes to <a href="http://www.deskcar.com/html/6657/7.shtml">deskcar.com</a>. Please make sure you see how the dashboard is going to look like <a href="http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/2753/cimv.png">(click here)</a> before installing!

Note: One Piece logo, new post window, notification window, and buttons do not come with theme.
