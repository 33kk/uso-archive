### Description
An update to 2018's New Gmail that creates a more uniform, modern look without text all running into each other. Actions are all aligned, tabs are more well-defined, and colors are consistent.

Note that you <i>must</i> be using the new <b>2018 version of Gmail</b> (currently beta as of this writing) for this to work. If the style seems to break Gmail, you're likely not running the new version.

You should also  select the <b>Light theme</b> (usually the default) from Gmail's theme selector to ensure some standard base styles.

Full source code, build infrastructure, and theme for Kiwi for Gmail is <a href="https://github.com/chipx86/nicer-new-gmail/">available on GitHub</a>.
