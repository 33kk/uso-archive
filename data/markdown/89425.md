### Description
On all websites, change the width of tab characters in code from the default 8 spaces wide to 4 spaces wide, or whatever other size you choose in the selector below. The setting affects all HTML <tt><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></tt> elements.

This is like my other style <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/70979/github-better-sized-tabs-in-code">GitHub: better-sized tabs in code</a>, but it applies to all websites. However, it only works on properly marked-up code.

This style may not work on some sites that present their code in an unusual way, such as within <code>pre</code> blocks that are not marked as <code>code</code>. If you want to force <code>pre</code> elements to use this tab size even if they are not code, add “<code>pre,</code>” before “<code>code {</code>” in the CSS.

### Update notes
Here is the text in the screenshot. After installing this style, you can paste this text into the left box on <a href="http://markdownr.com/">Markdownr.com</a> to see the style in action:
<pre><code>(This is a site where you can write text and code on the left and see it rendered on the right.)

    1234
    	Tab-indented text in a code block

See – in the rendered HTML, the tab is four spaces wide, instead of the default eight. That text has a tab character before it, not four spaces.</code></pre>
