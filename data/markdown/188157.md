### Description
Zerohedge is one of my favorite news sites as it contrasts the mainstream media. It has the usual style of a news website and is convenient to read. However, it does not print well. This style sheet only styles printing of the site so the web appearance remains untouched. Printing of the website is improved by the style sheet, but still far from good.
