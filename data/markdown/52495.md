### Description
TESTED IN CHROME ON MAC: Still need to work on Firefox.

I love iFanboy, but the site has always been difficult to read. On August 15th, 2011, they launched a new site design that added a bunch of back in features, but left some of my major pain points intact.

Unfortunately, the site seemed harder to read. So I built my first userstyle to clean up the site and make it readable.
