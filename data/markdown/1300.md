### Description
Updated 6/07/2012: Fixed the white-ness of #content_wrapper.

Updated 6/06/2012: Been a while, hasn't it? Updated the stupid page width, header, and removed images from listings.

Updated 3/31/2010: Just a small update. Noticed a few ads slipping thru when, for some reason, I had AdBlock Plus turned off, so I updated it to hide those. Also fixed quote blocks and highlighted text on the icky site forums.

Updated 9/28/2009: What is it with FF.Net and changing CSS class names? Fixed their latest crap.
