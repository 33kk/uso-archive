### Description
Resizes images that are too large on Clutchfans BBS. You know, for that one jackass who refuses to spoiler his 4,000,000 x 12,000,000,000 picture of Luis Scola saying "He look OK" - now it won't stretch your screen anymore!

Edit the pixel width to customize this for your display settings. I'd recommend going about 250-300px less than your display's width to make room for the usernames on the left and the page borders.

Also take into account that sometimes jackasses quote the giant picture, and that box-within-a-box aspect uses a few pixels too.


Based on style 2122
