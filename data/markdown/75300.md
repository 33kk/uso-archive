### Description
Allows use of custom cardbacks for moe fun.

Yeah, to use your OWN card images, take a peek at the options below.

Click "Provide my own" and link to your own image (just upload something to imgur or whatever).
This will generate a style using your images instead of mine. 


Protip: Though if you are using the default font, the card dimensions will be 144 × 186.
Otherwise, if you are using your own font and conversely, font size (either through your browser or something else), you'll have to figure out the dimensions yourself. The image will start in the top left no matter what, so if you use a bigger image than the card size on your window, it'll harmlessly go off the right and bottom edge of the card.

Godspeed, /a/non.
