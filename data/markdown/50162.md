### Description
Basically restores Google search results page to the state before 2011-06-28. Not only makes the top bar light again but also reverts the Ubuntu-EMO-styled left sidebar (If you don't understand why Ubuntu-EMO, look at the Ubuntu homepage, especially the bottom part, and the screenshots from at least last two years' versions --- bleak, gloomy, parched colours --- dark red, orange, purple, gray. What Google did is quite a mirror of this.) I understand it reflects the mood of the empty and depressive society but for people with a full and balanced life it's not only distracting but also unnerving. I also got rid of the iPhone-styled search box --- another stupid fashion.
