### Description
I got tired of the other one not being updated with the big blue bar at the top. I used his code as a base, and expanded upon it. I hope he found a date and stopped using the site!

I'm a freelance graphic and web designer, currently single, and so I'd rather visit OKC at a coffee shop without all the bright colors advertising "I AM SINGLE AND LOOKING". lol
