### Description
A quick alteration to the FJ theme for personal views

### Update notes
New Feature: Total Anonymous. If you wish to not know who post anything anymore than this is for you. You no longer have to see who is posting it.* This will hide Avatars and Usernames from being displayed on your browser.*
Alpha Update 2.0
Great help from Fimii, jofj, leneotroll, and connerence, thanks for everything guys.
A great improvement, I just wanted to get it released. Item hiding is coming soon, I promise.
*Does not hide color text. Don't know how to fix that sorry.
**THIS DOES NOT HIDE YOUR INFORMATION, USING THIS IN AN ATTEMPT TO POST A ANONYMOUS MESSAGE IS POINTLESS AND WILL NOT WORK.

Alpha Update 0.12
~Thank you Fimiii for your help with the thumbs, thank you Theme Group for suggestions~ 
Fixed options menu, added a second color to rolls, Red thumbs are now lavender and thumbs for content.
Alpha Release 0.1
Known bugs: Red thumbs still appear red, some things still show when they shouldn't (Including Avatars)
(Working on items atm.)
Please understand this code is a complete mess and needs to be cleaned up, do not attempt to edit anything.
I also can't vouch for stability in Firefox. Sorry.
