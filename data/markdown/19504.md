### Description
Replaces the plain white background with a nice simple grey background with backdrop shadow, and removes/resizes the light blue bar that spans the entire window width which ruins this style. =)

Credit to user 11162 for the base script style 9188.

#-#-#-Fix - 26/08/2009-#-#-#
Facebook seem to have updated or changed the menu/presence bar (the blue bar at the top of the screen) which makes it the entire width of the browser window.
This fix resolves this problem.
