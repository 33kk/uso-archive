### Description
Pimp.my.Gmail series!
If you prefer a script, check out : http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/75047

First things first, this style is inspired & built upon the http://userstyles.org/styles/19607 style by "user 15925"

This style will Pimp up the Gmail Appbar, which is nothing but the navigation bar which hosts links to other services of Google.
The icons in this style are all 16px. Some are taken from google sites, some from tango icon packages, while the rest are from the style mentioned above.
So credits to the authors of those packages.
