### Description
WHEN I LISTED "AD REMOVAL" IN THE PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION, I WAS CHOOSING MY WORDS FOOLISHLY. WHAT I HAVE DONE IS TWEAKED STEPHEN VAN DYKE'S CODE TO BETTER DISPLAY AN AD-FREE DRUDGE REPORT. YOU MUST USE ADBLOCK PLUS OR SOME MEANS MEANS OF AD BLOCKING TO ACTUALLY NOT GET ADS.

Credit to Stephen VanDyke (Drudge Report Overhaul).
