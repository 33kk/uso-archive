### Description
UPDATED with fixes on October 15th

This will remove the footer, but it will move the 2 useful things from it (your
account activity and account space left) to the top right and out of the way.
If you want to remove one or both of those, just comment them out appropriately.

Just look at the screenshots for a visual explanation.

Made for resolutions wider than 1024, cause gmail always acts funny at 800x600.
