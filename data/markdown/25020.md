### Description
TV Tropes is a great website. This style enables the "fast reading" mode. 

With this new style, text is centered (and justified), and it doesn't exceed a comfortable max width. The header got less colors and less clutter and is also smaller to give more space to text. Headers and links are more prominent. Overall, there are less lines to disctract the eye - less horizontal lines, underlines, borders around boxes.
