***PLEASE READ!!!***
Sorry this is my first dash theme. (So it's not the best.)
For some reason it applies to all sites.  (At least on my laptop)
So to stop that, click the userstyles icon at the top of your screen and click edit on this theme.  Then, where is says Applies to:  Go to the first drop down box and click URL starting with then in the other box next to it type in http://www.tumblr.com/ and then save.

And if your icons are ugly, (like the original text,photo, quote, etc) use this to fix it. ^_^ ::  http://userstyles.org/styles/61962/tumblr-icon-fix?r=1330797607
