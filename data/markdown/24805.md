### Description
Tested on: Firefox 3.5.x (Theme: Vista-aero) / Mac OS X 10.5.8 Intel ( 1280x800 ) & Dell Desktop Windows XP
Reference: style 24725
 Addons installed on Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collection/67683cff-dbd8-0caa-a3bf-b38b3e8a1208
  Too be honest, I have no idea if it affects the layout or not.
  That link above is a collection I created mainly to backup my addons, they probably have nothing to do with the style at all.
  I added it just to be on the safe side…

«Removes»
Ads (includes the blank space left when ads are removed)
Footer
Showcase (does not remove the one on homepage)
Extra padding/ margins
Extra "Search" Label beneath search button

Changes :
December 13
 Fixed: Navigation background not showing
  Was not showing up due to image url changed, should now work as I changed the coding up little on the domains.

February 3
 Added coding to remove extra "Search" label.
 Apparently, the label doesn't show on my mac - with or without the code, but does on my PC.

Known Problems:
Will show a large black space at bottom if page is not long enough - Will work on fixing next, no promises though.

And well... it seems the preview pictures somehow got lost -.-;; I don't know why it got deleted or when it did. Perhaps I'll add new ones, perhaps I won't.
