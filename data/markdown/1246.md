### Description
So, after "modding" two styles, I feel it is time I contribute something of my own to this site, and this is the first of several to come.

As you can see from the screenshots, it's quite an overhaul, and I must say I am VERY happy with the results.

Key Features:
 - No ads, anywhere!
 - A dedicated header for the search area, which is easy on the eyes, and has a nice focus/no-focus effect when you input text.
 - Removed any, and I mean ANY, excess text from the site.
 - Reduced the size of text in the results page.
 - Better spaced the results.
 - Removed the old numbering (1.:, 2.:, etc.), and added a custom counter of my own, with a nice prefix as well.
 - Marked "visited" links as "crossed out", and "disabled" their responsiveness to the mouse. (They are still active and functional, just don't look like it)
 - Moved the "found results" message to the top, and fixed quite alot of its grammer. (As much as the current CSS methods let me anyways)

Any bug reports, comments, or suggestions are highly welcome!

Enjoy.

-------
Update [08.21.07]: Updated to match changes Astalavista.box.sk made to their HTML.
Update [11.01.06]: Due to an issue with the links not showing up for some users, I wrote an alternative method to hide the old numbering.
If you're not seeing the links properly; Open the code, uncomment the code between the "A1" comments and comment out the code between the "A2" comments.
NOTE: This method also hides the "found results" message!

I wish astalavista.box.sk had better structure for their pages so that style could be a much nicer piece of code (and less buggy) than it is now...
