### Description
Thanks Edward Jones for providing me a great basis to improve the style! --> https://userstyles.org/styles/131008/drive-darkmode

The pages I focus heavily on are:
 - Docs homepage and editor view
 - Sheets homepage and editor view
 - the main Google search results page
These pages are kept "almost perfect" when I have time (busy with studies ahah).

By the way, if you wanna get the most of the style, use Firefox ;) I don't update my style for other browsers (lack of time as usual ;) )

For the other pages I don't garantee anything ;) As I said the code basis was written by Edward Jones and I don't have enough time to keep everything up to date. So if you want to add updates to the code, please tell me the changes so I can add your contribution to the mode ;) Thanks!
