### Description
On large screens I don't like that Google search results are too much to the left. 
So I wrote this simple theme that moves the results 600px to the right and also makes the results summary much wider.
Cards appear on the left on the newly freed up space.
Feel free to adapt it to your needs, it is a very simple CSS.
