### Description
This skin will hide your own posts on your dashboard, and your reblogs on your blog tab.

Why? So you can get to the good stuff! When I'm looking at my dashboard, I don't care that I posted, I care that I got a reblog and like!
Want to see all your notes? Just go to your blog tab. you'll see only your posts and notes, not someone else's.
