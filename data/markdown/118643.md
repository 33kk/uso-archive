### Description
<b>Before you can install this style, you have to get the add-on "Stylus" or a similar userstyle manager:<br><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">Chrome</a></b>
<b><a href="http://hgtools.neocities.org/">Click here</a> to download Autocropper or Hosthelper.</b>
<b>New: <a href="https://hgtools.neocities.org/static/BackgroundTemplate.xcf">Click here</a> for a masked GIMP template to create smooth blending backgrounds. <a href="http://y.zxq.co/qxvwuz.webm">Simply select each layer</a> and copypaste your image in it. Blending and resolution are done automatically.
<b>Uploading your own images takes extremely long, so it is recommended to put the link to an URL instead!</b>

### Update notes
<b>FAQ</b>
<cite>What format should the background have?</cite>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/yBebRDi.png">Click here for a visual explanation.</a>
The backgrounds are aligned in such a way that the top left corner is at the spot where the autocropper starts cropping. The image then repeats in all directions. Normal backgrounds should have a width of <b>679 or larger</b>, Fallen Tributes 367 or larger.
<cite>My background is not properly aligned</cite>
If the background is off by a few pixels, use the Background X/Y Offset setting to adjust the position of the background.

<b>And here's a guide on how to save and switch between multiple userstyles:</b>
>Go to addons (Ctrl+Shift+A) and User Styles.
>Press Edit on the style you want to save.
>Copy everything.
>Close it, go to "Write new style" and paste.
>Select a new name and save.
You can then switch between the saved style, the hg customizer and other saved styles by enabling and disabling them. Do not enable more than one style at a time!

<small>The userstyle is a cooperation project between Rin and Aikawa, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.</small>
