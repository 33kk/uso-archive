### Description
Removes pretty much everything that isn't a part of the article from The Verge. Best used with a script blocker. Script blocker will prevent the page from moving up/down on medium-large sized articles, and reduce any overhead on data by preventing the removed image from ever showing up anyway.

Removes: Sidebar, tags, story image, header (entirely), social media buttons, ads etc.

Fixes: Width of article, bottom border (now all borders are closed),
