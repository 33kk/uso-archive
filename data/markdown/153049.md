### Description
<p>This is an entirely custom, fully-featured dark theme for Reddit. It changes the layout, colors, and more. It does work with the RES extension, though your personal settings might need to be tweaked.</p>

<p>Make sure you choose the color theme you want: Cyan, Lime, Green, Red, Purple, Pink, or Yellow! There's three options you have to select, and it's best to select the same color for all three options.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I designed this for a 1920 x 1080 resolution, and a lot of the elements have "position: absolute" set. I did NOT set this up to be responsive or mobile-friendly. If you have issues with smaller resolutions or smaller window sizes, I'm sorry.</p>

### Update notes
<strong>UPDATES</strong>
<strong>1/10/18 --</strong> Fixed the "Active RES" element.
<strong>12/21/17 --</strong> Styled the Comment Thread, Profile, and Messages sections.
