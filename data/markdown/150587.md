### Description
Hover mouse over the bottom of a video to see video controls (view in full screen, mute etc.).
Known issue: Full Screen button may stop working in the feed until you refresh the page (of course, opening videos in a new tab also helps in this case).
Only works on Chrome, Safari, Opera and other Webkit-based browsers. FireFox doesn't create video controls unless they are requested, so css is not enough to show controls.
