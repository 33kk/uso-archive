### Description
Simple black text style. Buzzchurch's current CSS is unbearable and almost impossible to read - virtually no contrast between the font colour and the background colour - this simple style fixes that. At last I can read the forums again!

(Polite request to website developers: PLEASE stop using low contrast styles - they don't look good, and put people off reading your sites.)
