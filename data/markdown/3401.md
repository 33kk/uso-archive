### Description
Originally based on a theme I pulled from here, though I can't seem to find it now. The original theme just reskinned the Home control panel. I've expanded it now to cover the photos, mail system, browse users, and the myspace.com main page, to avoid looking at the random crap that piles up there. There are some pages (such as the Edit Profile and Account Settings pages) that cannot be edited to match simply because of the slipshod coding for the site. Some pages barely look at the CSS, and instead have everything hard coded in. And there are some that I didn't bother with (such as the videos and blog pages), simply because I have my own website for that reason alone. Either way, check it out, enjoy, and send any questions my way.

-Edit 10/13/07-
Updated code to repair damage from MySpace layout changes
Fixed site declaration for the myspace.com homepage to just affect the home page, not myspace.com/username pages.
