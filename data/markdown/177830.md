### Description
This affects the Art Library, the Journal Tab and the Compendium. I primarily wrote it for the Journal tab to make filing easier, but I'm finding I like it on the other views too. This basically makes the thumbnail images smaller and removes excess padding from the above mentioned lists. It makes it a lot easier to drag an item up or down a long list, and to see more entries at once. It's not as desirable on the art library tab, but if you want to restore the function there, you can always toggle the style.
