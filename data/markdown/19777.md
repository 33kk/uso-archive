### Description
Old facebook header with drop shadow, drop shadows on profile pics, removes ads, removes news feed filter (you can comment out this part out to change what filter you like to use -- I will be working on a userscript at some point to allow quick access to the filter without it taking up the space it normally does), stretches some content that felt alone with no more ads, removes suggestions on home page (you can comment out the code to get them back).

Please email stylishfb@gmail.com with any bugs.
I'm also planning on getting a FB page and Twitter profile set up to allow some more interaction between me and my style users. Others things with Stylish Facebook are also in development to give more customization options, but that will be still be a while :).  Thanks for all the installs and support!
