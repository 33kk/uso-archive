### Description
Plex behaves annoyingly if you shrink the window to a width under 1000px. This small css tries to fix that by moving stuff around when the window shrinks a bit. It's pretty hacky but it should work.
Note: This was only tested on plex music, because i just don't have movies on my plex. It may completely break the site for movies.
