### Description
This script is for everyone who thinks artists deserve a fair chance in the strange growing world of art.
Remove that popular button and never look back.
Because you shouldn't let others define what you think makes good art.

Art is the result of anything that contains effort and heart!


To promote the fight against the Popular tab use the unofficial dA Stamp!
