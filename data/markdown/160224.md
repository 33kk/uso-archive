### Description
A style that aims to make most of Pixiv considerably wider and more befitting of widescreen monitors.

The style has been mostly designed with a 1440px-wide monitor in mind (and for browsing instead of uploading), but should also result in a visible-enough effect on 1600px- and 1920px-wide monitors.
