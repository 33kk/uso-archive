### Description
Darkens everything on a page by using a few image filter tricks.

Colours vaguely match what the page design had. This is especially useful for pages with syntax highlighting. 

Warning: some plugins, images, etc, might look weird or depressing.

Sites like stackoverflow, github, wikipedia all look nice and comfy.
