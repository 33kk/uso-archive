### Description
For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This style provides more space for the Old Status Bar Icons and Toolbar Buttons Icons on the Add-on Bar by decreasing their icon spacing and by hiding useless toolbar button drop-markers and the hover background effects of toolbar buttons and the Add-on Bar Close Button.

Works well with Userstyles:

style 37319

style 43235

Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

Modified code from Userstyles:

style 37460

style 40960

style 60116

style 60114

style 53823
