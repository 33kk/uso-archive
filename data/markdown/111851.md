### Description
This userstyle is designed to provide users with a highly customizable, widely compatible way to detect and reformat text with a color value set to "transparent" (aka <dfn>invisitext</dfn>) on XenForo forums.

The default settings add indicators to show that invisitext is present, but keeps it hidden until you mouse-over or touch it.  This helps maintain the effect intended by the author (hidden text) while ensuring that you are aware of its presence and can easily view it.

<b>Currently Works On:</b> SpaceBattles, SufficientVelocity, QuestionableQuesting, & XenForo.

See Notes for additional details.

<small>Loosely based on user 251024's <cite>style 107225</cite>, which was distributed under a CC-BY 4.0 license at the time.</small>

──────────────────────────<dl><strong><em>Known Issues</em></strong><dt>Invisitext Indicator is invisible</dt><dd>Not all users experience this, but as far as i can tell it occurs because, for whatever reason, the inherited text-decoration-color is set to "transparent" instead of the default body text color. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy fix for this.  However, you can workaround it by using the advanced option Override Underline Color to specify a non-transparent color for the indicator.</dd></dl>
──────────────────────────<dl><strong><em>Advanced Options:</em></strong>
<dt><b>Override Underline Color</b> - Changes the underline color used to indicate invisitext from the webpage default to the fixed value indicated in "Overridden Underline Color".  This change is <em>GLOBAL</em> for all sites covered by this style.</dt>
<dd>This option addresses <A HREF="http://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/20315148/">instances</A> where the author of a post included nested color tags (i.e. <code>[COLOR="RED"][COLOR="transparent"]InvisiText[/COLOR][/COLOR]</code>) that override the default color scheme (in this example causing the underline created by this style to show up in red).</dd>

<b><u>RELEASE NOTES:</u></b>
<b>Release 1.2.0</b> - Updated style to work with XenForo 2.0.  It looks like the reveal on hover code is working for 2.0 (unlike 1.0) as well.

<b>Release 1.1.4</b> - Updated the Reveal Text option to include <code>!important</code>.  The Always Reveal text option should be fixed now.

<b>Release 1.1.3</b> - Made minor updates to the description and altered the CSS selectors to be slightly more specific.

<b>Release 1.1.2</b> - Reorganized the options into Regular and Advanced sections to indicate that some options should only be used in special cases.

<b>Release 1.1.1</b> - Fixed a rare issue whereby the invisitext indicator would itself be hidden as invisitext.  Apparently the text-decoration color is <code>!important</code>.

<b>Release 1.1.0</b> - You can now override the color this style will underline invisitext with (it defaults to 'inherit', which should make the underline color match the color scheme of the website).

<b>Release 1.0.2</b> - The style will now handle color tags where "TRANSPARENT" is typed in uppercase.  This is in addition to the existing proper case and lowercase recognition.

<b>Release 1.0.1</b> - Gave up on waiting for userstyles to create a screenshot and took some myself.  Also fixed more typos in the description and tweaked the text of each dropdown option to start with a capital letter.  <em>There were no changes to the style itself.</em>

<b>Release 1.0</b> - Fixed up some typos, rewrote the description, and gave an example page for userstyles to take a screenshot of.

<b>Release 0.6</b> - Added the ability to choose the color to highlight text with.

<b>Release 0.5</b> - Added the option to reveal text always, instead of only on hover/touch.

<b>Release 0.4</b> - Added QuestionableQuesting as a supported forum.

<b>Release 0.3</b> - Added the option to completely disable the underlining of invisitext.

<b>Release 0.2</b> - Added the option to make the background of invisitext Black.  This increases compatibility with Firefox Mobile.

<b>Release 0.1</b> - Initial release.  Underlines invisitext with a dotted line and reveals gold text when the mouse hovers over it.
