### Description
This theme has been merged into <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/172851/deviantart-show-titles-eclipse-classic>DeviantArt+ show Titles (Eclipse+Classic)</a> which works on both the new and old version of the site and also includes has customization options.

Restores titles to pictures in DeviantArt galleries and adds a border around all images, adds a red border around around NSFW images (like FA), and has nice hover effects.

Looks best in my opinion with <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/160557/nocturnal-deviantart-theme-fork-sta-sh>Nocturnal Theme Fork</a>
