### Description
* Enlarges player to fit browser width without breaking anything. Now Even Larger!
* Moves "Guide" to the right of the search bar.
* Works perfectly on playlists.
* Removes space between player and the youtube header.
* Hides the annoying warning-box that appears for viewers who are using google apps domain accounts.

NOTE: You should click the larger player icon on the player if you do not want the playlist to open every-time it changes to next video. You can't switch between large and small player, but this is planned for a future release.
