~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<B>**IMPORTANT**</B> <I>For those who have been using A Blue Night, this theme will, upon official release, replace it. In the mean time, <B>please disable A Blue Night before installing this theme</B> as for not doing so will cause a lot of glitches to occur. It is always recommended you have only one theme per site enabled unless the creator of said theme explicitly says that it is safe to use with other themes.

Additionally, please make sure that <B>You have the latest version of your browser installed</B> as this theme uses a lot of CSS3 transitions. If you do not have the latest version installed, please install it prior to getting this theme.</I>

### Update notes

v0.90 (Beta) |- Feb. 09, 2013.-|

First Beta release of A Dark Night. I know it is not fully styled, but most sections are by now and they all feature real smooth effects along with an elegant layout. In time, I will bring all the options from A Blue Night over and finish applying the resources to the poorly-looked areas of Moco.

Hang in there guys, and enjoy. ;]

- Much much more... In a distant future.
