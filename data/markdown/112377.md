### Description
The aim of this style changed drastically. Initially a small standalone release (forked from a dark redesign of Hitbox which became obsolete after the official release of a dark theme) with one basic feature (Display tables on stream pages centred), it is starting to grow into a little bit more.

It is still very basic, but I do hope you enjoy the small changes.

### Update notes
2015-04.13: Added option to display Played Game by streamer on front page. Per default Hitbox displays this information on hover. Fixed 'Hide Live Player' option.

2015-04-09: Added option to hide Live Player on front page. Added choice between 320px and 350px table width. Added choice between centred table and Hitbox Default. Renamed into 'Clean Hitbox'.

2015-04-08: Style released {While working on this I did not notice any bugs elsewhere on the site, but if you do, please notice me}
