### Description
The new 8tracks layout introduces some hideous, hard-to-read font. I don't know if this is Firefox specific or not, as it does look slightly better in Chrome, but either way it's not something I find pleasing so I've coded a simple way to fix it.

### Update notes
<b>July 21, 2014</b> - now fixes a few size issues caused by the font changes

<b>June 10, 2014</b> - updated to catch more instances of the font
