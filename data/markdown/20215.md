### Description
This is for FF3.5 and later.  The userstyle I used to remove "Open All in Tabs" in previous FF versions no longer works.  

This script removes "Open All in Tabs" from the Bookmarks Toolbar dropdown and also removes the separator.

The "Open All in Tabs" option from the dropdown drives me nuts because I never use it and it gets in the way.  I've seen a few posts about how to remove this but they don't remove the separator.  This script removes both.  Enjoy!
