### Description
Not sure why these scripts never work on the OSX version of Firefox.  I mucked together some code and learned more about XUL than I cared to figure out.  Favicons have squared hover backgrounds to take up less space on the bookmark bar.  Sites without favicons stay as they were.

It's a huge increase in available real estate for bookmarks.
