### Description
This is almost a complete remake of css for the game Pardus. 
Some of the features:
- nav grid and highlight of mouse-hovered fields
- Some of links positioned fixed for convenient access
- Faction Relations list readable, unlike original
- Makes Bulletin boards look compact in a way (to disable, you have to delete everything from bulletin boards comment, to tables comment)
- better space usage in some places

Be informed, that this works faster as userstyle used via Stylish, than a userScript on FF.
