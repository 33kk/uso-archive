### Description
Normally in Firefox if you put an icon on the left of the Toolbar its padding is only 2 pixel, on the other hand if you put an icon on the right side of the Toolbar its padding is 5px. This simple script fix this problem, as you can see from the screenshot, and now everything is perfectly spaced. Thank you <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/24991">freecyber</a> for the help.
