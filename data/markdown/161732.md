### Description
I don't know if it's because Cengage hates me and my Firefox browser personally, but the tables and text are very tightly condensed and magnifying wasn't really giving me a nicer look. So I made some small changes, which ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿I'm sharing in case I wasn't the only one with poor eyesight and luck. Please note, the site is still ugly; I just made it more legible. The site's design makes it difficult for a lot of changes to quickly be made and I have homework.
