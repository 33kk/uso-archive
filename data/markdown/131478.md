### Description
This is a set of small tweaks for the default look of TweetDeck (the light one).

Features :
- Round avatars
- Smoother font : Fira Sans (Included in base64)
- Less sharp borders
- Alternating subtle background colors for tweets (Replacing the sharp lines seperating tweets)
- Better and more elegant style for quoted tweets

The idea here is to make some small changes here and there so that TweetDeck has a smoother look overall, with less lines, that is easier on the eyes.
