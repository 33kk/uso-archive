### Description
Many pages of this old site render with unreadable wide columns on modern widescreen monitors. This is a _work_in_progress_ style to first pull in the width of the whole page to no more than 60em, and then selectively limit elements from the main flow of articles such as paragraphs and list items to a readable width. Unfortunately the wiki text is sitting in one big div rather than being packaged into paragraph elements so the whole div needs to be narrowed.
