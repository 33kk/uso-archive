### Description
This is for all the forum diehards to save a little wear and tear on your scroll finger. When you are in the forums there is a handy list of links to the other forums under the left site navigation menu, but the site menu has gotten so long that you have to scroll down all the time to see the other links. This script will simply hide the site's navigation, which brings the forum links up higher for easy access.

Updated! Thanks to Kemie for the Bit-O-Code to hide the "Need Help" div too!
