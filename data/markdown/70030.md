### Description
Easier, low-contrast reading. The Wikipedia div is far too wide for readability on widescreen monitors. I narrowed that div down to 750px and darkened the same div's background color to lower the contrast between it and the typeface. I hope your eyes feel better with this change. Still experimenting with fonts. I'm using a non-websafe font "Myriad Pro" followed by "Trebuchet MS" and Verdana (both websafe).  Let me know your thoughts. And check out my other styles.
