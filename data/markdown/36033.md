### Description
UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NOT READY FOR GENERAL USAGE

IPT has horrible design coding, very little CSS and very much hardcoded stuff.
This is ongoing attempt to fix it a bit.

Many buttons and layouts are still broken as I have no time to finish it, but due to demand here's the version I use.
