### Description
this theme is for the website deviantart. it is a dark/monochromish theme. i have created this theme for my own personal use because i can't find any decent dark/gothic themes that work with the new deviantart. THIS IS A BETA THEME AND IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK PROPERLY!!

NOTE: This theme is currently broken and does NOT work with Eclipse! I will make it work with Eclipse soon.
