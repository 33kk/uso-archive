### Description
White background for the site Dumpr.net - a online photo editing suite which allows you to perform Photoshop-like effects on your images.

Features:
+ Makes dumpr look much more professional by removing the orange background
+ More attractive and business-like
+ Looks a lot less like a freeware, ad infested site (like it did before this style)

Feel free to customize the background color.  I thought white was best.

Changelog:
- Initial Release
