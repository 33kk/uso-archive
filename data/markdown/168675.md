### Description
Get's rid of the worst issues when installing said theme. Not perfect, but should be better at least. Doesn't look as much as the original, but more like a dark theme in general.

The more original CSS, the smaller the change it breaks soon, I hope. Therefore, I kept the default blue on places like the side bar.
