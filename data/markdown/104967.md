### Description
This style strips the ads, as well as the left and right rails for articles. You are left with a widescreen browsing experience. Font is capped at 16px (it was too big at 20px) and videos are fixed at 720p for previews within the article. They can also be turned off entirely via the toggle on the install page here.

### Update notes
1.0 (9/3/2014) - Initial release.
