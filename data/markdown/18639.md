### Description
Nothing fancy here just the Google search page cleaned up, simplified, and multicolumn. You can change the colors very easily since the code is very simple and easily modified. I just like the color because it saves my eyes. :-)  Easy enough to change the color.... open the style and at the bottom there is the color section (just one spot), easy to find since I comment my code, and change to your liking. 

- Not going to actively keep this updated since it truly is a pain in the but to keep up with Google style changes. If you happen to find an error post it on this page and I will make every effort to make the changes for others to download.
