### Description
www.imdb.com recently updated their website with a modified design putting the pages into a fixed width.

That's all very well, but i like viewing this particular website at 100% width.

Use the following small style to get it back to 100% width.

Screenshots not provided as it's such a small code, i'll include screenshots if i decide to start changing the rest of the look.

UPDATE: Removal of top ads etc... minor change...

Code tested regarding trailer page, seems to work fine now.... The original trailer was larger then normal, i can see the IMDB have resized their trailers and the problem has gone as a result.
