### Description
This userstyle aims to hide as many GCash-related user interface elements as possible, for those who are tired of looking at anything related to it. It also includes my Toned-Down Promoted Posts userstyle, and cleans up the My Gaia page a bit.

ALL changes and removals are labeled, please look through the CSS and delete what you want back (perhaps the counter showing how much GC you have).

It's still possible to access the cash shop through certain buttons and menus, but they aren't very obnoxious.
