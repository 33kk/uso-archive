### Description
This is a style that darkens the webpage on socrative.org when taking a test. Normally, it is a bright white that can get annoying. This style fixes the white and replaces it with dark colors that are easier on the eyes.
Don't change the colors if you just want the Midnight scheme.

### Update notes
v1.1: added customization 3/13/17
v1.0: released 3/12/17
