### Description
<p>*Dear users! Stylish became way less popular thing since controversy with user data. There's new better way to have dark mode everywhere across the web called 'Dark Reader' extension. It does pretty same job as I did manually. So my styles are no more supported.*</p>
<p>Dark grey background, optimal contrast for reading.</p>
<p>Continuosly updated</p>
<p>Guys, you can always ask to add urls...</p>
<p>Also applies for: uxdesign.cc, prototypr.io, blog.framer.com, uxplanet.org, medium.freecodecamp.org, medium.muz.li, hackernoon.com, writingcooperative.com, 500ish.com.</p>
