### Description
This style is for both Firefox and palemoon.

Based on Elian's great style 104409 (I recommend you to check all of his styles).

Elian's firefox version of this style had mainly 2 issues in palemoon :
- the Pale Moon app menu (the menu pallete popping after u click the Pale Moon big button)
- The bookmarks drop-down menu

I also made some other changes like making the font of the menu items bigger.
