### Description
A dark theme for GitLab. White is so hard on the eyes, this theme focuses on a dark interface that highlights and accentuates frequently used/read areas. I am still working on it and I know there are things that I have not encountered yet so check back for updates. Make sure to change the domain if you are using Firefox or delete the "@-moz-document" part for Chrome.
