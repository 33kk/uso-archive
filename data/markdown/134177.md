### Description
Make your school ManageBac student website follow the Material Design guidelines!

### Update notes
NO LONGER WORKS WITH THE NEW MANAGEBAC LAYOUT.


The ManageBac Material Design style follows the Material Design guidelines pretty loyally on the sidebar. The margins and paddings are thought to be exactly the same as on the guidelines themselves.

You can choose your own main color, which will be used as the color for your links and the active state of the tabs.

The background image will be used as the background of the page. A blurred image is recommended, since it's just supposed to be a background. The Sidebar background image is used at the top of the sidebar, as the background of your profile. I have three options, which all work pretty good, if you have the right color scheme.
