### Description
This theme let's you choose whatever color you want for your button colors and some font colors and also your background image. The default colors will be approximately what they would be without any theme. You may be able to customize more with this theme in the future  so check back for updates.

How to customize your theme: (note: Please use the "Stylus" extension and not the "Stylish" one when using this theme. It is hard/impossible to use customizable themes with stylish. Install stylus for chrome here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en-GB)
1. Install  the  theme
2. Reload the page and if the button you clicked to install the theme now says "Update Style" on it then you can continue to step 3. If not reload again until it does show that.
3. Click the "Customize Settings" button and choose your colors and/or background image and  then click "Update Style" 
Done!
