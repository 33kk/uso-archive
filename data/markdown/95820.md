### Description
This style gives you maximum control over the look of your scrollbars with the fewest lines of code. This style matches any theme you throw at it thanks to having over 1000 different combinations. Thankfully, your flashy new scrollbars are un-intrusive thanks to the fact that they float over the page and are unlikely to interfere with page contents; and if floating is too much for you, feel free to enable autohiding. Compatible with most Gecko based browsers. Refresh the page after installing to see results.

### Update notes
Changelog:
V1.6: Made the scrollbar button option actually look good and adjust size based on other options.
V1.5.2: Changed margin option to size so that it would be more evident about what it does. Note that "large" is the same size at the normal size for the default when using FT Deepdark for some reason.
V1.5.1: Code regarding borders removed when not in use. Added option for fading effects.
V1.5: Added glow and shadow effects with related options.
V1.4.1: Added separate color option for borders. Added size option for borders. Added alpha transparency option for borders. Added an option to enable or disable autohiding.
V1.4: Added optional padding, enabled by default. Changed the name because I felt like it and the old one doesn't match the current focus.
V1.3: Added various border options to play with.
V1.2.2: Added color options and an option to enable or disable scrollbar arrows. Added option to reduce side margin to fix minor issue with certain custom themes.
V1.2.1: Added option to choose between unrounded or rounded edges.
V1.2: Prevents "complete themes" from modifying the appearance (in most cases).
V1.1: Now fades between colors and transparencies on webpage elements such as text boxes (Getting the effect to work on the main scrollbars is another story).
V1: Initial Release

Please leave feedback and suggestions.

Known issues:
Scrollbar arrows don't seem to work right on mac.
