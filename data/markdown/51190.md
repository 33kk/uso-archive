### Description
Makes NOAA dark. I made this for personal use and didn't bother styling pages I don't view. 7-day forecast, hourly weather graph and satellite imagery pages are styled. I drastically changed the layout of the satellite imagery page, so if it looks messed up let me know.

I animated the warning spans (such as "Hazardous weather outlook"). The code may not work in all browsers, though.

07/02/21 update:
They redesigned the forecast pages. I think it looks better than their old ones, but now my style is broken. I have real life projects to work on right now so I may not get around to fixing this for a little while. If anyone wants to edit it you have my permission; no need to contact me, just edit to your heart's content.
