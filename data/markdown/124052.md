### Description
No thumbnails, no video player, no footer, no comments. You just want to use Youtube as a radio. Pairs well with plugins like uBlockOrigin (or any decent ad blocker). I test my userstyle CSS while I have DarkTube (https://userstyles.org/styles/117673/darktube) enabled as well to make sure it's compatible.

This is an especially useful style when you're trying to listen to hip hop, rap, electronica since every thumbnail and video is all t&a which makes it hard to watch at work.

updated 16 March 2016: video controls don't autohide. Also each video summary now contains the video duration, which was lost when I removed the thumbnails originally.
