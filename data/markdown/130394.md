### Description
Minimalist style for urban dictionary, based on the style by antonomasia, with some small changes, such as removing a box, centering it to the middle of the screen and making the links orangeyellow.

Mostly intended to be used together with duckduckgo's "!" bang search function.

Bear in mind that it can not be used together with any other of urbandictionary.com's pages other than the "no result found page", and the result pages. So if you for example wish to add definitions to words, the userstyle breaks.
