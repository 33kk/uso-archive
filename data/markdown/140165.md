### Description
This style changes the popup when you click the stylish extension. It adds a background to it. It looks nicer than plain white.

### Update notes
I am working on a way to also include the page when you edit and manage your styles.
v1.0 Released 3/15/17

I was just curious to see if you could change the popup. It actually works well.
