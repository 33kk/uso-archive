### Description
An edit of style 37325 by user 63339. Like my edit of style 33248 by user 55661 ( style 39707 ) before it, it moves content to the left, while leaving the board title at the right. It also removes the background image. Some color tweaks are present, as well as a few tweaks to get it to play nice with some chrome extensions (4chan plus, specifically).

EOL Update: Fixed regular reply, text colors, syntax errors, a problem with padding, and other things.
