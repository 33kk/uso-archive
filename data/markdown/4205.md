### Description
This style is for anyone who is sick and tired of having to navigate through all the useless apps and spam that has been filling Facebook lately. The purpose of this style is to remove any mention of a third party app on all of Facebook. This style will greatly change your facebook experience.

Note: This is a port of my greasemonkey userscript http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11992

I always knew it was better to do this with CSS :-)

You must be on crack. I can use my "Write Note" tab just fine.
