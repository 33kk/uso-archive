### Description
An inverted style for the <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> web interface, with light font on dark background. Meaningful colors are preserved as much as possible (e.g. red for errors, yellow for warnings...), but I might have missed some corner cases. Feedback is welcome.
