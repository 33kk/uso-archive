### Description
Makes the new myspace forum layout look similar to the old one.

Update 3:
Myspace removed the top sort menu.
I've now accommodated for this.

Update 2:
After breaking the thread 5 times on the same page
the following posts header would stretch to the top
It no longer does.

Update 1: 
Minor fixes regarding the div bug.
Changed the thread header.
A few things load better.
