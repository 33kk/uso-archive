### Description
GDocs Dark Gold converts Google Docs (the actual documents, not Drive) to a color scheme that is much easier on the eyes. For all my fellow late-night writers out there, you're welcome.

Black text will automatically be displayed as white text. It is nonetheless quite black. Changing the color even a little will reveal this, as the CSS only inverts true black text. All other colors remain the same.
