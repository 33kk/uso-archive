### Description
Updated November 13th (and previously end of October) because of element name changes.
Many thanks (AGAIN) to Moktoipas for solving this new element problem; I had it almost nailed but wasn't "getting it perfect."

If icons are not the right size for your liking, try going smaller on the Height and Padding "Px" numbers.  These work for me in 1280x1024.

This is based on the original GREAT Moktoipas script for giving attachment icons in your GMail.  Invaluable for sorting through emails and seeing if an attachment is a "known" or "common" filetype.  I have shortened the original  script to 5k by making icons simpler (shorter base64 code), and combining Word, Excel and Text into one icon.  I have eliminated .exe, since GMail won't allow you to send those anyway.  I tested "dangerous" file types with an exclamation mark, but it was moot since GMail won't allows those to be sent either (vbs, etc).  Also optimized the code and changed some syntax, so now images, pdf, zip, text and css files (separate for those of us who send user content/chrome/js stuff to each other) have their own icon.  So if you see the "paper clip" on an email - careful!
