### Description
Cleans up Greasemonkey's toolbar button by hiding the actual icon and making the menu drop marker the new icon.

1.0.5/2016-12-19 UPDATE: I've stopped using FXChrome ages ago in favor of Firefox Developer Edition and its theme and this little user style still could. Maybe it's time to drop the theme namedrop. ;) This latest update removes a lot of unnecessary seeming definitions but please do let me know if I broke it for you.
