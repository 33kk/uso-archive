### Description
I've tried a few different styles, and I just couldn't find what I wanted. So, I tried my hand at making one for myself.

I tend to sit in a dark room while using my computer, and staring at bright white websites is hard on the eyes. So, I put this together, I know it's not perfect or anything, I'm just lucky I was able to do it at all.

I hope someone finds it helpful to them. :)
