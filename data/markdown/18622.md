### Description
Shows position-numbers in Google.de resultpages (SERPs) with awareness of local results and news in front of the actual results. As of CustomizeGoogle's current non-development status, another solution had to be found.
Known "issues":
When clicking on page 2 and so on, it won't add the last 10 results to the positions, so it will be number 1 again.
If anyone has a working solution, please contact me at contact@lestarte.com!
UPDATE 13-04-29: Google changed the SERP-code again, div class=vsc is now h3 class=r
UDPATE 12-01-13: Fix after changes from Google.
UDPATE 11-09-07: Counts only the real positions (after changes from Google).
UDPATE 09-07-15: Does work now even when you are logged in.
