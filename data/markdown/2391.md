### Description
This changes the font of the article text on WashingtonPost.com from the default "Times New Roman" to the font family "verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" and the font size from "1.5em" to "12px".

I have trouble with how this works...  If anyone could tell me why, and how to fix it, I'd appreciate it.  If you load this into Stylish, it doesn't appear to work when you first go to the site.  If you disable it and then enable it, then the font will change.  If you click a link, then the font goes back to Times New Roman.  If you disable and enable, then the font will change again.  The font will also change if you preview the script in the Stylish editing window.
