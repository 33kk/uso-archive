### Description
--DEAD STYLE--

A YouTube style using the Ubuntu and GeoSansLight fonts. Improving the appearance of the site in a minimal sense while also keeping the functionality. Inspired by other styles used for last.fm and what.cd as well as hdni's themes (http://hdni.github.io/dotfiles/#userchrome). Support for ViewTube is added but users will need to change line 342 in viewtube's .user.js: from 'div' to 'viewtube'
This was originally developed as a custom, personal edit of RÃ©tro YouTube (http://userstyles.org/styles/85424/r-tro-youtube) by Spf. I later changed more than i expected and ended up with this.
