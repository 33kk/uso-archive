### Description
Just removes the ads.  Btw,  generally speaking I'm not an "ad hater"..  (Digg has done a great job and I'd like to make sure they reap all the ad related revenue that they can). I just started to get annoyed with the video ads that Digg's ad network is serving up.. well not that annoyed but annoyed enough to put this style together.

This style is again dirt simple.. just remove "msads" elements.
