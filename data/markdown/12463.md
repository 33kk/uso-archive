Comment/Review replies::
vbielawski - I had a look at the site mentioned and although the icons are very alike, they are not the same. If you can reference some actual links to the icons on famfamfam i'll happily update the code with credit.
UPDATE: Found them, will update the code, i stand corrected.... which is not a problem...
