### Description
I made this style to go along with style 24339

I would have included this in the Reddit Redux style but it looked odd with some of the greasemonkey scripts that modify Reddit's comment section. I figured it would be better to separate it and give people the option of adding the style to the comments separately.

Specifics:
- background/border for each individual comment
- mouseover action on the upmod/downmod arrows
- rounded borders

See style 24339 for a full list of features of the Reddit Redux style.
