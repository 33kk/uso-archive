### Description
This stylesheet is able to Highlight Help Articles of search results on Google Help Center.

Because, Search results in the Help Center include both help articles and forum topics.
However, it is hard to distinguish between them by only small icons and texts.
I thought that this was bad for cognitive science, then I created this style sheet to easy to identify help articles.
