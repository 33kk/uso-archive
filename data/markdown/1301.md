### Description
Warns you if a link is to a pdf, exe, mailto, or anything not that isn't a web page. It does this by placing an icon after the link. See the picture for more details. You can personalize it to your own needs by adding or removing your own file types.

This style uses icons from Windows. Linux users, check out style 1344. Mac users, do you guys even use Firefox? This system isn't foolproof because it merely checks the end of the url. Also, this style works in Gecko only.

Inspired by style 53, style 48, style 958, and style 1305.

Supported types: .pdf, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .7z, .zip, .rar, .exe, .msi, .mov, .m3u, .pls, .asx, mp3, .avi., .wma, .wmv, .mpg, .wav, mailto:
