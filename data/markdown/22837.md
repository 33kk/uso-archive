### Description
This should enable native scrollbars in Google Wave (and hide those wacky scrollthings).

This works for me... and now Wave is much faster when scrolling.

Updates:

2009-11-26: Now the scrollbars do not show up unless needed!
2009-12-08: Google Wave was updated, so I fixed the classes to make things work again.
2010-01-09: Another Google Wave update; another class fix.
2010-01-31: Yet another another Google Wave update; so another fix.
2010-02-19: Yet another another Google Wave update...
2010-03-04: You know the drill...
