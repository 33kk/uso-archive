### Description
This simple style file only applies to ft.com article pages (URLs starting with ft.com/cms/s/).
The texts' sizes in the original design is too small, making my eyes feel strain while reading them displayed on white background. So I made this to improve the readability and as well removed some useless contents located on the right-hand side of each article.
