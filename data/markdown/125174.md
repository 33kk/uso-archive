### Description
The Debian site allows columns of text to be wider than the optimal line length for comprehension and scannability. They are often allowed grow to fill the full width of a browser window.

This style pulls in the widths of paragraphs, list items, definitions and so on to make columns of text which are closer to having the ideal line length.
