### Description
NOTE: DOES NOT WORK WITH WEBEXTENSIONS LIKE STYLUS! WebExtensions are not allowed to run on AMO!

Mozilla made this dumb move to remove the favorites and collections buttons from the add-on detail pages, because "they're not used very often". This userstyle reverts this dumb move and brings back the buttons where they belong.
