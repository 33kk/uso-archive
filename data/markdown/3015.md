### Description
This tiny userscript adds a basic keyword background highlighting to google search results and a little margin on the left.
Note that the dots are also highlighted and the amount of them represents the distance between the quoted parts of the page.

Works again though I got rid of the margin :P.

Please post reviews ;).
