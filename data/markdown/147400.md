### Description
For those who are Whirled veterans, this skin was originally made to cover up the white-wakey blank parts that whirled had unfortunately gave us a downgraded version of it's UI. It made no logical sense as to why they removed the 2008 interface and replaced it with a blinding white crappy eyesore. Now it's an optional skin that can be used on any Whirled clone for nostalgia sake. Just make sure to change the domain name for the Whirled clone you want used in the first line of the CSS.

Note: This CSS is also open sourced, feel free to also edit the contents inside to your own liking.
