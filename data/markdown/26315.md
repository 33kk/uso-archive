### Description
Fixes the absolute positioning on "TV 2.0" "720p 5.1" etc labels when browsing episodes on TVTorrents.com, so that they line up regardless of how the list is rendered.  If there are any missing images on the list, please let me know.  One side effect is that the plain (TV) and unknown labels appear larger than before, this is to accommodate repositioning the show logo relative to the label.
