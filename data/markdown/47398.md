Changes the background of the help > about firefox.

Any image can be used but the size needs to be about 620 x 308. Bigger pictures don't load well.

### Update notes
*** How to change the background to your own image ***
1.) find or resize an image 620 x 308
2.) upload it to image hosting site of your choice
3.) where it says "background-image: url("....")", replace what's in the dots with the direct link to your image
4.) save, close, and you should have a custom background for your about firefox menu
