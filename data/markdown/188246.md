### Description
A Light CSS for Glimesh! 

-Why did I make this? I was bored...I uploaded it only because my friend said I wouldn't do anything with it (he was right...till he pointed it out. now he's wrong. :^ )

-Why is this bad? im bad at css

-I have issues?! same. But uhh press leave feedback (or email me its in the pics)

if this breaks (it'll break) because of launch, I'll try to keep it updated :]. 

that was english but userstyles site is bad and will time out :[
