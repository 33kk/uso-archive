### Description
This style is a companion for my style 11912  (it is NOT usable without "parent" style).

What this style does:
       1.       Surrounds each style's name with a border to make the look more stylish.  (Hover effect is added as well.)
       2.       "Edit" link is moved to the end of the box to ease readability.

For those of you who liked the idea of transforming style's names into buttons OR doesn't like numbering of the results - take a look at the bottom section of the style.
