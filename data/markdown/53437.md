### Description
All the blinky things go away for a quasi-theatre mode. 
Enough left for logging in, loading up the next episode, or asking Geoff about his pants. 
Great accompaniment for those with computers that think slow.

Does *not* remove in-video ads, so that should make the pinheads happy.

Oh, I think it will work for other CBS shows. Huh.
