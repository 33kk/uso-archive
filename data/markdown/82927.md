### Description
For anyone that's interested, I've submitted a user style that I have created to userstyles.org that allows you to see much more information at a time than in the default theme for the GO web UI. By cutting out a lot of the white space via rearranging the pipeline groups into vertical lists, you can see a greater amount of pipelines simultaneously (IE. without scrolling)

This has been tested in Firefox 18 and Chrome 24

NOTE: You will need to change the URLs that this user style attaches to, as by default it will only work on the caplin.com domain!
