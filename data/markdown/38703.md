### Description

Just like GMail, I've long felt that HBO's forums are a successful community in spite of how they look, rather than because of it. This being the case I set to the task of creating a user stylesheet to pummel it into something a little more pleasing on the (well, my) eye. I've also stripped away a lot of the extraneous gubbins on the forum to pare it down to the base experience, so things like daily challenges, recent news articles and other sundry links are no longer visible.

A few screenshots follow (images link to fullsize versions). The code is available to download (or fork) on github, should anybody else want to use it. A word of warning though: this stylesheet is pretty much built with Safari 5 in mind, and it may not work well at all elsewhere. I certainly shouldn't expect it'll work well in any version of Internet Explorer. That said, if you spot bugs (in Safari) please let me know and I'll try to patch it where possible.
