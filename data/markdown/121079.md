### Description
This theme causes Firefox to generally blend in with other applications when one of the GTK themes <a href="http://nale12.deviantart.com/art/Flattastic-11-03-2014-424913255">"Flattastic ____ Light"</a> is applied.  Since the GTK Native extension stopped working on Firefox 29, integration with my desktop has been poor; this style improves matters.

The Blue option also integrates passably well with the stock Adwaita GTK theme.

### Update notes
I claim no credit for the original GTK themes by nale12.
