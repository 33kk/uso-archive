### Description
<b>I've enclosed in-depth & easy directions so you can adjust the code accordingly to your liking.</b>
What it says on the tin, a small formatting edit to make the new post page aesthetically bearable, complete with borders and the post and cancel button switched back, as well as a smaller title font.
If you face any additional issues or problems, contact me <a href="http://eatyourheirs.tumblr.com/">@eatyourheirs</a>.

### Update notes
Updates:

2/1 - I added an optional code to switch 'discard' and 'nevermind' because I keep hitting the wrong one.
2/6 - Just realized I never switched the inbox buttons and that's why I haven't responded to anyones messages in like a week.
7/1 - Code Updated
1/20 - Minor code & format updates. Actually shrinks the title box again. The border boxes are still broken, unfortunately.
