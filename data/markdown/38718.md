### Description
This is based on style 33879 which in turn is based on style 33832
The main differences: more obvious "points" count in threaded discussions to draw attention to high count comments while also allowing you to easily weed out comments with low counts.
And larger [-] to more easily collapse entire sub-threads.

( The "before" pic below uses style 33832 to illustrate the primary differences )
