### Description
I did an ESPN Fantasy Baseball and Fantasy Sports dark, so did this one for Streak to match the others...Will update as needed...You can check my profile to see what it will look like by viewing the Dark Baseball or Dark Fantasy...Basically the same color scheme...

-- ESPN added wide background. Edit to remove it as it is not necessary. ** 7/16/10 ** --

-- Fixed issue with your pending pick not having distinct background color ** 3/20/10 ** --

-- Small edit to have your entry highlighted should you be in a group; other minor color changes ** 3/16/10 ** --
