### Description
It's a new style of 4chan.
1) yellow-on-grey, like power tools. manly power tools.
2) implements user 62774's sliding postbox (which is pretty ballin')
3) navbar animates (everyone loves animation)
4) uses Tango color palette
5) apart from point 2, a new style from the ground up.
6) lighter than the black-like-my-soul themes, but still a low contrast for today's basement dweller.
