### Description
4chan's default stylesheets are worthless.  Use this to make it better.  Unless you are also worthless, that is.

Background element is blatantly ripped off from vC's Google - dark grey redesign.  Also, this is basically a huge mod of HURR.

So yeah.

I might add screenshots later if I'm not too lazy.  It's dark, using greys and black.  Preview if you don't trust me.
