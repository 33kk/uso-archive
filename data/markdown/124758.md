### Description
PF is cluttered, hard to use, and full of useless features no one cares about. Foundation (code by King Vesper) removes anything not absolutely essential to the game. Gone are avatars, signatures, backgrounds, borders, icons, and more!

This does not break the rules. Support for Ads will be added when they are introduced. 

This style is a WIP. 
Optimized for 2 & 3 Column View.
