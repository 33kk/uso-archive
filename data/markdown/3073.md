### Description
The articles on http://www.itv-f1.com/ are very narrow; it's okay if you're using a Windows95 PC from 1995, but most of us have larger windows now.

This assumes a full-width 1200x1600 display; of course, you can change the "width" element to whatever you would prefer to use.

I added a small amount of padding, also, because it looks too cluttered otherwise.
