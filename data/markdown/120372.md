### Description
Following on from my <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/101946/google-search-simple-clarity-minimal">Google Clarity</a> style, here is a version for Bing.

This style makes the info on <a href="https://www.bing.com/"><b>Bing</b></a> easier to see at a glance. The most noticeable change is regarding the result titles, which have a bluish-grey box around them. Image results (the title in main results) has green box and news results has yellow box. 

<b>Knowledge graph</b> is light-ish grey, which I will probably change to a light cream yellow soon.
