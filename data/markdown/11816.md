### Description
I've moved account from Fanwashere, I am the original author of this theme.
Basilmarket LITE is a Beta theme I am creating for Basilmarket. I am almost complete and will soon be moving onto my second Basilmarket theme, Basilmarket TwiLITE (I'm telling you this to reserve the name xD). 

I've completely recoded the entire theme. Thanks to my Mental Breakdown and my "I can't do it"s, Basilmarket LITE looks better than ever.
The GUI got a complete facelift. It looks really cool and shiny. 
WARNING: The Forums are completely messed up.

Basilmarket LITE Countdown: 75%!

Updates~~~~~
-The Logo and the Genesis background is now at the left where the Logo used to be. You can see the entire Genesis skill now.
-The Menu is still moved up. Except this time I didn't have to use much code to make that happen. Also made it less glitchy.
-Clock was taken out.
-Search Bar moved up.
-Ads Removed.
-Gave the GUI a Makeover, Main Page looks completely different now.
