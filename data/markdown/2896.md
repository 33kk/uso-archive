### Description
Liqube printable style.

This style will try to remove all the basic junk from a website to make it as printable as possible, using Georgia as main font (you can change that easily by editing the font name inside the style). Mainly intended for black and white printing and or people who just want to save some toner or simply prefer reading it in plain text, like me. You can also use this style for easier copy/paste into Office applications, eg. turn this style on, copy/paste, turn this style off again. This will remove most of the annoying HTML formattings.

Let me know if like this or if you find it useful :) Thanks
