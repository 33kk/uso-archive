### Description
Mainly aimed to clean the Wikia pages from the Fandom influence, and more. Also featuring some customizable settings to suit your needs, such as wide page, slim/detached top bar, along with options for what not to hide. Works on most (if not all) Wikia pages.

### Update notes
The default settings are for pure browsing experience, with zero community interactions. If you are unhappy with a change on the page, you can always click on the "Customize Settings" button over here and select a different option for a setting (or edit the relevant parts out on the CSS). 

There may be some unintended / unforeseen results with the Slim top bar, if you experience any issues, or have any suggestions, let me know! Have a nice day!

<b>Update (April 29, 2019): </b> Fixed "Search Adjustments" option. Search bar now properly grows to full size. Even though this is left as an option, I highly recommend leaving it enabled.

Aside from that, transparency on full page width has been reduced. Have a nice day!

<b>Update (December 12, 2018): </b> Some Wikia's seem to have been moved to Fandom domain. This update just adds that domain as another target.

<b>Update (July 13, 2018): </b> Hides some of the most obvious ads that appear on the page. I don't get to see any ads even without an ad-blocker, so I might have missed a few. If you are using an ad-blocker, you won't feel any changes at all. 

Aside from that, a few things related to new settings are tidied up.

<b>Update (July 12, 2018): </b> Adds a new setting, "Search Adjustments" which is enabled by default. As there can be some unforeseen issues, I decided to leave it as an option.

When enabled, the Search button will be centered and span the entire blank area of the top bar. Should you experience issues with it, you can disable it through options. 

As a side note, some internals (related to customizable options; in "technical" terms, the install keys of the options) have been changed. It might cause unintended side effects, and may require a clean reinstall of the style, but I believe it won't be the case.

<b>Update (July 11, 2018): </b> Brings two new settings, "Nav Bar Style" and "Page Width". 

For "Nav Bar Style", you can select between 4 options: "Slim", "Detached", "Both" and "Normal". Slim compresses the top bar a little, and is selected by default. If you don't like it, select Normal through options and update the style; Normal effectively does nothing. Detached makes the top bar stick to the page rather than to the browser. 

For "Page Width", you can select between 2 options: "Normal" and "Wide". Normal effectively does nothing, and is selected by default, but if you want the article to cover the whole page, you can select the "Wide" option instead.

And lastly, Wikia has received an update which made some changes to the top bar, and made some of the buttons visible again. This style update addresses those as well.
