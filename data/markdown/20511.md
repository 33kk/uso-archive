### Description
Dreamwidth.org's site scheme has a max-width property of 80em. Particularly when using bigger or even widescreen monitors, this causes a lot of empty space to appear on either site of pages. (See screenshot.) This tiny bit of CSS changes 80em to 100%, thus reducing the amount of empty space by a lot. (See screenshot.)

Note: I haven't found an instance where this *breaks* anything, though when default comment pages are used, the comments don't respect this new setting, and text entry boxes like on the post entry page don't stretch to fit the new width either. If someone knows how to fix those things via CSS, please let me know! moonie.dw at gmail dot com
