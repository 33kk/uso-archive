### Description
The game Screen in <a href"http://www.kongregate.com/">Kongregate</a> Games is now a lot bigger and the Chat is hidden. Minimum resolution supported is 1440x900, if your screen is less than 900 pixel high then the game won't fit! I tested it only in <a href"ttp://www.kongregate.com/games/oivoi/soccer-physics!>Soccer Physics</a>, so I don't know how it works for other games. Give me some feedbacks / requests!
