### Description
Thins ModDB's header by removing the enormous platform selection tabs and downscaling the logo. Also removes the larger ads and fixes the background in place to prevent flickering when smooth scrolling.

BRAND NEW: Firefox 3.5's new clip-path rule makes the cut-off corners *really* cut-off. No more misalignment with the main background!

Update August 20 2009: removed line breaks from site logo Base64, which had begun to cause problems.
