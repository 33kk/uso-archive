### Description
Reddit Blue is an experimental style intended on adding a bit more color to the site. It's a work in progress and I will be making improvements over time...

IMPORTANT: Similar to a few other Reddit styles, this one will only work if you have disabled custom CSS. To do so, log in, go to preferences and un-tick the checkbox "allow reddits to show me custom styles." You will need to do this or some subreddits will appear broken.
