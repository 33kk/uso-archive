### Description
The website is helpful to show values/status of your Target 401k.

In Firefox, on the Your Portfolio Performance page (under the Manage Your Investments section), the website's formatting causes the GAINS column to be covered with a block of links.  The changes this style makes affect the size and position of display areas of the web page.  Print preview shows that the block of links displayed along the right is cut off, but that all of the 401k fund data will be printable.  

Although it was written to fix one specific page at resources.hewitt.com, it will affect the entire site due to the broad domain. 

As of March 28, 2008, this style does not seem to be necessary for Target 401k but I will leave it available as a learning tool?
