### Description
Milk fox - gray logo over white background in the about:blank page.

After seeing Blue Firefox http://userstyles.org/styles/1761 and liking it a lot, got a bit too much blue every time I opened a tab.

So I created a lighter, softer version, based in that code.

Image is base64 encoded so no links to external websites. Enjoy.
