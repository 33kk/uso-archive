### Description
Mastodon Flat CSS (MFC) is a flat CSS theme for Mastodon, with varying palette options. Midnight Blue is similar to Twitter's Dark Mode. Clean Slate is a light theme with dark headers. More palette options are available, including your own custom colors and font!

### Update notes
https://github.com/trwnh/mastodon-flat-css
Formerly known as "Mastodon Midnight Blue", but refactored to include variable color palettes.

This theme applies a few colors, but leaves the class names somewhat ungrouped so that you can experiment for yourself if you wish to modify this theme with your own color choices. This theme also removes borders for a flat look, as well as replaces the font on most text elements. Finally, it forces the full display name and account handle to be shown, and on separate lines.

Feel free to contact or follow me on Mastodon if you wish: <a href="http://mastodon.social/@trwnh">@trwnh@mastodon.social</a>

<b>Make sure to set the domain for this style to apply to your Mastodon instance's URL!</b> You can also set a preferred font. To choose your own colors, make sure to select "Custom" for your palette first!

Last updated for Mastodon v2.7.1
Many fixes! Still haven't touched the profile directory at all, but the web app should be brought up to standard.

// Previously:
Complete rewrite to allow mixed-luminosity palettes! Now you can have a dark background and a light column, or vice-versa :) although some regressions may have found their way in -- please report any weird issues that you find to me if possible! However, please note that I haven't yet tested the theme with mobile or tablet layouts -- that update will come soon!
