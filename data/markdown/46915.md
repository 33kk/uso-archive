### Description
For Firefox 14+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds. 

This style fixes some appearance compatibility problems and fixes some known bugs on Firefox 6+ or newer for "LeftSideStar 1.3.1 " extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/leftsidestar/ , since the new Urlbar Identity block design landed due to Bug 634065.

If you want to use [Ext] LeftSideStar and have the Identity Box look more similar to Firefox 5 use:
style 49786

Tested on Firefox 14+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora and Nightly builds.
