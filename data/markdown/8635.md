### Description
Displays a Spinning Animated Firefox Logo (Spinfox) when loading a page in Firefox 3 (About:Blank)

Both the Loading New Tab AND the About:blank's background image will be animated.  When you open a new tab, it will display this animated image until something from that site is able to be displayed.  

* Loosely based on user 1744's style 1761 , and My style 6488 code... Thanks!

Features:
+ Appears when opening new tabs
+ Appears when loading new tabs content
+ Appears within loading page contents (a loading div control containing a frame of another site)
+ Appears when a page transitions to external or new domain
+ Works in Firefox 3!
+ Clean and very appropriate animated default image, included with style (Firefox logo Spinning)
+ Makes your browser look great, and adds that "wow" factor.

Additional Information:
*NOTE: Please Clear your Cache and Restart your browser after installing or changing this style, your custom image will need to be cached in order for it to be displayed.

* You may have to disable the following two styles for this to work:
- Custom About:Blank logo
- Custom New Tab Loading Image

About:Spinner:
- The reason I do not use an Encoder is because I already tried to use an encoder, and it MAXES out the Max-Character size for Userstyles.org.
- The only solution would be to locally link it to your own hard drive....
- I can encode it properly locally, but cannot share the encoded style on userstyles without it kicking me out!
- Any further suggestions are appreciated
+ This style does still work great

Changelog:
- Initial Release
