### Description
Wanted to do something easier on the eyes. Hope people like it. Made specially thinking in Wrongplanet.net, to read it at night :)

Dark theme that works fairly well in many websites, browsed Lifehacker, Google, Gmail, Hotmail, Myspace, etc, looks fine :)

Hotmail now looks fine
