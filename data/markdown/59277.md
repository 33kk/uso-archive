### Description
Tired of never seeing your desktop background because your browser is always open and maximized? Try this. 

Based on "Discreet Transparency" by Satoz and "About:Blank Glass" by foxxyn8, which I combined and built upon to create a minimalistic style close to the classic Firefox, but totally transparent, in the spirit of Windows 7 Aero.

If you installed this style, please take the time to review it and leave your feedback.
