### Description
This is, in my opinion, the perfect interface; I hope some of you may enjoy it too! You'll save space in your window without having to use a weird 'all-in-one' button. This puts the tabs and the menubar all on the same line! It also replaces the menu items with easy-to-understand capital letters representing each item. I call this my FEVH bar now, because it says FEVHBTH instead of File, Edit, View..

### Update notes
NOTES: 
You must have the menubar disabled for this work; if you don't you'll have your minimize/restore/close buttons intersecting with your tabs.
It has only been tested on the newest build of Firefox Nightly on Windows 7. It should work on other builds/OSs however.
This requires Tabs on Top to be enabled or it will just complicate things.

CREDIT:
The code that replaces the text with these icons I owe to style 40211 by user 6717. I modified it heavily and basically chopped out the bits just relevant to replacing my menu items with icons.

The icons I made in Photoshop, and they went through many, many, many revisions before I could make them match the rest of the UI perfectly. They should (hopefully) fit the default Firefox UI without any problems at all. If you want to change them, it should be no problem at all. Just replace the URI in my code after each menu item name with your own URIs.

UPDATES:
Update Apr-5-2015: Addressed a small bug where the title bar would push the tabs and menu down a couple pixels when the window was not maximised. Also fixed a visual bug when using Persona themes.

Update Mar-9-2015: Finally back on this with some updates to make this style function once again! I no longer need to push content into the title bar since it can be simply disabled. As a result, I recommend disabling the titlebar. It still works if you don't, and still looks thinner and nicer in my opinion.

Update Jan-15-2011: fixed a bug with addon buttons in the tabbar, changed the code so that it all spreads back out when customizing. Made the last two options more comprehensible. 
I added the option to change transparency behind the menubar, and a choice of many different colours with hex for each one. Copy and paste the hex code into the second table here to see the colour: http://www.colourchart.net/
