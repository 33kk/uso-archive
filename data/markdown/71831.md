<b>Current Version 0.2.7.1</b>

<b>12/22/2013 - Version 0.2.7.1</b>
    - Requested: I added "http://194.71.107.164/" as a supported Domain for namazso and those of you who use the IP address instead of the ever changing domains

<b>12/12/2013 - Version 0.2.7</b>
    - Only torrent titles in the torrent lists will now change color when clicked on. 

I've added the option to change the color of the links you've clicked on. The default is the color I use, but if you would like to change it you may. If you would like me to make other colors changeable through this page, feel free to post in the discussions. I will try to respond as soon as I can.

    - Domain update (the style now applies to .gl, .se, and .is)

4/14/2013 - Version 0.2.6
    - Domain update (Due to the back and forth change from .se to .gl, the style will simply affect either domain from now on. If there are more domain changes in the future, be sure to check back here as I will attempt to always keep this updated.)
    - The icons broken by the domain change have been fixed

4/9/2013 - Version 0.2.5
    - Domain update (.se to .gl)
    - Ad blocking update

1/1/2013 - Version 0.2.4
    - Ad blocking update
    - Replaced "The Promo Bay" image (I'm all for TPB promoting content made by its users', but there isn't an easy way to make it match the style when its constantly changing)
    - Changed "visited" link color. The visited links are darker and are only applied to links in the search results list. 
    - Re-added the border to the search results list for better readability 

11/12/2012 - Version 0.2.3
    - Ad blocking update

    - Minor color updates

10/3/2012 - Version 0.2.1
    - Updated blog posts page
    - Replaced "Get Torrent File" green icon with grayscale version
    - Searched for more Ads to block (didn't find any)

9/3/2012 - Version 0.2.0
    - Replaced all known icons, not including skulls, with gray/dark background friendly versions
    - Fixed RSS logo at the top of VIP user pages

    - Increased overall quality of the logos
    - Updated screenshots to reflect recent changes

8/30/2012 - Version 0.1.3
    - Updated the style for the 404 error page

8/29/2012 - Version 0.1.2
    - Darkened lists to better match the style
    - RSS links list updated to match the style
    - Did a quick ad check and removed the ads that were being displayed to me (there is a possibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotargeting" target="_blank">location specific</a> advertising which will prevent me from hiding ads displayed to specific areas)
/*Note: CSS only has the capability to hide ads. It cannot prevent the downloading of the content within the ads such as images. This still uses up your bandwidth and allows ad companies to track you.

8/28/2012 - Version 0.1.1
    - File list box made readable
    - Small comment area updates for better readability
    - Comment box color and size
/*Note: There are still small transparent images put on most pages used by ad services for tracking. When you load the page it tells your browser to go get a 1px by 1px image off the ad server. They use this to track who is accessing the page with their ads on it and when. I seriously recommend you use some kind of ad blocking extension such as Adblock Plus.

8/27/2012 - Version 0.1.0
    - Release
