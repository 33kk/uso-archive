### Description
Reskins www.steamgifts.com and makes everything on the site darker, which makes it easier on the eyes at night (or in a dark room).  This was done solely by myself (Ix), but you may use this as a means of creating your own skins for the Steamgifts site.  If you do, I would appreciate credit, but I don't really care either way.  On a note it's a bit messy, not necessarily optimized; I may end up optimizing it later, but for now it works quite well.

Keep in mind that I fix and update skins based on when I notice that they might need updating, or something is wrong.  However, I don't always upload the results immediately (and sometimes the results get lost entirely).  Please pardon my slowness in updates from time to time.
