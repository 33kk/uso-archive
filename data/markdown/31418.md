### Description
This freekick style was made from the scratch, but was inspired by the old version of style 9696 of user 13423.

Priorities for this style:
 - keep it green, like in the old freekick.org's design,
 - keep it eye-friendly,
 - keep the website's funcionality available for polish and english languages.

Main advantages:
 - matchreport coloring (viewing matches becomes a pleasure ;))
 - chosen colors won't tire your eyes
 - style is complete
 - style will be developed until I leave the game (impossible ;))
 - style looks nice (in my taste)


Changes:

[14.06.2010] updated tool tips
[29.06.2010] repaired every (I hope so) side effect of the website update.
[23.08.2010] updated Messages and Clubnews tabs a bit.
[27.08.2010] updated tactics page (lists in conditional orders and lineup header).
[27.09.2010] updated news page and trophies highlighting.
[02.12.2010] fixed colors in players table rows (alternate-even[-odd]).
