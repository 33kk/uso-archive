### Description
Got sick and tired of trying to make out dark videos against the bright, white background of youtube.com.  Bulk of this CSS is setting the style of the tabs.  The tabs are not gifs or jpegs but CSS.  A quick glance at my code reveals that I'm a noobie so a lot could be optimized.  But, hey, I did the work so nyah!  Enjoy!

Updated 11/28/2006 - youtube replaced some of the tab elements with repeating gif files.  I'll have to brush up on including gif data in css files.
