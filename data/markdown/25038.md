### Description
I, like many others, use multi-protocol IM clients like Digsby, and don't need Facebook Chat integrated on the site itself. Hiding the original Facebook chat bar posed the issue of losing your notifications as well, but since the update this has been moved elsewhere. You can now safely remove the Facebook Chatbar with this very simple userstyle.
