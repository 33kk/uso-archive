### Description
This style is based on style 1226 by user 977. I removed the ugly backgrounds, and replaced the somewhat vague "globe" icon with a more visible green arrow icon.

I also fixed the positions of the icon and the menu, so they look better and fit nicely with the rest of the Gmail layout.

The green arrow, by the way, is the "go-next" icon from the Tango Icon Gallery.

-------
Update [11.09.06]: For some reason I gave the credit of the original style to the wrong user. Sorry about that, user 977.
I made the domain change a while ago, but I guess I neglected to update the online version afterwards. Thanks for writing me about your version, user 977, for I would have never remembered to look at my code again. :D
