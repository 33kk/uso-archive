### Description
I've had this style for about a year and thought I'd share it with everyone else. This removes every single ad found on QJ.net while keeping the bare navigation intact. It's all in one single column showing only the news with a few tweaks on the design aspect. It's very minimalistic and should pave a way to view the site in a tolerable manner. 

I've also made something similar for Joystiq.
