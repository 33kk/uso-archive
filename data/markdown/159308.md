### Description
Looking for the 2011 design version? You can find it here: https://userstyles.org/styles/159755/the-return-of-old-gmail-2011-design

<b>Note: Before you install the userstyle, make sure the main sidebar with compose, inbox folders etc is expanded, inbox tabs are off, make sure your display density is set to Compact and in Settings > General, make sure Button Labels is set to text or the script won't work properly.

Also, if you just want the old logo, use this script: https://userstyles.org/styles/159153/old-gmail-logo.
</b>

Margins have been fixed in basic HTML UI, and some button icons/resources are now in the 2011 era again.

243 lines of css is all it takes to change it back to HOW IT SHOULD BE.
Enjoy! This destroys the new 2018 Gmail UI and changes it back to the 2010-2011 era. Also works a bit on the legacy 2011 UI, and changes the logo back on Basic HTML.
