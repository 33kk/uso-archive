### Description
Retextures, resizes & positions Firefox menu & Customize page elements for better use of space

### Update notes
<i>Not compatible with Firefox 57+ aka 'Quantum' aka 'WebExtensions Apocalypse'. This' an 'Australis' theme compatible with Firefox ESR 52+ (for another year), and the new fork "Basilisk" created and maintained by the team behind Pale Moon (which has been well maintained for years) & see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfox/comments/6rgo90/will_waterfox_support_legacy_addons_after_firefox/">here</a> about Waterfox compatibility. Also recommend <a href="https://github.com/JustOff/ca-archive">Classic Add-ons Archive</a> for all pre-WebExtensions builds of Firefox.</i>


• to further refine width of boxes if preferred see 'finetune box width' line 105 ota
• with box icon size 1 means 100%, the main screenshot shows icons set to .75 for example
• with the themes popup, setting a heights more relevant with low res screens - ie consider <code>500px</code>
• some of the buttons at the bottom of the customize tab screenshot are from Classic Theme Restorer addon
• btw changed the 'Exit' label to 'OK' after doing the screenshot
•• for technical reasons, the darker grey background on the customize page only shows after setting a custom lightweight theme for the navbar, opposed to the 'default' transparent/blue; see the custom presets in the themes popup on the customize page, or browser from there at addons.mozilla to install one

Updated 18 April 2017: 
• changed abit of customize tab code to get working again
• changed texture pattern to data URI cause dead img server, better local anyway
• changed settings labels to clear up confusion
