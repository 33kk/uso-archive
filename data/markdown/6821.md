### Description
Cleans up the xkcd.com forums for users of the Prosilver theme, reducing it to a rather minimalist view that still contains everything necessary for easy viewing, navigation, and posting.  Also removes the annoying scrollbars from overly-long codeboxes and posts, allowing them to stretch as far as they need to.

The colorcoded line on the side tells you the status of the forum/thread.  Lightblue and red are for read/unread threads you have *not* posted in and forums, while blue and darkred are for read/unread threads you *have* posted in.

Announcement threads are killed by this theme, but they can still be viewed by hitting up your User Control Panel.  Sticky threads are also killed, but can be unkilled by removing the ".sticky" from the first part.  If you do so, they then show up with a darkgreen line.

Usable as of May 2008.  Future updates to the Prosilver theme may break portions of this, of course.
