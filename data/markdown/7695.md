### Description
The Google iPhone pages make great sidebars in Firefox, but they need to be tweaked to match the screen-size, and provide correct mouse cursor feedback. This script works with the Gmail iPhone interface <http://mail.google.com/mail/x/> and the Google iPhone Reader interface <http://www.google.com/reader/i/>.  

To get them to work, you need to go to Bookmarks --> Organize Bookmarks... and right-click where you would like the new bookmark (the Bookmark toolbar folder is a good choice) and select New Bookmark...

Put the above address in the Location field, and give it a name.  Make sure that the Load this bookmark in the sidebar box is checked.
