### Description
Makes the dark theme darker.  Also removes badge icons and slightly reduces the size of timestamps.

First you need to enable twitch's dark theme then use frankerfacez along side it.  This style makes the main elements all black.  Also changes the font to Roboto 17px to improve readability.
