### Description
Wikipedia makes hella load of money - in October 2014, Wikimedia (owners of Wikipedia) announced to users that they had a $6 million surplus in funds. Just weeks later, they started posting fundraising banners again. I'm sick of these, I've stopped donating and now I've created this small code under cc-0 to hide Jimmy's banner. Think of it as a boycott.
