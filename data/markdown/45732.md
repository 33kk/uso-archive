### Description
<b>I have made a new setting - you can choose whether the top bar scrolls with the page. I have made "no" the default, because "yes" causes channel pages to auto-scroll to the wrong place on most channel page tabs. For Firefox, there is an option for "yes, except on channel pages"</b>

If you are a new user, I suggest you try the default settings first (just install).
 
If you don't like the options you chose and want to choose new ones, and you don't see the Update button, delete the style and re-install.

Formerly called YouTube Earth Hour (Dark Theme)

### Update notes
I appreciate all feedback and don't consider it a complaint if somebody has a suggestion. Because of the variety of settings, I don't personally see all the possible configurations, so I may not be seeing a problem that is obvious to you.

You can create a background color theme by using the options to set color levels and texture. If you use a custom background image you may want to set the scroll/fixed setting to one of the "fixed" options. The fixed/cover and fixed/stretch options will both fit the image to the window ("cover" will maintain image aspect ratio, "stretch" will match window's aspect ratio).

The "main sections color" setting will set the color of a highlighted section on the main pages (like search results on the search results page or the main feed on the home page.) If you don't want it you can choose "0% (invisible)" for the main-sections-opacity setting.

If you want to edit things like link colors, or if you want to use the no-option version of the style (to get auto updates) and customize the options, without needing to re-edit after each update, use style 79953.

I use the <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/114002">YouTube Center</a> userscript which allows centering of the watch page and player as well as many other useful functions.

My custom scrollbars are based on style 51401 by user 169.
