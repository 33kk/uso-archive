### Description
People were complaining about the bright white new TV.com layout.
This changes it to dark brown. Makes the site easier to read, while you save the planet at the same time ;) .
(not extremely complete, but functional enough, see comments in CSS. )

Update 17 sept 08 : Changed some things.
Not complete yet, but better than the previous version.
Don't want to spend too much time on this since it seems like tv.com is changing the site as well...

Update 2 Oct 08 : Adjusted font size. Updated some colors. Judging by the "going dark" background on TV.com they are in the progress of adjusting things themselves as well.
