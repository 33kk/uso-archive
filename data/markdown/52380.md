### Description
Make Facebook use your browser's full window width.
Optionally offers these extras:

* Unobtrusive sidebar, slides-in on hover. [default: on]
* Hide the ego pane. [default: off]

Work in progress, expect frequent updates.

Note that the (automatically generated) screenshot doesn't really give an impression of what this style can do. Maybe I should hand-craft one...

BTW - It appears as if facebook has discontinued the sidebar altogether :-( At least that's how it appears to me as of today (2011-08-25) - I cannot find much news on the matter yet though.
