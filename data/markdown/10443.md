### Description
This style does two things to improve the way the BetterSearch extension renders on Google search results:

1)  Removes redundant BetterSearch thumbnails, for when BetterSearch adds a thumbnail preview to a result for which Google already shows a thumbnail of that video (i.e., YouTube, Google Video, Break, DailyMotion, etc).  I hope that makes sense - if not, it should if/when you see one of these search results.

2)  Resizes the Google generated thumbnail for 1) music specific results, and 2) video specific results (i.e., same results as #1, above).

If you find you like this style, you may also want to see two of my other styles, style 2536 and style 2534 .
