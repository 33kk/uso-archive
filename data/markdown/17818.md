### Description
This style simulates the Stop, Reload, and Loading button for Safari 4 which is put into location bar.

REQUIRES:
1. userChromeJS extention @ http://userchromejs.mozdev.org/ + Sub-Script/XUL Loader (for easier installation)
2. Stop-Reload-Safari4.uc.js script @ http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/428065/Stop-Reload-Safari4.uc.js

NOTE:
You need to put Stop button to left of the Reload button for this to work (well, it seems that this is NOT necessary since script do that already).
In case Stop/Reload button disappears, try to ADD THEM AGAIN in customize menu and restart Firefox.

For EVEN MORE Safari 4 look:
style 19500 (alternative to this style)
style 18000
style 18681

This style is inspired/taken from style 2131 by user 875, style 8249 by user 4639, and style 518 by user 12.  Thanks!
