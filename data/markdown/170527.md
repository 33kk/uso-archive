### Description
<b><a href="https://github.com/bradtchapman/jamf-pro-dark-mode">GitHub Source</a></b>

Now that MacOS has a native dark mode, I think Jamf deserves one, too!

I have spent 20+ hours combing through page after page of the Jamf Pro console and adjusting the colors to create a general 'dark mode' theme.  My changes affect the text weight and colors, backgrounds, the dashboard, lists, tables, sidebars, policies, inventory, assistants, dialog boxes, buttons, checkboxes, search bars, alerts, and for multiple event states (normal, disabled, hover, focus, active).  There is a mild contrast improvement.

Feel free to submit additional changes to the source code on GitHub.  Please leave a comment so I know why you've edited that particular section.

This is my first attempt at anything approaching "web front-end" anything in over 15 years, so please be kind.
