### Description
<strong>Hey! 👋🏽</strong>

RainbowTube++ is a simple rainbow effect on any statically red elements in YouTube user interface which also comes with a 🌈 <strong>Nyan Cat progress bar</strong>, a 🖱 <strong>hover effect</strong> and a <strong>"WATCHED" overlay</strong> all of which can be disabled.

This style works well with other styles such as <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/148466/flattube">Flattube</a> and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/157126/cleantube-for-youtube-2018">CleanTube</a>

Feel free to tell me what you think and suggest more elements that should be "Rainbowified".
This style shouldn't interfere with many other styles.

If you aren't about the animated life, you can also try <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/167533/youtube-custom-color">Youtube Custom Color++</a> without sacrificing any of the setting presented on this style!
