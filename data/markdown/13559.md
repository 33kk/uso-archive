### Description
The comment moderation system at Joystiq is rather annoying, making it hard to read low rated comments. This removes the fading and coloring done to those comments, making it easier to read.

Update 20090107:

Added other, related sites. Now includes dsfanboy, nintendowiifanboy, ps3fanboy, xbox360fanboy and engadget
