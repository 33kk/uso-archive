screenshot

The Bauhaus ( #96 on the list ) font is here ( http://www.typenow.net/b.htm )  and 
Here is a address to a video on how to add new fonts ( http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1504726/add_new_font_in_seconds/  )

I would like to thank KrystalEmpire  and  Kupfel
Hopefully they don't mind me combining their codes ( Mininova - Darker 'n Simpler + mininova.org - dark grey redesign ) with some of my own work.
These 2 styles were created through them and If you like and install these styles please post a review thanking them also.
It's not too much too ask for all the hard work and time 


Anyway these 2 styles together change:

*  Layout 
*  Font size and style ( Bauhaus ) 
*  Remove flashing toolbar ad and most borders on all elements
*  Rounded rss , category header, and tab buttons
*  and more 

I originally made this because sometimes my eyes find it quite irritating staring at a white screen.
Made to my liking but open to any requests or changes desired
Constructive criticism is also very welcome.

Feel free to change or alter in any way  !!! Style has no Boundaries !!!
Enjoy and happy torrenting

P.S. - To increase the font size of torrent names just change the " font-size " values of these to elements
