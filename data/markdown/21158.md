### Description
Makes the buttons, and some borders, rounded in the MMORPG Urban Dead (http://urbandead.com). 
Looks much better than the game's default rectangular buttons.

I didn't modify the background colors, so maybe that will come in another style.

UPDATE:
 . . . 4-26-10: added Google Chrome / Stylist support.
 . . . 5-30-10: tried rearranging the code; added curved corners to more element classes.
 . . . 6-24-10: added a couple domains, so UDWitness and DumbWit screenshots will look more like UD.
 . . . 7-19-10: Ditto with IWitness, now that it's back online.
 . . . 9-03-10: Added the new safehouse status box (under the map).
 . . .10-23-10: Updated -webkit-border-radius to border-radius.
