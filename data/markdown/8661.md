### Description
Removes the Site Identity Favicon if the site does not supply one.

Gives you less distractions and guessing with Firefox 3's default favicon for sites that do not provide one.

Features:
+ Web site favicon will show up for sites that HAVE favicons
+ No favicon will display (Empty) on sites that do NOT have favicons

The Site Identity Button icon displays the Favicon of the current site, and when clicked, it brings up Firefox's new Passport Information.  This gives you advanced information about a website, and if any security breaches are occuring.

Examples:
A site such as Google has a favicon (the 'G' will display in the URLBar)
A site such as w3.org does not have a fav-icon (nothing will display in the AwesomeBar)

Integrates with Style 8664.
** Not to be used in conjunction with Style 8026 **

Additional Information:
This style works only on the new Firefox 3 browser.


Future Releases:
+ I Plan to release an update for this style that will hide the Site Identity button entirely, if a favicon is not provided (if site security information is not provided)
* Please do not release these two future release ideas without my permission, as I am likely to release them in a couple days.
** Currently working on a bug where the default favicon displays BEHIND the site favicon on sites that Provide a favicon.  **

Changelog:
1.0.0.2:
+ Added code to Show a default Favicon when you Hover over the Site Identity Button - For a site that does not provide one.

1.0.0.1:
+ Added code to now support Chrome, Local - File:// protocols, FTP...
+ Works on all sites now.
With Userstyles being down for practically a week, I have a huge list of new styles, and updates!!!
