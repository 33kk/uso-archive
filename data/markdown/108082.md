### Description
This style makes the dashboard entirely transparent, for those who want to apply a background to that part of the website and further make transparent the dashboard interface and avatar store.

This style also works at the communities section accessible within the plug.dj menu, so you can see whatever's playing as you browse. This also completes the avatar store by making its cells transparent.
