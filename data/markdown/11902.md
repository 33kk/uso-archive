### Description
Delicious (del.icio.us) site navigation menus (Bookmarks, People, Tags, Search....) will be transparent.

This style improves page visibility, allowing you to see all the web content behind the transparency.

* Thanks to user 1386 for the style 10306, upon which I got the idea for this style!


Features:
+ Bookmarks, People, Tags, Search, Options, ListOptions will be transparent.
+ Menus will become more opaque when they are hovered over with the mouse cursor
+ You will be able to see images and text behind the header menu (see thru) until hovered over

Works on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3

Integrates with the following Styles:
+ Style 11529
+ Style 11998

delicious.com nav menus are also known as subnav lists, and consist of UL (unordered list) code segments
Edit the Transparency (-moz-opacity) to your liking.  Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible translucent the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!

Changelog:
1.0.0.1
+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.
