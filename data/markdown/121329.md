### Description
Changes parts of youtube to make it flatter and cleaner looking.
It is less cluttered, and a lot of unnecessary lines and background tints have been removed.

### Update notes

<strong>--------------------------</strong>

• This style won't be getting updates for a while now since youtube brought out their own clean updated and dark theme. You can enable it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">youtube.com/new</a>. When they roll out this feature to everybody by default I might update this style for the new look.
