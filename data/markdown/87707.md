### Description
This style makes the private browsing mode more conspicuous.
It paints the background color of the browser window violet if you are in private browsing mode.
It's like the incognito mode in Google Chrome.

Also, it is completely Personas and "Private Tab"-Addon compatible!
Have fun :)

(Oh, and sorry for this inscrutable CSS Code, because I'm an CSS-Newbie :D)
