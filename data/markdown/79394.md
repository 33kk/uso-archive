### Description
Highlights focused link (url) - the one which has (usually, in most cases) thin dotted border when navigating by TAB-key. Also the link is highlighted when right-clicked and when left-clicked while holding down the left mouse buttom.
Background color is yellow, foreground color is black and there is 2px green border, so it should work on both on dark and light pages.
