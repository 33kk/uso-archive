### Description
A fork of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/108169/archlinux-and-archassault-dark">prurigro</a>'s Archlinux userstyles, which haven't been updated since 2015. 

I made a few changes to the Wiki since he stopped updating, so I thought that I might upload what I've been using for myself. I might add support for more Arch-related websites later, but right now I'm focusing on the wiki.
