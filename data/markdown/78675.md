### Description
Note: No longer updated; I don't have the time (no matter how small) nor interest to continue maintaining the userstyle, but it works for most subreddits in its current state.

Some subreddits find it necessary to remove downvote arrows, ruining the spirit of reddit and hindering the community's involvement in the promotion/demotion of content.  Take back control.

Bonus: This UserStyle also forces the 'report' button and upvote arrows to always be visible.

----------

<b>Found a subreddit without downvote arrows?</b>
This code should cover every subreddit possible; however, if you happen to find a sneaky subreddit that managed to find a way around it feel free to contact me (see below) with the subreddit so I can make code additions/adjustments.

Leave feedback in the <i>Discussions</i> or PM me on reddit (<a href="http://reddit.com/user/zants">zants</a>) if you have any tips or helpful suggestions. :)
