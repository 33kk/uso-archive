### Description
Transform Google Docs into a Mac OS X Leopard app. The buttons are modeled after the leopard Finder toolbar buttons, as are the toolbars. All menus and contextual (right-click) menus are themed to look like the native Mac OS X menus. This theme also styles Google Docs' DHTML windows to match the actual window chrome from OS X, adding shadows, status bars, lighting and cursor modifications to complete the effect - the two types of windows should look identical after enabling this theme.

This is what the main Google Docs UI looks like with this theme:
