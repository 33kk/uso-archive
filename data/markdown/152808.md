### Description
Some elements on wikipedia have embedded style information in HTML.<br/>
This often makes them hard to read while using dark themes, but forcing them to be dark can result in lost information (for example: green and red table cells in some tables).<br/>
Use this style as a toggle for dark table cells.<br/>
This style is meant to be used with <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/151782/wikipedia-1911-dark-improved">Wikipedia 1911 dark improved</a>, but should work with any dark theme.
