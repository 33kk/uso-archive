### Description
I admit this one is a little silly. After all, unless you share the style with your players, you're the only one who will see it. But if you find the default styles of Roll20 a little... pedestrian, this style will turn them into a close approximation of an official book. I haven't really done a lot of work on this, and for all I know it restyles something else important. But hey, here it is.
