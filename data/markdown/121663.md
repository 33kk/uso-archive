### Description
Postimage.org Free Image File Host restyle - Black Background with Lime and Cyan text links (Red Links when hovered).<br><br>This restyle pushes the top down to help center the user interface (on logged-out homepage and uploading pages only), and recolors the elements. Removed "Add to Favorites" bookmark link and all footer links. To compensate for the pitifully small user interface, user is advised to zoom magnify the page with their browser controls, as shown in screenshot (133% or 150% minimum suggested; whatever user prefers) - your browser will remember this site-specific zoom scaling. Alternate screenshot, linked under the main "style enabled" screenshot, shows Postimage.org unmodified (with the style disabled). A mini tutorial on the excellent Postimage file host service, from a satisfied user, is at the bottom of the NOTES section.
