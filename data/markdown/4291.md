### Description
Applies to <something>.mail.yahoo.com</something>/ (url-prefix). Will create a less busy and cluttered page with the glaring white background softened down to a mellow green shade. Still a work-in-progress.

The appearance of other users' screens may differ from the screenshots shown because the author also has a specific non-default Yahoo! color theme selected ("Red/Olive"). This server-side option can be chosen by any Yahoo! Mail Classic user.

Note that manual editing of the url-prefix strings may be needed to allow this Style to apply to your own Yahoo! WebMail-Classic server address.
