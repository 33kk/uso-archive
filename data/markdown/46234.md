### Description
A dark style for the Firefox 4 Read It Later extension sidebar (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/read-it-later/). Loosely created to match the style of foxxyn8's Firefox 4 About:Addons Flat and Dark (http://userstyles.org/styles/37044/firefox-4-about-addons-flat-and-dark).

A quick note, I use the All in one Sidebar extension, and this is made for that purpose. I am not sure how it works in other sidebars. It should be fine but let me know if it isn't. I will try and fix whatever is wrong (give me screenshots).
