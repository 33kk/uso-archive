### Description
yahoo removed the dark skin of their fantasy sports site. 
that was lame. my dark global style didn't work so good- a screen refresh when scrolling (not reload) that annoyed me to fix in a better way.

i am still working on it, but it now makes yahoo usable for me (i only use yahoo fantasy baseball so other fantasy sports may not work as i have not tested on any of the others.
