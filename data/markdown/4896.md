### Description
A fast hack I did a yr or 2 ago to changed the style to be a black background for the main screen and the search screen.  I'm of the style school that feels big bright white backgrounds are harder to read. Maybe somebody else in the SE WI will enjoy using it... Not really plan on making any adjustments but if you have a suggestions..
