### Description
So this is a more sleek dark red theme for MAL. The bulk of this code was made by my boy <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/377182">RaitaroH</a>. Without him I would have struggled to make it look as good as it is. I modified, removed and added a few things to the original code. What I changed was the colors, got rid of some of that wasted space on the side by narrowing the margins (should cover roughly 75% of the screen no matter the monitor (however you will not notice a difference if u have a 720p screen)), and changed the logo. See Additional Info for how to mod things and to get rid of some of the additions I added to the code.

### Update notes
If you wish to get rid of the margin mod then follow these steps:
1. install the style
2. head over to MAL and click on the extension that you use to use these styles
3. click the pencil or the edit button for the code
4. scroll down to line 1977
5. then delete lines 1977-1996

You can also change the margin width as well by following these steps:
1. install the style
2. head over to MAL and click on the extension that you use to use these styles
3. click the pencil or the edit button for the code
4. scroll down to line 1995
5. change the % value
