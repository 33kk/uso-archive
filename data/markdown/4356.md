### Description
I no longer use this theme preferring NASA Night Launch  at:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4908


However for those who would prefer to use Dark Sidebars with MidnightFox  (Version 0.65 and 0.71), in a Windows environment, this fix might prove useful.

With this fix all sidebars and the Manage Styles window should now be white text on a black background, hopefully resolving any previous black on black issues.    

I would recommend strongly that anyone downloading this fix should also
download either one of:

http://userstyles.org/styles/245 
http://www.userstyles.org/styles/983

If this is not done, it may no longer be possible to see, in the Stylish Manage Styles Window, which files are enabled (or not), as the background there will  now be black.

  
                 The images below were made using Version 0.71
