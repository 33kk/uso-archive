### Description
A clean modern messenger with partially transparent backing and a picture in the background with a little bit of shadow behind the messages to make them pop off the background a little as I couldnâ€™t find how to blur the background image on the fly in css for this site.
This is built upon the "Dark/Night Facebook Messenger" by cicerakes.

### Update notes
Probably won't be updating this too often but feel free to edit the css and update a better version yourself.

- fixed pols text
  fixed black text where unreadable
  fixed svg backgrounds to see the black svg on white circle

- Background image scaling added by Kirk Clemons
