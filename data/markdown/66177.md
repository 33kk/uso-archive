works only with "use small icons" selected from customize menu.

- reduces tabs, bookmarks toolbar and navigation toolbar height,
- disables favicon on searchbar,
- reduces statusbar(Add-on bar) height as well as icon sizes for stylish, greasemonkey, scriptish etc.. on it,
- replaces ugly green scriptish button with userscripts button. taken from -> http://userstyles.org/styles/53817/scriptish-use-userscripts-org-icon-everywhere

most parts of this style are taken from various styles that already available here on userstyles. I edited a bit and added some. thanks to the original authors of the styles that included in this style.

UPDATE: Statusbar (Add-on Bar) redesigned. lighter background, text-shadow (for status4evar) added, sleeker look etc.
