### Description
A FurAffinity style by Cooped.  

Updated on 2014.08.12.

My personal style for FurAffinity.  A black theme with soft text and subtle contrasts.  I've also cleaned up several areas of FurAffinity that either cluttered quickly or introduced inconsistencies.

Black Slime is a base style for many other themes which share common functionalities such as:  Dynamic Updating, a News Delivery System, Dissolving Links, and much much more.
