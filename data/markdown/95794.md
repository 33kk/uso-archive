### Description
In December 2013, the new black <I>StackExchange™ MultiCollider SuperDropdown™</I> (the bar on top) was rolled out. Many of us felt the black too distracting, and other things missing. I've collected some ideas from <a href='http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/210041/192154'>Gallery of custom styles and/or scripts for the top-bar</a> and decided to publish it here as UserScript to share.
