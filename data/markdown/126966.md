### Description
Keep it clean!
Keep it simple!
Keep it dark!

... and let the users customize a bit if they want to ;)

### Update notes
- Everything should be themed, regardless if you use the free or paid version of Google Play Music
- Everything means even context menus and less frequently visited pages
- In addition to vanilla style, it gives the user more decent button feedbacks (hover effects), which makes it easier to navigate when you are sitting on a couch in front of your tv! (maybe how google should have done it?) 
- Sidebar customizations - hide unwanted buttons
- Color customizations - choose your preferred accent color
- I am an active user of Google Play Music and try to maintain this theme as fast as possible
- Mainly tested with Firefox
- Chrome/Opera should work as good as Firefox - will always keep an eye on it
- Every single line of code should be documented to make it easier for you to customize if you are only a little bit familiar with css

... tell me if you find a bug or something not themed!
