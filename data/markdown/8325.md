### Description
I'm sure like me you love your GMail account, but doesn't it come with a lot of extra bumf that just gets in the way.. Cluttering up the screen and detracting from the important business of viewing and replying to your emails.. So here is my own personal attempt at clearing things up a little, I've adapted bits from here and twiddled with bits from there as I've learnt the delicate art of re-styling a page to me own tastes..

I hope someone else might like this too, I'll try to keep things updated as GMail fiddles and I'm also open to suggestions for how this can be improved..

Also as an added bonus I've tried to keep the code clean and have documented what each bit does so you should be able to adapt this to your own needs with ease (hopefully) but I'm on hand should you need some help you only haveto ask :)
