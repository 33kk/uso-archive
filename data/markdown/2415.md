### Description
If you're like me, you cannot stand the default font family and sizes displayed on the website or the size / font of the buttons and form fields. To me, they're just too large and I prefer a smaller (though still visible) more "organized" look. I was quite annoyed when they enlarged all the drop-down menu's, text field's and button's fonts.

This changes the entire site's (including petpages, user lookups, guilds, shops, etc.) to Tahoma 8pt.
It can easily be turned on/off, but since this just edits font, it shouldn't be a problem.

If there's anything I've missed or you feel should be added, let me know. ^^
