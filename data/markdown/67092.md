### Description
A simple script to alter the colours of backgrounds and text in GMail message listings.  It can also colour the backgrounds of alternating messages in Conversation View, to help distinguish between messages.

Select the colours you would like to use from the colour pickers below, and then install the style into Stylish. The default green colours work well with existing GMail themes like Tea House.

### Update notes
Updated 18 June 2012.

This is work-in-progress, and more features may be added.

My thanks are due to all the userstyle coders here who have helped me get my head around CSS and create this simple little style. In particular, thanks are due to bookdragoness for Marina Resurrected, and C26000 for the Real GMail Turf Theme.
