### Description
When switching your wrike theme, this uses the colors to call all the panels.
This theme works best on the themes with the dark colors as the text is a light #CCC

- fixed - Some of the color may be hard-coded to a purple hue, working on that. sorry
- gnatt charts are rendered on a canvas with javascript, not sure where to get colors here, so an invert and opacity change
- 7/25/19 - updated more nested menus, and more areas i found i missed. seems a new style went in to place so touched that up to.
-01/02/20 - fixed some inverted colors and a few missing panels.
