### Description
Was unable to access the mobile version of the site so reading .md files on the site was a misery on my 9 inch HD tablet (either a tiny font or loads of moving the screen around)

Exclusively works on the view pages for .md files. Increases font size, switches font family to serif, makes the container fluid and includes a half assed restyling of the fluid header.  I've tried to make the regular expression as much of an edge case as possible.

Will upload a better jpeg to explain what it does if needed.
