### Description
This style reduces clutter and generally unnecessary content, particularly on the individual article or post pages. As I'm middle aged the font size of the individual article pages is significantly increased.

This style also assumes you are running an ad blocking extension for your browser. If you aren't, your results will no doubt be different.
