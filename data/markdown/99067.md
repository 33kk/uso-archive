### Description
<mark><b>Important: Click the "Show CSS Code" button first. The install button will work after that. I highly recommend this <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/">style</a> that makes the "Show CSS Code" button much easier to find.</b></mark> â€• <b>Forever Pinned Tabs</b> pins all tabs at once to give you more space and allow you to see which tabs you are working on without having to use the arrow to scroll to the sides when your toolbar is full for a much faster browsing experience.
