### Description
Makes the banner invisible and moves the rest of the content to the top of the page.

I've added a bunch of stuff to get rid of most of those ghastly purple gradients, and move some of the upper elements a little closer together vertically.

I've also written a greasemonkey script to add the login/logout buttons from the main banner to the toolbar, and you can get it here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/39633
