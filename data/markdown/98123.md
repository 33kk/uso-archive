### Description
This is my personal userstyle for the superb Clio practice management software (www.goclio.com), replacing the current design's emphasis on mustard yellow & negative space.  It is very much a work in progress and will only ever reflect my personal tastes and preferences, to wit, a focus on the content rather than the interface.  It does fix overdue task coloring and alternating row colors though this is of course dependent on Clio's willingness to retain the appropriate code.  While you are welcome to make suggestions, it will be updated according to my whim and is maintained here so I can install it on my own computers.

My first goal is cleaning up the code and enabling drop-down color options.
