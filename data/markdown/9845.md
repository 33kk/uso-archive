### Description
Removes all unnecessary elements from google. Gets rid of logos, rarely-used buttons and adverts. Also, now that firefox supports keyword searches from the address bar, there is no longer a need for search bars in web pages and so this has been removed also.

Additionally, the google style has been completely changed to make it more readable and power efficient. Thanks to user 667 for the code for the background gradient effect.

This style affects:
Google Search - complete redesign, no bugs
Google Image Search - complete redesign, no bugs
Google Shopping - buggy
Google Maps - No print support, other bugs
Google News - No archive support

This style currently affects only the .com versions of Google. Support for other countries is extremely unlikely to be added due to a lack of consistency in the id/classes between different google domains. The google homepage has been left completely untouched so access to google's more advanced features can be found from there.

If you have any bugs/requests please let me know in the comments.

There is now a thin version of this style intended for mobile phones, sidebars and widgets which can be found at style 9900.
