### Description
Faviconizes tabs the same way as here: http://kanttii.deviantart.com/art/Faviconize-Firefox-Tabs-155386558

When hovering a tab, it becomes wider and it's text will be visible as in the screenshot. Otherwise it shows only the favicon. Margin between tabs is also a bit wider for easier use.

I made a style for those who want it easily and doesn't like hassling with about:config.

Please report bugs!
