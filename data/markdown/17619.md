### Description
Originally based on this Style: http://userstyles.org/styles/10416

Modified to look (imho) much better (it didn't even look like in the screenshot for me).
Anyway, if you like it feel free to use it if not don't load it.

I marked the line where you can re-enable the tab-close button (for notebook users mainly). I'm also unsure about the smaller favicon line. Personally I find it better. Does anybody know howto remove the unnecessary space between tabs so they are grouped tighter together? Best would be something like as big as the title is, but max. 100px or so. I think that would look really neat. Please drop me a line if you know how.
