### Description
Makes About:Crashes display an image of your choice.  About Crashes can be accessed via the locationbar, and displays the calls home to Mozilla based on Bugs or crashes.  Another excellent way to implement a new UI feature for your favorite web browser.

Integrates with Style 7047, among all my other About: page modifications

Features:
- Appears on about:crashes
- Clean and very appropriate default image, included with style (Firefox logo - faded & shadowed)
- Fully customizable style, for your own enjoyment.

Additional Information:
*NOTE: Please Clear your Cache and Restart your browser after installing or changing this style, your custom image will need to be cached in order for it to be displayed.

Instructions:
In the CSS, change the website image I provided to the image you wish to display
You may also change the background HEX color to match your image.  The background color of text in this style has not been changed.
The images that work best as the background are .JPG and .PNG

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Added Code header.  For some reason it was not included!
= No functional changes to the code - not a required update.
