### Description
This is a very roughly tossed-together fix for the new Twitch beta chat functions, as a temporary solution to the issues that BTTV causes with the current non-updated version. This is designed to work in tandem with the DarkenTTV option enabled, however, and will not work or look good with the default setting.
