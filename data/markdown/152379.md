### Description
This style overwrites most usage of the light "Effra" font used on the new Literature & Latte website, with a particular focus on blog article body text, forum threads and form post listings. It will prefer Helvetica or Arial, finally falling back to whatever default sans font you use in your browser.

It also cleans up a few rough edges in formatting particularly around lists and quotes.
