### Description
YouTube's theater mode will now span almost the entire viewport!
You no longer need to go fullscreen to watch videos in high res.

It will also fix the top bar to the top of the page instead of having it always on screen.
You can optionally make the top bar appear only on hover, giving you even more space for the video.

Note:
The top bar in the screenshot is dark due to a style I use, which is not a part of this style.

### Update notes
I'd recommend that you test out all modes of handling the top bar and chose the one that fits you the most.
