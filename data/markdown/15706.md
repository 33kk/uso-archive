### Description
I modified 4chan improvement by hark


Things I changed:

The colors:
I used the colors from a small pallet that the google dev's made:
http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/visual-design

The layout:
I removed a LOT from the page :). I also moved the forms (for name/trip, email, comment etc) to the left, since I don't like centered websites :P. The comment boxes are all an X amount of em wide.

The rest:
I also replaced the font for Verdana.


If you want to change things in the style; I have documented it for a bit, for the rest, try google :)

I recommend using this theme in combination with Greasemonkey + the next script from userscripts.org (or google.com if you can't find them):

Linkifier plus --> Changes links that are text into clickable links

4chan expand images --> there will be a little + on the left of the opening post, click it, and all thumbnails will be replaced by the original images.

4chan 404 defeater --> a little script/addon (whichever you prefer) that creates a little box on the right of the screen (I modded mine to be on the lower left). If you click the F5, it will check if the thread has new content, if there is no new content (or if it has 404'd), it will not refresh so you can still check things out. (if a thread has 404'd it will tell you by showing a big red 404 on the left)

/b/ackwash --> hover over a >>******** link and a floating box of said comment will show! This way you don't have to click the links to see the comment :)

And remember: Google if your friend!
