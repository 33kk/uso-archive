### Description
* Cleaner and cool look and feel (FriendFeed is already clean, this makes it a lot cleaner)
* Different font style
* Highlights friends comments with baby yellow (instantly know that the user is already your friend)
* Highlights your comments with baby blue (it’s cool to see your own comments from river of comments. Looks good when you are a distance away your computer, makes your comment a marker in conversations)
* Highlights Likes to light pink
* Dims comments from non-friends (normal color of FriendFeed comment)
* Separated each posts with a bottom border

This userstyle brings the FriendFeed conversation to another level by instantly letting you know…

1) Your own comment (Powder Blue)
2) Your friends comments (Light Yellow)
3) Your non-friends comments (Normal FriendFeed Comment Color)
4) Likes (Light Pink)

As FriendFeed becomes popular, you’ll definitely need some kind of instant and attention grabbing color that catches your eyes and tell you where you left off in a conversation.

Hope you like it.
