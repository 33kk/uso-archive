### Description
This style is designed to make your URL and search bars transparent. The color of the transparent URL bar will change with your security level. Clear is normal, blue is secure, and red is unsecured.

Please note: 

- I am also using the all-glass Firefox mod discussed here: http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=746714
- The style doesn't look right with the search box and I'm not sure how to fix it. I never use the search box anyways, since search is incorporated into the Firefox location bar.
