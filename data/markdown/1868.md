### Description
hiveminder team is implementing the css in their site. changes are visible (minor bug with the hidden mode right now).
but soon all will be fixed and all of hiveminder's users will gain from this experiment. 
all and all - way to go hiveminder team! for listening to your users and for acting quickly as you did.  
jesse (for hiveminder, the comment down below) ... it feels pretty darn good ;)

*easily scan your tasks with vertical line (hidden mode and visible)
*task id almost invisible (opacity low - don't need your "screen attention" all the time)
*changed the size of the main box and scootched it to the left a bit. for better focus.
*added distance between checkboxed and text

your requests and suggestions are always welcome...
