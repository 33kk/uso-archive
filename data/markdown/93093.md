### Description
Web of Trust, better known as WOT is a crowdsourcing service designed to offer other people's experience with websites, so you can be better informed about where you go on the internet. While the WOT button is enough for most people, this style allows you to see the trustworthiness of a website simply by glancing at the active tab, or by seeing the address bar -- The border will change colors to also tell you the trustworthiness of a website.
