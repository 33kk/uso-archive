### Description
Modifies the colors, logos, and a few other images on YouTube. Valacar says he isn't going to be updating his version so I tweaked his to fit the newer version of YouTube that was put out on April Fool's Day 2010. It says "Dark Gray" but it was mostly black, might be better called just "Dark"
