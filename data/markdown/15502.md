### Description
Replaces the toolbar icon of the "XE.com Universal Currency Converter" (xeconv) add-on (http://www.xe.com/ffxtn/) with a base64 hard-coded new icon.

*** UPDATE - 21/04/2009 ***
Changed icon replacement approach by hiding the toolbarbutton-icon (opacity: 0) and setting the new icon as background.

*** DEVELOPERS NOTE ***
For some reason, the "list-style-image" technique (more proper, I think) doesn't work very well on my environment: sometimes the new icon simply disappears. This happens also concerning my style 15313. Does anybody hazard a guess?

See also my style 15501.
