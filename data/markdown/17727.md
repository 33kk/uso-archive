### Description
This code takes the boring old userstyles and turns it into an amazing orange cool thingy. Lol. For any reference you give out, or show in any video, please put a small reference in the corner saying By: K. Rampling. Enjoy! **Sorry if screenshots are unreadable. This is due to the picture being to large and taking up too much memory on the site.**
