### Description
We all love youtube for funny vids or whatever tickles your pickle, but yet again another site that should be utilising the screen width of the viewer.

Below is code i'm still working on, it will update as i work on it, but for the most part it's 100% and working.

Feel free to use and point out any areas of problem and i will correct them, it's easy with youtube they use lots of CSS.

All code thus far is what i'm using and playing with, so whether it's all required to work i don't know yet, all the same......... use as you choose...

Ads also removed, if i've missed some, again please point these out.

This covers the main site and videos area, i don't use the forum, so if this doesn't work there you'll have to add addition code yourself.
