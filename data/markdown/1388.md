### Description
this is a collection of styles for gmail available here, modified slightly. the idea is to have a single style instead of many smaller ones.

styles incorporated:
style 740 by user 552 (slightly modified, see below)
style 678 by user 370
style 275 by user 15
style 226 by user 74

the other styles are unmodified as of their revision current at 2006-11-24

I'm using a modified older version of the currently available 'gmail cleaner' style. the new version is a bit too extreme for me and I quite liked the old one. the only thing that was missing was the orange info bar for undo and stuff, and user 552 was very, very helpful with that. thanks for all your help!

so, just to reiterate... I'm not the author of any of this, I just compiled it... I know my way around CSS but haven't the slightest about skinning gmail.. this is just a collection of styles I use on gmail... all changes are final as approved by me... suggestions are welcome, tho :)

also, if you notice one of the incorporated styles updated, notify me and I'll consider updating this style to reflect the changes

I'm currently not happy with the way the primary font color (light blue) is applied. if anyone has a suggestion regarding that, do feel free to contact me
