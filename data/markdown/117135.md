### Description
This is a very very basic script where about 99% of the assets are from https://userstyles.org/styles/31267/global-dark-style-changes-everything-to-dark

i'm not much of a coder, all i did was change some color values and remove some unnecessary stuff

I'm aware that the theme is not the best


goes well with https://userstyles.org/styles/26318/mangaupdates-no-more-garbage
