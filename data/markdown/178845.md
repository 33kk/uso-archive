### Description
Change the colors of Disney+ to your preference! Also there are extra settings you can choose from!

I highly recommend using Stylus over Stylish for both Firefox and Chrome and other supported browsers, it's updated more frequently and because that is what i use for my browsers when i create these styles. So for the sake of consistency please consider using Stylus.

Here's a link to the add-on:
<a target="_blank" href="https://mzl.la/2sViJFk">Stylus for Firefox</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/39LlrOz">Stylus for Chrome</a>

If you're having trouble getting my styles to work or if there's anything else you'd like to ask or inform me of please contact me at <a href="mailto:Adam-J-Frost@outlook.com">Adam-J-Frost@outlook.com</a>.

If you would like to help me out, you can donate to me here: <a target="_blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/adamjfrost">Donate via Ko-fi</a>.

I hope you like this style and thank you for using it!
