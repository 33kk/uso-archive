### Description
Remove all the distracting stuff (other sites, chat rooms, meta posts, ads) from your vision, focusing in on resolving your technical problems first.

Based on hardy tomâ€™s original <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/110637/undistractify-stackoverflow">Undistractify StackOverflow</a> but adds removal of simple sidebar ads along with requests to join the site (for when you're signed out & don't want to bother signing in). Also adds more StackExchange domains that this style will apply to.
