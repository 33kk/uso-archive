### Description
Updated July 19, 2008
Fixed a couple tiny glitches, including not being able to see the red "this page doesn't exist yet" text on the wiki, and highlighting issues with a GM script.

Updated June 27, 2008
I added a dark gradient for more contrast, and actually included the images in the code. No need for the images to be hosted on photobucket anymore.

See screenshot for the general idea.
