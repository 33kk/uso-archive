### Description
I generally like the new Yahoo Mail design, but there's a lot of wasted vertical space in the header. Removes the branding and the links to other Yahoo properties, both of which I deem unnecessary.

Updated to work with any theme and the updated features that were rolled out on Dec 2, 2010.
