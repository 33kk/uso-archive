### Description
Update Log 23/11/2009

Updated again to deal with Zynga changes, improved positioning. Less chance of fight results overlapping opponents list.


Update Log 6/11/2009

Updated to account for Zygna changes.

Update Log 29/10/2009 (for US friends read 10/29/2009)

Some improvements:

Should align to left more reliably
Fight results should no longer obscure some of opponents
You should be able to see all items used now, though you will probably have to scroll. I know this is a pain, but at least it is a temporary fix that allows you to see the items. Ultimately the main aim of this script is to allow quick discharge of stamina - so that takes priority.

-- end of update



The idea here is to create an ideal interface for fighting - which in particular removes the need for scrolling up and down when choosing an opponent.

THIS IS IN BETA STAGE, SO NO SHOUTING IF IT DOESN'T WORK!

Please note after enabling the script you will need to refresh the page using the browsers reload button to get the best display.

This script is designed purely for fighting - I suggest you disable it when you have finished fighting otherwise you will not be able to see all the necessary navigation links.

You still see all the essential info such as your fight stats and any loot obtained, but it avoids the pictures of you and your opponent and your various weapons (though you can still click on 'show all items used' if you really do want to see a list of all weapons.
