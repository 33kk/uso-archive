### Description
Greatly condenses the Navigation Bar.  Removes Horizontal padding, making the toolbar very small and minimal.  Excellent style for those who want to conserve screen real-estate.  Works on Firefox2 AND Firefox3 !!

This style makes the LocationBar (Awesome Bar) much longer for those long URLs.  Toolbar Buttons on the Navigational Toolbar will be closer together.

Applies to:
- Firefox 3
- Firefox 2 

Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.
Works for BOTH Firefox 3 (AwesomeBar) AND Firefox 2 (LocationBar).
Why install an extension to do this, when you can do it through CSS!?

Integrates with Style 7463, and Style 7461.

OS Integration:
- Has been known not to work on Ubuntu Linux (while using Firefox3)
+ All other OS's should be good to go!

Changelog:
- Initial Release
