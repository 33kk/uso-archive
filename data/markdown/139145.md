### Description
"But I like to make articles..."
Yeah, me too. All you have to do is disable the style and after you're finished, put it back on.

I was looking for minimalistic and "nightmode" wikipedia styles. I found a lot of them, but they weren't my cup of tea. So I made one myself :)

This will be available for PT and EN, only. But please, feel free to create another section for your language and adding missing details (And send me the final product through feedback). The same goes to EN and PT users, in case you find something wrong/out of balance, please send me a feedback.

Also, there is no style for the front page yet.
