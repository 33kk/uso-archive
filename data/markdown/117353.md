### Description
This custom CSS expands the Voat.co central content area to cover most of the browser window. In addition, it increases the size of taglines and things like comment links to enable easier clicking. Padding in the main list of submissions is drastically lowered, enabling more to be seen on screen at once. Things like the sidebar, comment sections and long text posts are given scrollbars, turning off the need to scroll up and down the website. Additionally, comment usernames and voat information is condensed to the left side, acting much more like the user sections on forum posts. This style is designed for 1080p and Google Chrome, so if you use a different browser or have a different screen resolution, it may not work for you.
