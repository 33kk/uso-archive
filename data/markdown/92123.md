### Description
After some tuning, a darker paint job, and a bit of polishing I bring you this theme. With over 100 lines of CSS under the hood 'you're going to like the way it looks; I guarantee it' /endSalesPitch

### Update notes
<i>*updated link to js version since userscripts.org has shutdown.*</i>
-Only compatible with furaffinity's <i><b>Dark</b></i> theme.
-Always looking for suitable banners (1920x200)

also available at https://openuserjs.org/scripts/Artex/FurAffinity_-_Extra_Dark . If you have grease/tamper monkey then go ahead and try it out. will include functionality that could not be done with CSS alone. That includes the navigation bar sticking to the top of the screen when you scroll passed it.


I'll keep this up to date with any site changes(ha) and will update as i tweak anything. Suggestions, comments, or concerns? Leave a comment or note me at FA(<a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/artex./">Artex.</a>)
