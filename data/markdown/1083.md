### Description
Do you want a clean, quick way to read the headlines at DrudgeReport.com, with a clean sans-serif font? You know how hard it can be to read those headlines if you're running Linux instead of Windows, or if you're running Windows with your monitor set to a high screen resolution.

Drudge Report - Stripped to the bones is clean and simple -- and easy to read.

To change the headlines to any size you want, just edit this style and change "12px" and "40px" to bigger or smaller values.

Don't forget to also try my other style: style 588.
