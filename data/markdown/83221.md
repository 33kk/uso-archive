### Description
For reading posts, brings back some of the elegant compactness from the Halo.Bungie.Org forums, without messing too much with the overall aesthetics. Renders individual posts identically in thread, hierarchical, and single-post modes.

For the index pages, makes unread threads/posts bold, and vice versa, for easier scanning.
