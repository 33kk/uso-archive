Changelog:
0.5 unstable: Removed the video advertising on front page, the featured video list is now shorter and has a scroll bar, search form in the footer has been removed as there is already a sufficient search form up the top
0.2 stable:   Fixed logo bug where the header would overlap the content. This version only changes the header.
0.1 unstable:   First release. Small YouTube logo retained. Using large logo makes the header overlap the content. This version only changes the header
