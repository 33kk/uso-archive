### Description
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222085531/https://userstyles.org/styles/109825/hide-big-google-plus-g-header-images-profile-page">origin of this style</a> was to merely hide the larger header images. After a terrible <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/18/google-plus-new-design">UI update to G+</a> in late 2015, which Computerworld described as Google <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3007754/mobile-apps/is-google-murdering-google-with-poor-ui-design.html">murdering G+</a>, I decided to make various overall refinements to the G+ site.

Header images continue to be hidden. Perhaps overly extreme the collections and various other header stuff is now hidden (start a discussion if it's too much). Other changes are:

1. Shrunken header search-bar (it's thinner).
2. Improved side-bar menu. 
3. Tweaked border and shadow on posts. 
4. Left panel within each collection is neater.
5. Large new-post input-box area.
