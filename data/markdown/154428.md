### Description
***Sadly with Overleaf V2 the plugin stopped working. If you want to help, repairing it, get in touch with me :)***

This plugin changes the font of the Editor on Overleaf V1 to a better readable serif font.
This is only done for text content. Commands are kept in monospace to keep the view as clear as possible.
