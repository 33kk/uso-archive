### Description
This dark Wikipedia theme is a shameless rip-off of Angelo's "wikipedia.org - black & silver (adlc)", so go donate to the real creator.  [http://userstyles.org/styles/6044/wikipedia-org-black-silver-adlc]  I took out the replacement images to improve performance and tweaked the colors (IIRC), so the overall theme is still very much intact and easy on the eyes.
