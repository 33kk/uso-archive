### Description
Cleans up the new Live Calendar and the new hotmail. Removes the header navigation (But keeps the header itself so you can sign out, manage your account and see your personalizations), remove redundant items an useless ones too.

Also, there's some tweaks. You should be used with CSS to do it.
