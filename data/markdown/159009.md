### Description
Currently, this reduces the severity of the Compose button's border radius to match that of the search bar at the top of the page; it also changes the label navigation background's rounding to match the aforementioned items.

IMPORTANT: Select the Dark text background setting, otherwise it will not look right. I will be releasing a light-theme option soon for those who prefer that.
