### Description
A style to improve the readability of the Illinois Compiled Statutes. The law is monospace and very narrow, so I roughly doubled its width and made it use the default serif font.

The site uses a <em>very</em> hacky way to format something so simple and doesn't use any ids or even classes so there's only so much I can do, but this simple style improves readability a ton.
