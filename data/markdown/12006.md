### Description
This is basically whatever styles I've written for myself to use on Facebook, put into one style. Individually, most of them are too minor to warrant a single style, hence putting them all together. Included in this is:

-All ads removed
-Unused items removed - friend finder, and invite friends tools
-Minor color change on basic information box
-Input fields changed to have a white background instead of a grey one
-All 'fan news' removed from the feed
-Status updates have normal (small) size by default again
-All yellow explanatory tags are removed
-Wall posts have white background again, instead of blue
-Facebook Chat color scheme change
