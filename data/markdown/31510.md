### Description
Changes the buttons on Youtube to make them more aesthetically pleasing, as well as a few other modifications. I'll try and keep this updated as well as add new things as I see fit.

If I update something in a way you don't like, just comment out the code of the affected element- everything is labeled.
If you have an idea for something you would like to see added (life if you have a greasemonkey script adding elements), leave a comment and I'll add it.
