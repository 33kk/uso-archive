### Description
The purpose of this style is to remove all the annoying toolbars, dropdowns, and popups that frequently serve to distract me from pages I would otherwise enjoy.

My basic standard for considering something "junk" to remove is that it covers up the primary content of the page in some way that annoys me. I cannot wait until the collective web recognizes this junk for the blink_tag_2.0 that it is: Obnoxious and unnecessary.
