### Description
The idea behind many  of my styles   is to use minimum real estate for  toolbars. 

============================================================================
STYLE  NO  LONGER NEEDED ONCE YOU UPDATE  LAUNCHY
Launchy 4.3.0 finally changed icon, this style was created 2008-12-17 and is no longer needed as of 2010-01-27
will have to make some changes in my Navigation styles as well
-- Style 10881 (10881)
-- Style 18864 (18864)
-- Style 9349 (9349)
There are some tweaks to Dom Inspector here as well, will check on them later
