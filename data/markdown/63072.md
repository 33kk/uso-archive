### Description
This is exactly the same style as here http://userstyles.org/styles/19620/facebook-dark-static-transparency

...but with the following changes:
<ul>
<li>Main color for text can be picked just below!</li>
<li>no ads in the right panel</li>
<li>no background image</li>
<li>no glass texture background (except in top banner)</li>
<li>no blue shiny borders on buttons</li>
<li>no grey ball for offline friends in the chat</li>
<li>fixed the background color of the top sticky banner for the timeline view (appears when you scroll down)</li>
<li>fixed the position of the Privacy field when you post something</li>
<li>fixed the posts that go below the poster profile picture, now they sit next to it nicely</li>
</ul>

### Update notes
Unfortunately, styles that have customizable colors (in the case of this style, the text color) can't be updated from the Stylish style manager. If you want to get the latest version of the style, you have to remove it from Stylish and reinstall it from this page. I know, not cool :(

- 27/03: minor fixes
- 28/02:  002 (fixed)- when photos are posted, the photos preview goes below the poster name, instead of next to it
.         001 (fixed)- the text area to enter chat messages is too large and goes below the chat icon
