### Description
<mark><b>Important: Click the "Show CSS Code" button first. The install button will work after that. I highly recommend this <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/">style</a> that makes the "Show CSS Code" button much easier to find.</b></mark> ― Crunchyroll - Depremiumize or "Premium Removal" will remove anything related to premium membership; such as contents nagging you to try it, or to buy it! Anything that require a premium membership will be hidden, deleted from the site. From buttons in 720P, 1080P, to log-ins, sign-ups, banners, menus, links and more. If you're already a premium member, you obliviously don't need this style. ― <b>Version:</b> 1.0.0 | <a href="">View change logs</a>
