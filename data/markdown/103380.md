### Update notes
<b>Warning</b>: you may need to reload Workflowy for this style to take effect. I don't know why.
Note: the toolbar on top does get a little messed up at small widths. I hope to make a fix for it Some Dayâ„¢.

changelog:
<b>2017-05-23:</b> remove extra space on right side without causing horizontal scrolling
