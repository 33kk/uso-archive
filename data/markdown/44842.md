### Description
No idea who came up with the new design of gizmodo.com and why it should be an improvement. Anyhow, this style will get rid of the side bar and scale the blog view up to 953 px. I tested it in conjunction with Ad Block Plus for Firefox and it seems to work well. Make sure you access gizmodo through "http://gizmodo.com/#!classic" when using this style so you don't loose the pagination.
