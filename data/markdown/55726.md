### Description
This version is for Chromium (Chrome) only, you can find the Firefox version here:
style 55672
The main menu and search bar, is fixed, so it stays even if you scroll, it's minimized and expands on hover. Sidebars are fixed, they wont move either.
So when you scroll the only thing that moves is the main content section.
