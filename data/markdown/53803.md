### Description
Don't you hate the way TVGuide.com inserts those huge sponsored ads in the listings?

For now you will have to disable the style when it's not in use or it will erase the first channel listing.  I may be able to fix this in a future version.

21 September 2011 - I don't know how well this will continue to work.  I have already had to rewrite it twice after TV Guide changed the code.

Use at www.tvguide.com/listings/

03 DEC 2011 - Fixed a bug in Fx 4 and higher.
