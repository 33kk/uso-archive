### Description
Saves space by removing the content of the module when you edit its config and puts it back when you're done, showing just what you need, when you need it. This allows you to "flip" between them like you can with Dashboard Widgets on a Mac. The before/after shows the module content/config, respectively. 

Edit: added better screenshots
