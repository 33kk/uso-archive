### Description
I didn't liked the layout of Adobe's DevNet with the articles on the right side and information about the article on the left. I always found it very hard to read because on longer articles there was a huge white space on the left side. I changed this and switched the columns and also changed the font-family to sans-serif and reduced the line-height slightly.
