### Description
This is a minimalist dark theme for Twitch.tv (channel backgrounds, pictures, links, suggested channels, ect. are hidden on streamer pages).

### Update notes
Resolution Options Coming Soon!

Version 1.4 (beta edits)
-Made everything fit much better
-darkened some white lines that used to appear
-The directory is now flexible based on browser size/resolution
-Made it work with some of twitch's new beta changes
-Removed my old version that broke with many of the twitch updates. 
-This is now a beta only theme until twitch launches its new style permanently.
-In the process of adding more resolution choices.

Version 1.3 (beta edits)
- Added chat settings and viewer list clickable icons back next to chat button
- Darkened some of the buttons

Version 1.2
- Added a new beta version for the upcoming twitch update on the streamer channel pages
- In order to test the beta out: 
    1. Reinstall this theme with the "New Beta Twitch Version" selected from the selection box up near the top of this page
    2. Go to a channel and type /new after their channel url -- for example: http://www.twitch.tv/hurricanesandython/new
-I tried to keep most things the same as the old version.

Version 1.1
- Revealed the streamer's custom title
- Chat background is now dark

Version 1.0
The font has been changed to what it used to be on Justin.tv (much easier on the eyes in my opinion). The channel title / banner / information have all been removed to allow for a much more simplified and clean viewing experience. The directories have been widened and show more game boxes per row and the stream preview thumbnails have been slightly shrunk in height and width to allow more to be listed per row.

This is my first attempt at a user style, mostly because I hated the changes twitch.tv made in their "purple" update. Any feedback is welcome, I'm still learning as I go so I will no doubt improve this style as time goes on.

You can send a personal message to me at electricgel on twitch.tv with any feedback / concerns / requests.
