### Description
My personal mash-up and tweaking of "Shrink Your Habitica Tasks" By Adilendian & mareinna, "Habitica Compact Light Header" & "Habitica Collapse Drawers until hover" by sonnet73, "Habitica Smaller Header" by ensorceled, and "DeepDark Habitica" by Metsatron. Of some I took actual parts of their styles, others provided inspiration. Each of these styles had something I liked and something I didn't, so here is mine.
