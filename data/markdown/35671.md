### Description
<p><strong>Enjoy a cleaner, less cluttered reading experience on your favorite blogs and news sites.</strong></p>

<p>Bloggers are going nuts with all of the sharing icons at the end of their posts -- cluttering up the screen with buttons of all different shapes and sizes, and channeling web design practices from 1999. Buzzkill hides the Facebook "Like" button, the Google "+1" button, the Twitter "Tweet" button, the Tweetmeme "retweet" button, and tons of other social sharing buttons that you never use.</p>
