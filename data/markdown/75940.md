### Description
Makes specific Metacritic pages nice and charcoal-y.  The font family was changed to arial, as well.

It's incomplete in that I've only messed with stuff that 90% of people use--that is, displaying search results for movies, games, and shows.  A lot of the site content, like user info, main page stuff, and other things aren't touched.

The menus are hard to read because of the link color, and the background images that I have not yet messed with.
