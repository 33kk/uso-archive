### Description
This makes Swagbucks.com (http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/TheMynock) easier to read for people with high resolution, wide screens (I'm using it on a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution).  You can adjust the width in the code if you are using a lower resolution (or a higher one, I guess).
