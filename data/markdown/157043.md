### Description
- Changes all elements on 4chan pages to grays and black except for text.
- Removes box shadows from all elements that have them.
- Adds additional "Replies," "Images," "Posters," and "Page" text to thread statistics.
- Changes the "Return" link in the catalog to say "Index" instead.
- Makes it so filenames are no longer truncated with "(...)".
- Hides horizontal rules that are no longer necessary when ads are not displayed.
- Includes elements specific to 4chan X.
- Sets border radius to 0 for all 4chan X elements that have a border radius greater than 0.

Intended to be used with the default style setting in which the style is set to Yotsuba or Yotsuba B depending on if the board being browsed is "work safe" or not, and for this reason, text colors have been left untouched to keep the indication of a board's work-safe status intact.
