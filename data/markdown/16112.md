### Description
Like style 15636 By user 20679
Updated to work with Gmail (non-beta)
Utilize this conglomeration of styles by enabling the following in Gmail labs:
Quick links |	Navbar drag and drop | Google Calendar gadget
While this style is not enabled, save a quick link for any menu item, like chat or starred, that you would like to see in the drop down. 
Drag your chat to the bottom and set to tiny or medium depending on your screen size. My macbook 13" looks best with tiny.
This style highlights lines. You can change the color.
This will also move the footer to the top while removing tips, gmail view, and copyright.
UPDATE reduces the space around Inbox menu to free up real estate on the right side of the screen.
Changes font to Gill Sans.
UPDATE lets you know that this doesn't work for gmail 5.10.2011
