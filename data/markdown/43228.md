### Description
This is mostly identical to style 17742 by user 22919. It's Linux-only, though.

I improved some of the margins from style 17742, and moved the URL textbox to share the line with the "Insert" button.
Instead of using Data URIs to embed PNG images, I loaded the native icons from the Linux distro. Whenever I change my icon theme, the icons in this style *should* change as well, without requiring a restart of Firefox.

I've tested this on... Ubuntu. That's it. The screenshot shows the style enabled, using the Faenza icon theme.
