### Description
This style aims to make navigating through the new Klei Entertainment's forums a more pleasant experience, by increasing contrast where it was too low, and decreasing it where it was too high.

Improvements on syntax highlighting are also included, based on KDE's palette for the Lua language.

Additionally, it fixes the issue where long signatures without whitespace don't break lines.

This version has fully configurable colors (but no automatic updating).

### Update notes
The configuration options are:
<b>Background Color</b>
<b>Post Header Background</b>: Background for the header of a post (surrounding the post author's name)
<b>Post Background</b>
<b>Primary Text Color</b>: Default post color
<b>Secondary Text Color</b>: For things such as subforum description and thread information (such as "Started by...")
<b>Signature Text Color</b>: Default signature color
<b>Primary Link Color</b>: For things such as the (non-Moderator, non-Dev) author name below a thread title
<b>Secondary Link Color</b>: For things such as reply count
<b>Pages Link Color</b>: For links such as "Page 1 of 4"
<b>Post Number Color</b>: For the post number displayed on its top right corner within a thread

<b>Code String</b>
