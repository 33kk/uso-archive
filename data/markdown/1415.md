### Description
Trademe New Zealands Auction site, colour change was made to have a different look.

This is my 2nd attempt and working out how mod a websites css, i noticed trademe have not set there gfx backgrounds to transparent, so colour changing is a sad on that.

I can't find instructions and rules on for slyles,  I know about little css, any tips? I'm still working out how to make inline comments lol.

I have dumped some of the gfx also thanks to ad blocking. and i think my colours suck.
