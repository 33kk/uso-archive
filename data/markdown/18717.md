### Description
I did not make this generally. I just combined some of the scripts like no ads and last.fm restructured and no radio and the simple and clean style modification. NOTE: needs to be corrected at some places, because i don't have the slightest idea how to make any modifications in css or xhtml or whatever so please help me out. Apologizes to anyone who think hes got raid.
