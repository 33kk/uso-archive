### Description
This is essentially the dark version of "reddit minimalist". It is also a very old theme that I rarely if ever update.

Turn off "allow reddits to show me custom styles" in your Reddit preferences, or else you'll get overlapping CSS themes and weird positioning will happen.

I personally use my "reddit flat dark" theme.
