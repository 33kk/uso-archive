### Description
Makes supporting easy on the eyes. Dark grey (not just filter-inverted). Only the Dashboard, other pages are not affected. Also only CodeCanyon. Removed box to upload new item (currently not interested in that, line 116) and the link to mobile dashboard. All this in favor of the weekly sales stats.
