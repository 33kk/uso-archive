### Update notes
<b>CHANGELOG</b>

<b>[jul 09, 2015]</b>
- now supports more than 2 columns on larger screen-widths by using media queries.
< 800px: 1 column
< 1600px: 2 columns
> 1600px: 3 columns
> 2500px: 4 columns
- added a small border because it looks better with it.
- the upper grey header is now thiner.

<b>[jul 11, 2015]</b>
- minor bugfixes for bugs caused by the slimmer border.
- more users are now displayed in the right expandable area of groups and it now has higher contrast for better readability.
- now removes the border on screens smaller than 1300px.
- now displays larger messagetext on large screens.
- you can now set a custom background. The background is colored brighter so it does not reduce the readability of the messages.

<b>[jul 15, 2015]</b>
- increased the visibility of the wallpaper behind the chat messages
- corrected the position of the lenght information next to audio messages. They were offset because the messages don't have fixed widths anymore.
- fixed the audio progress bar width
- adjusted the space on the left and right of the messages

<b>[jul 16, 2015]</b>
- corrected the image size, image overflow and added a black background to the image bubbles, because with this skin the image bubbles are going to scale wider or narrower than the image thumbs width. Now this doesn't bother anymore.

<b>[jul 30, 2015]</b>
- accidentaly disabled the ability to add custom backgrounds. fixed now.

<b>[aug 06, 2015]</b>
- fixed the width of the unread-messages bar. Because it was disappearing as soon as i tried to check the css classes of it I had trouble finding them out. But now it works.

<b>[sep 03, 2015]</b>
- changed how preview-images and videothumbs are displayed
- added some space between images and the bottom edge of the screen in the image-viewer
- now supports control over the bg-tint in a dropdown menu

<b>[oct 31, 2015]</b>
- custom background stopped working, fixed now

<b>[jan 10, 2016]</b>
- fixed the msgs padding
