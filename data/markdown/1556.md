### Description
A dark stylesheet with yellow text, pale red links and and think, dark green paragraph borders. Doesn't get in the way; gets rid of most of the built-in styling but keeps paragraph borders so things still look structures. 

Works pretty good with style 258; which is how I use it; the logo blocks out part of the title but it's not a major issue. 

Also, hides that annoying fundraising section :-P
