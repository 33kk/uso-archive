### Description
An emergency operation to quickly and seamlessly sew Elise's head & pages together, because she is defiantly NOT alright.

### Update notes
Tested and believed to be working on both Firefox and Firefox Android.

Because of the way the chapters seem to be uploaded (manually inserted into page), their is inconsistency between different chapters. As such, there is a chance that some future chapter may still have gaps with this. tested up to chapter 50.

In order to ensure images did not have gaps, line spacing was removed from various places. This may cause text from the description at the top of the chapter to overlap with itself. It wont be a problem for most chapters, since I substituted it with margins, but a few have really long descriptions that are affected (doesn't hurt the images though).
