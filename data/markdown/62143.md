### Description
This fixes a few problems the userscript "YouTube Enhancer" has (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33042). I started this just to fix some of these issues for myself, but if you have any requests, please let me know.

Features currently working:

Playlists:
 * Fix the size of the bottom nav bar so it no longer covers the video in "Best" mode
 * When maximized, the playlist can be scaled to any size. This is so you can navigate a playlist, even when sitting far away
 * Fixed overlapping issues with the YouTube Enhancer controls
 * Stops buttons from forcing an overflow on mouseover. This prevents horizontal scroll bars from appearing at the bottom of the page
 * Make the Youtube front page and subscription page wider with larger thumbnails.

<b>More Coming Soon!</b>
