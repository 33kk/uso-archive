### Description
Yet another vista layout userstyle:
It adds a menu background similar to the effect vista uses for the titlebar. It also sets a more vista-ish background for the bookmarks toolbar.

The style needs the Glasser extension to add the vista glass effect. I also recommend the Hide Menubar extension.

Hope you like it. I've been using it for a while now and thought others might enjoy it as well.

The menubar background image is located here:

So if you need to widen/shrink it feel free to do so.

Now updated for Firefox 3.5b99 Preview.
