### Description
I find that having the "send to" field in Delicious.com's save page can sometimes get in the way of Delicious.com's tag completion when you hit the Tab key; instead of completing the tag, it takes you to the "send to" field.  Since I only rarely use Delicious.com's send-to functionality, this userscript hides it.
