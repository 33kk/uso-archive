### Description
Version 1.3

The overclockers UK forum members took it upon themselves to redefine the way we see the forums in a dark, subtle, yet easier on the eyes design.

The following members completed the initial design. 
Rob Miller, Barney Lockwood & FamFamFam

Although the design is very nice i find it some what greyscale, lacking any defining colours.

I took the design already made and re-wrote some classes, added new ones, fixed some bugs and added more colour. A full listing & screenshots can be found on the forum at overclockers, HTML forum section.

Updated 03/10/08 - Just a few minor fixes such as [php] areas etc.....
Updated 24/11/08 - Few changes here and there, banner cell hidden completely, logo centered, nav boxes given hover effect.. and so on...
