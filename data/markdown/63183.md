### Description
Makes the main column (articles and their discussion thread) wider. Makes links blue, therefore more visible for people such as myself who have difficulty distinguishig red from black text. Link colour part shamelessly copied from the style called Rock, Paper, Shotgun: Clearer links. Apologies, and thanks for sharing to the author.
