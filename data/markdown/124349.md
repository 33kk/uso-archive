### Description
This is a hodgepodge of ideas I found in other userstyles (see below) for workflowy, then augmented to handle specific tags with # and @ that I use to see at-a-glance what seems important. I put everything I have to do, have done, meetings, phone calls, skype, procedures, miscellaneous lists, ideas, programming tasks, etc. into workflowy, all within an overall Journal > Year > Month > Date > format,
