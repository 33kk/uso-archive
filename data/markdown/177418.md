### Description
<p>A dark theme for the <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome">AdGuard-Home</a> web interface. I have tried to address all parts of the interface other than the initial installation process, but some may have been overlooked.</p><p>I sometimes make <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/867056">dark CSS themes</a> and <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/users/437117-ultrabenosaurus?sort=name">JS userscripts</a>. Some of them aren't terrible.</p>

### Update notes
<p><b>Instructions</b><br>You will need to specify the IP address or internal domain name on which you are running your installation of AdGuard-Home.</p><p><b>Credits</b><br>Originally based on CSS by GitHub user carlbennett in <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/613">this issue thread</a>, it has been heavily altered and expanded on primarily for navigation elements and the Query Log.</p><p><b>Apologies</b><br>I apologise to anyone who does CSS for a living as I have done this with a brute-force method and it could probably be a lot more elegant.</p><p><b>Changelog</b><br><b>v1.6 -</b> Apparently the Query Log has blue rows for PTR / "Rewritten by the hosts file rule" entries; now they're dark blue instead of nearly white.<br><b>v1.5 -</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Now works with the Tags section of the New Client modal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Changed default font from <em>inherit</em> to <em>sans-serif</em>.<br><b>v1.4 -</b> Added rules for new Block buttons in the Top Clients panel of the Dashboard.<br><b>v1.3 -</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Changed loading overlays on Query Log page from white to black.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Fixed background colour of inline action buttons on the Query Log page.<br><b>v1.2 -</b> Added styling for the new version alert banner.<br><b>v1.1 -</b> Fix the mobile navigation menu styles.</p>
