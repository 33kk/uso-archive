### Description
This style is for the Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox 4 or greater.

By default, it allows for your single bookmarks to appears just as fav icons whilst keeping folders with their labels.

If you prefer to show all bookmarks including folders without their labels, choose the option to "Show no labels at all" below.

### Update notes
To improve the layout of your bookmarks there are 2 methods I suggest:

1) Right-click your Navigation Toolbar and choose Customise. From here, grab a Flexible Space and drag it to the very start of your Bookmarks Toolbar. Now everything will be centered.

2) Download a lightweight addon called SortPlaces (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sortplaces/). This keeps your bookmark folders and single bookmarks alphabetically sorted. 

Enjoy (:
