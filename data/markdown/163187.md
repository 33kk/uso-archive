### Description
I can't wrap my head around the color scheme changes that occurred during 2017 for Service-Now.com instances. The left side USED to have the dark header categories, and lighter colored sub-categories. Somewhere in 2017, they FLIPPED the two values, and I've been lost ever since that "upgrade".
