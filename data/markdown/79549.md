### Description
UPDATED: 12-7 :)

Youtube left-aligned their layout on 12-6, this appropriately centers the content for widescreen monitors.

Works best on higher resolutions! Youtube's new "Guide" makes a centered layout look bad on small resolutions.

EDIT: Fixed search results, member bar and page backgrounds, guide positioning
