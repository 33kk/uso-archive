### Description
There is not much to be found for Zoho Mail yet, so I hope this is as useful for you as it is for me.

This is an "Zoho Mail" style. Visually it just removes the overwhelming white in the mailbox( Zoho Mail  does not uses schemes) , 
and has an nice green instead. Side bar remains white for better visual effect. Other elements I did not bother with, maybe later.

I would be great to see more styles for this mail service.
