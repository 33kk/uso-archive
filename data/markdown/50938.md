### Description
<strike>With the introduction of a new Facebook chat in July 2011, lots of unconnected friends are now displayed in chat panel, which is quite useless. This style hides them, showing only connected (available and idle) friends.</strike>

<strike>You may prefer rendering offline contacts subtler without removing them. In this case, try style 51000.</strike>

<strike>Also available as an add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tidy-facebook-chat</strike>

<strong>Facebook updated their code in February 2014. The new markup for the chat is unintelligible and the userstyle wonâ€™t work anymore. Sorry!</strong>
