### Description
To begin with, I have to thank user 3059 for allowing me to use his work ^^
The original can be found here: style 4115

This style will give directory/ftp listings, local images (_except_ svg), and *sigh* some local html pages a dark look.
If "white for all" doesn't suit you, try it :)

Regarding user 3059 original style, I felt grey/black too monochromatic so I added a little DeviantArt touch in it (green mouseover effects)

Notes:
- If you want to disable this skin, uncheck it in stylish then restart firefox.
- Local web pages may have their design affected by this style. They can turn better... or worse. If you think you can improve it, feel free to let me know.
