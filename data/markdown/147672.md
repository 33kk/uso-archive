### Description
Forces all websites to use a dark grey background and light grey text for nighttime viewing by default, but you can use this to make all websites use the colors you want! Some things may stay the colors they are supposed to as <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/198">Stylus' !important's don't take priority over the website's ones</a>, an error in my opinion.

If this style is enabled, colors will be hard to customize. Disable this before editing the foreground and background color.

### Update notes
Added opacity-forcing.
