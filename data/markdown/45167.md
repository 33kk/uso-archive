### Description
Collapses tabs down to a smaller size (when you have many open) and expands them on hover so you can see a preview of the page title.

Would probably work better with a left-aligned close button. There are some usability issues when closing multiple tabs right now, but people with middle mouse buttons should do fine. Without heavy javascripting and/or another solution, we can't help this. 

Any tips on how to improve this style are very welcome!
