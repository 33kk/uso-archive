### Description
[Rate and discuss!]
Resizes the <B>wide</b> (expanded but not fullscreen) layout to 720p instead of 480p so you can view 720p in full resolution without the need of going fullscreen. Also tweaks the featured-sidebar to fill the newly created whitespace by creating two columns instead of one.

I use it myself, so when it breaks will mostly be updated in less than a day.
