### Description
Removes a lot of advertising and such from the pastebin website. Other minor changes are made as well. Best for users who don't wanna pay for Pastebin. Enjoy! Also, new update (added some more stuff, idk lol) as of June 21, 2017 (as I write this, that's the current date in areas where the EST time zone is used)!<br /><br /><b>~ <span style="color: #3498db !important;"><a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/blob/master/README.md">Use of this userstyle is recommended with Stylus.
