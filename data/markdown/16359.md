### Description
I noticed that I couldn't find any ad removal scripts or styles for mmo-champion.com so I went ahead and made my own.  This removes the ads on the very top header, the left navigation bar, and the ad by the latest news/comments and forums posts area.

Here's an after screenshot (due to the limit on size on userstyles): http://i40.tinypic.com/35cfw28.png

*UPDATE:  I've noticed that some ads by the lastest news/forums still pop up from time to time, trying to work out the kinks for that.  So far, I made a small update to fix more of that.
*UPDATE 2:  I noticed that some wowhead links in certain posts were not working, so I went ahead and fixed that.
