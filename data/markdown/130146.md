### Update notes
<strong>Options:</strong>
Avatar/Signature show and hide are self explanatory. Hide Default Avatar hides the avatars from those without one specified on their account.

Minimal chat style removes the avatars and formatting lines from the chat to make it look more like an IRC style chat. You can view many more messages on one screen due to this feature and I personally find it the most useful. Hardcore mode downsizes all emojis and compresses text even further. 

If you are a moderator, please specify yes when asked or you may have buttons overlay with the page numbers on topics.

Text style allows you to compress the text, this sets the line height back to default so that there is less vertical space in-between text on the forum. This affects ALL text on ModMe. <strong>If you are using Compressed Text and Minimal Chat, this is the equivalent of hardcore minimal and you will need to select the hardcore minimal chat option or your chat messages will be slightly misaligned.</strong>
