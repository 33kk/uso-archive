### Description
This simple CSS changes your Twitter navigation bar background that is originally white. Unfortunately, I can't make it to look like the old Twitter :(

Anyway, if you didn't like the image I provide, simply upload it there, recommended width is your current screen width, and if it's smaller than your screen, it'll be tiled :)
