### Description
I've set the default for #777 (gray)
I also put in a line to change the paging highlight to match this same #777 color.

You can edit this to make it any color you like, by changing that number.  You may need to also change the color of the text to make things readable if you do.

#669 is a nice faded blue color for this purpose.
#779 is good, too.  * This is the one I'm currently using myself.

The screenshot was taken with this following one installed, too, with a smaller menu bar.
