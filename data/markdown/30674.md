### Description
The New York Times inexplicably runs columns by dim-witted herald of free enterprise John Tierney
in the "science" section (rather than "Opinion", or Circular File" sections.)

This style saves one the time and frustration of accidentally clicking on what one thought might
be science reporting and instead landing in the cesspool of Ayn Rand American free enterprise
blather that is columnist John Tierney's output.

Better would would be to nuke such links {display: none} altogether.
This merely adds a strike-through (text-decoration: line-through) decoration.
