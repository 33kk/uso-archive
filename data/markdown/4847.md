### Description
Another Runescape style I made, this time a bit more involved and for the main page. It strips off a lot of junk that I (and you) probably don't use, and that shrinks it down. It also cuts the news posts to only the four most recent and shrinks the font (mouse over it to expand.) 

I gave it a simple, grey-black feel similar to my style 4842.

Enjoy!
