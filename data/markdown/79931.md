### Description
My take on bringing the new YouTube layout back to where it belongs. This style is currently only tested and working in Firefox and Chrome. I can't guarantee that it will work perfectly in other browsers.

Things I have modified:
- Brought the whole YouTube page back to the center
- Some very minor, improvements

Compatibility:
Firefox: 100%
Chrome: 100%
Others: Not tested
