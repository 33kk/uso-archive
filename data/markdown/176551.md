### Description
Discogs avatars (user icons) can be images uploaded to Discogs or Gravatar. If you block Gravatar for privacy purposes, or if a user account is disabled, some icons will be missing/broken. This style hides those broken images and effectively replaced them with the generic Gravatar icon, generated internally. Avatars hosted by Discogs will still work.
