### Description
Why did I create this?: Because the St. Paul's Community is way too bright, too much white. It hurts my eyes to look at it, the white point is just too intense. So, I created this and decided that if anyone else were smart enough to use Stylish, they shouldn't have to suffer too. 
TL;DR: The old community style burned my eyeballs out of my skull


I don't have much experience with CSS, but I managed to pick out the background for the login screen only. Made it darker. As I learn more CSS, I will update this style. But until then, this will at least help.
Update: No longer a work in progress, complete version now released.
