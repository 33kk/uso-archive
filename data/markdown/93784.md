### Description
-----EDIT----
The icons for the text, photo, ect, have been finally fixed where they show above the default icons. The only way I know how to fix this for people who already have this installed is the remove it and then to reinstall the style.

The only other thing that has not been fixed is that the background will show up when you make text post, and messages sometimes. I do not at the moment know how to fix that. So if anyone dose please send a message and I will fix it pronto.
----END EDIT----

I was told of two errors. One of the background image being cut off for smaller screens, and for the logo to be click able. Thank you hideheader for telling me about them, and the codes that will fix it. <3
Again if anyone sees any errors please let me know, and if you know how to fix it the help is welcomed. <3
