"<i>Gypsum plaster, or plaster of Paris, is produced by heating gypsum to about 150 Â°C. When the dry plaster powder is mixed with water, it re-forms into gypsum.

A large gypsum deposit at Montmartre in Paris led "calcined gypsum" (roasted gypsum or gypsum plaster) to be commonly known as 'plaster of Paris'.</i>" <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster#Gypsum_plaster_.28plaster_of_Paris.29">*</a></sup>
