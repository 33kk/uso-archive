### Description
An updated version of my last userstyles.org style (because the older one needed some work due to the various site updates since I last looked at it--and I needed something that works properly). This style just cleans things up some and provides a slightly different look from the default--no really big changes (well, except for that thing on the left).

I think the coding is mostly complete, but I'm sure I'll find half a dozen errors tomorrow.
