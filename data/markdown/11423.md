### Description
An easy on the eyes web style optimized for small screens and vertically oriented displays. All ads are blocked.
The search results are stretched to occupy the whole screen and prettified using rounded borders and hover effects.
Especially useful if you use the search query for 100 results on every page.
I have also included the result counter (uncomment it to use)

Based on the pastel blue style for google search.

UPDATE v1.1
New ad element #rhsline blocked

UPDATE v1.11
Thank you m&m for your kind comment.
Added www.google.fr out of respect :)
