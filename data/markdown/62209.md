### Description
Yet Another Dark Theme for Reddit (Old). Assumes RES is installed, but will work without it.
Restyles everything, without changing the familiar layout. 

Chrome doesn't support APNG, so the spinning Arrows won't spin, just flash.
Get Firefox or Pale Moon.

PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK!

### Update notes
I've been having issues with reddit, but after about a year of testing, I dont't think it's this code, sorry for the long wait! If you are having problems, see style 104092.

Probably resource heavy, with lots of box-shadows and rgba backgrounds.

Hides the logout button, and makes the comments occupy the whole screen, and are indented at the start of paragraphs.
But it's all fairly well commented so you can change it as you see fit.
