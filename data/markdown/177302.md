### Description
***This style is still being updated, if there is something still off about it please let me know!***

This style brings back the old style of Roblox which lasted from early 2019 - late 2019. It changes every part of the site to look like how it used to. Dark mode is currently in beta as there are some problems with it but it mostly works fine, and light mode works perfectly well.

Someone else is working on a proper 2016 theme built off of this one, it's still a wip but it's looking really nice at the moment! If you want a true 2016 roblox experience I recommend following this style's development: https://userstyles.org/styles/178105/roblox-in-2016

### Update notes
---LATEST UPDATE---

+ Fixed the avatar page, the avatar background now shows up in 2D and the avatar viewer icons all actually fit now

+ Fixed up some more colours

This style is like 95% complete now, i still want to fully fix up dark mode as well but light mode should be almost perfect now. Please keep telling me about any problems that arise, I'm not as active on this as I used to be but I promise I am still working on it from time to time.
