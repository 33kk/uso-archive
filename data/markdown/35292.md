### Description
Makes the Starfleet Commander game interface optimized for maximum space, even more then my other style "Blue Smoothy" - http://userstyles.org/styles/30623

The navigation and planets stay stuck to the top left of the screen and the content scrolls up and down.

This style works on Extreme and the NEW Uni-2 as well.
