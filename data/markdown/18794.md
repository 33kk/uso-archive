### Description
TwitterFox is my favorite Twitter add-on for Firefox. But unfortunately, I dislike their themes. Their default theme is very bright and intrusive. The black theme in their new update is also not to my liking. So I went ahead and customized the theme to suit my needs. Hopefully you find it useful too. Let me know your comments.

Modifications Done:

- I have just changed the styles of the messages. 
- I have used white background for read messages and a light gray background for unread messages. 
- I have tried to mimic the actual twitter UI with dash-ed borders, white background, Arial font for messages and Georgia italic font for the message  meta data. 
- The messages in all the 3 tabs sport the same styles.
- I have retained the same blue color for the window frame, retaining the identity of TwitterFox.
- I have also tested with the black theme and no issues in that theme too.

Style 17808 by user 3418 was my inspiration and the starting point for my customization.

Note: I have tested this on Firefox 3 and above and with TwitterFox version 1.8.1 and above
