### Description
This theme allows the user to write in a simple and distraction free environment, by providing Google Docs of a classic computer aesthetic, while also allowing the user to customize the colors of the UI to his personal liking.

Thanks for visiting.

Tips:
- The theme is best used in full screen mode, press F11 (for most browsers) to enable this feature.

- The Google Docs UI can be hidden, under:

View >> Full screen

- Increasing the value of the property "Text selection shadow radius", adds a shadow to the borders of the sheet, also as the name suggests, it adds a shadow to the selected text container.

Special thanks to GRRM, who inspired the coding of this style.
