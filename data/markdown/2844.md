### Description
GNU Gnatsweb is rather ugly. I wanted to make it slightly less offensive, but as the version we use (4.0) was marked up some time in the 1990s, it was tricky to do anything too ambitious.

Note that you'll need to change the domain in the url-prefix line to match the location of your own Gnatsweb installation.
