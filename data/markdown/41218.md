### Description
This is the most installed Toodledo Userstyle that works with the new site, with over 4,800 installs and counting!

This is a style based on colors and designs found in Mac OS X and featuring other general UI enhancements. The old version of this userstyle was very popular, but when Toodledo redesigned their interface, it broke the functionality. I have completely rewritten it from scratch to function with the new Toodledo design.

Toodledo is very powerful and everyone uses it in their own way, but I try to accommodate as many different views as possible. I will continue to evolve this theme including styling the other pages of Toodledo.com (forums, help, login, etc).

If you have any suggestions/recommendations/bug reports, please use the comments area of this page, the thread in the Toodledo Tips and Tricks forum, or email me at earnjam@gmail.com.  Enjoy!
