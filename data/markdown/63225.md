### Description
For anyone who finds the new Fitocracy layout a bit too heavy on the whitespace, and on the purple - shifts the spacing so that your posts are about 50% wider, keeping most other elements fairly similar. Now also supports choosing your own banner colour.

### Update notes
Seems to work quite well; fixed as I find issues or the site's own CSS changes.
