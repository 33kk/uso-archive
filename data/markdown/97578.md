### Description
Just some tweaks I made because I didn't like tweetdeck's default style, I did it for myself, but I'm sharing in case anyone cares.

I did a version with scrollbar auto-display too (instead of simply disabling them) -> http://userstyles.org/styles/97579/tweetdeck-moar-flat-design-auto-scrollbars

Changes:
- Everything is now squares (no rounding)
- Column titles take less space
- No scroll bars (still scrollable via mousewheel)
- Button labels do not show
- Composing
