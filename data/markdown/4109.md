### Description
Remove the "Please Read This!" section on the News Feed (maybe elsewhere, too?).  This section typically has things like "add security questions" or "add your birthday" for people who added accounts before those required bits were introduced.  We're grandfathered in and we don't want to add that information.  Thanks.
