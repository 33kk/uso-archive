### Description
Version 1 ~ Wind!

Created by Leaf/Sigmap/Josu/JR, this theme is meant to bring out the true light form of Brick Hill. Brother of "Brick Hill Dark Mode", this theme will receive regular updates until it hits a point where there is nothing to change. Also, BHLM (Brick Hill Light Mode) can be runned by itself, so no extra themes are necessary!
