### Description
Makes the Youtube player take up the whole screen when in cinema mode and makes the search bar invisible until hovered over (top of the screen). Made for the new experimental design of Youtube.

Also includes an option to style the Min Vid Addon for Firefox options and hide it off to left side of the video just under where the search bar ends, mouse over to show.
