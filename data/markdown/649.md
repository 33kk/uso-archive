### Description
Emoticons will load instantly instead of having to wait for the (often bogged down) IGN media server.

EDIT: Apparently, now userstyles.org limits us to 65k characters, which is what messed this script up.  It worked fine before.  I've had to compress a few of the emoticons so that it would all fit within the userstyles.org limit.

EDIT 2: I got the data strings by using this site:
