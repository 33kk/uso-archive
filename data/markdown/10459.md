### Description
Stylesheet replaces 4px dotted with 4px solid in hopes of making less work for the producers. 4px dotted will need to be manually removed from homepage and select spots on other section fronts, but they won't be too obtrusive even if not removed. In Bonzai, we could just change the name of the style. This also makes it a more worthy replacement when it comes to topic pages, where the 4px dotted was slotted beneath the page header.

h3 section headers no longer have a 4px dotted line installed below. This should save producers from having to remove the 1px dotted line that had been manually slotted beneath most section headers.

Other additions to this stylesheet: 
â€¢ Subsection headers a linkable in the same way that section headers are.
