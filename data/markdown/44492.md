### Description
This is a modified version of http://userstyles.org/styles/38780 , with a dark color scheme and some formatting changes for maximum readability and minimal eye strain. Clean interface with subtle gradients, no screen real estate wasted. Special coding for r/trees included. More screenshots here: http://imgur.com/a/hFsrB

*As with all userstyles, go to reddit preferences and turn off "Allow subreddits to show me custom styles".

*If you have Reddit Enhancement Suite, you also need to disable the "Style Tweaks" Module" under RES preferences...If you absolutely need your comment boxes, http://userstyles.org/styles/31983/reddit-comment-boxes-for-the-dark-reddit can be used in conjunction with this style.

*There are links in the update section below to scripts that re-enable certain subreddit's appearances, be sure to look at them.
