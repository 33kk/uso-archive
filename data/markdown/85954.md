### Description
This style is mainly for use in a mobile device. Gives the same effect of http://userstyles.org/styles/13864/black-background-light-text-pitchdark-companion-i

IMP : This is a global style. Will affect all the sites you visit. Screenshot shown is of twitter.com

It renders most sites in a black background and light color glare free text colors. If the site uses excessive background images, this style cannot do much. For all the other well behaved sites, you will notice a much pleasant experience.

It saves battery power, screen life as well as your eyes.

I use it with Android ICS, Firefox 20+.
