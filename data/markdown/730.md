### Description
Removes the top banners and the logo image (that stuff takes more than half screen heigh at a 1280x1024 resolution!) from www.psxgen.net/forum , for max usability. Works only for logged users.

Working fine on 08/01/2006. Maybe works for other Invision based boards too.

Just testing how easy would be to make a first style. :)
