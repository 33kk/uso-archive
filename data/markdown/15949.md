### Description
In the newest Facebook layout - this does 3 small simple things I found useful:
1. Makes the hidden filters in the filter list always visible
2. Hides the "More >" link under those which is now obsolete
3. Hides the instructions to drag & drop which are obvious to most of us and if not, they really don't need to be displayed all the time
