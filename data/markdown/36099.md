### Description
Remove the following distracting time-wasters from the Twitter sidebar:

- Who to follow
- Trending Topics
- Following (We can just click the link at the top when we need to)
- Promotions
- That explanatory "Lists are..." message that you've already seen a million times

Result: A refreshingly un-cluttered, functional sidebar that needs no scrolling to view.
