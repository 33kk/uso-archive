### Description
A (more) modern theme for Connexus (Connections Education, EMS).  Changes the right sidebar to a light grey (can be changed easily in the CSS); adds some shadows and border radius to certain parts and increases contrast in places.  Mainly changes the Connexus homepage, but now has large changes to lessons and minor changes to other pages.

### Update notes
Customization has been re-added!  (or rather added for the first time, as I don't think it worked in the past)  (13/12/2018)
I have gotten rid of my planner styles and will start over from scratch in FireFox -- something was wrong, but I intend to fix it.  (4/12/2018)
Just discovered some oddities in the planner in FireFox after reloading the page.... I have no idea what's wrong, but will work on it.  (12/09/2018)
The planner looks a little better now?  Maybe, maybe not.  Let me know.  (22/08/2018)
Fun fact:  the planner was designed in Microsoft Office in 2007!!!  Don't worry, I'm working on replacing it.  (10/08/2018)
Added scrollbars that look like the standard scrollbars (at the time) in Firefox for Ubuntu Gnome, which are the best looking scrollbars on earth (I didn't do it perfectly, but it's close).  These don't work on non-webkit browsers, which include Firefox and IE/Edge (I think).
Got rid of some of the stupid looking things I've done, more or less made it look a little better.
I have done lots of commenting, so now you can edit the code if wanted without having to find things in my messy code!  You're welcome!  (14/05/2018)
Customization has been added, so <em>Connexus Modern(ish) (2) and (3) are deleted.</em>  Please switch to Connexus Modern(ish) (the only one left!).
