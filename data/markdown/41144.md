### Description
A style I think I meddled with because I couldn't find it here anymore when I went to try and install it in Chrome.

Has a problem where when Wikipedia is displaying something like just the colors on the large chart on the article Web Colors it won't show them.

Also I have my Firefox set to expand the text two steps so that is the way I'm used to looking at this style.
