### Description
WARNING : This style is now OBSOLETE with the new version of Drupal's website.




Tries to improve slightly the usability...

Main changes :

- Bigger search areas (+ moved)
- Menus clearly separated
- Bigger breadcrumb
- Top menu reduced
- Some colors...

The *Ergo collection aims at improving usability without touching what makes the « soul » of websites. So no radical changes, website is still recognizable at first sight. You can find more *Ergo styles by clicking on my name up there.
