### Description
Makes the Kahoot! logo spin

### Update notes
<i>(pronounced kuh-spin, not cas-pin)</i>
This should work with all of the seasonal Kahoot! logo variations, especially if you have version 1.2.3 or above.

This is in the public domain, but credit is appreciated. Thanks!

Changelog:
1.2.3 — December 16th, 2019:
- Made the logo spin again
- Future-proofed the selector so it shouldn't break from site updates anymore
Note: The style now only targets the URLs it's supposed to work on in order to prevent the future-proofing from breaking other pages. This shouldn't affect anything unless they change the URLs I targeted in the future.

1.2.2 — November 19th, 2019:
(That's cute. I released 1.2 exactly one year ago today.)
- Restored Kahoot! v1 behavior (Kahoot! logo spins automatically again)
Note: Bringing back the new behavior isn't a high priority right now. Sorrrry.

<i>The following versions are very old and I do not have access to them anymore. I strongly recommend updating if you haven't already. With the release of 1.2.3, I am now archiving old versions of this style I have access to (1.2.2 and up) for historical purposes.</i>

1.2.1 — September 23rd, 2019:
- Fixed for Kahoot! v2
- Fixed the animation length and loop settings
Note: Unfortunately, due to Kahoot! v2, I can't make the logo spin unless the spinner appears first. I will be trying to fix this.

1.2 — November 19th, 2018
- Added support for the kahoot.it/join page (the page you go to after entering the Game PIN)

1.1 — November 14th, 2018
- Added animation speed and loop options

1.0 — November 7th, 2018
- Initial release
