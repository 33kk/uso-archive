### Description
Changes layout from fluid to static and includes the header graphic from homepage (you will need to manually change the image URL (or you can use your own.) A few other changes are present that I wanted (font family, font size, subscriber color) but you are free to remove or change to your own desire. Enjoy!

Changelog:
12/20/10 - Updated to increase font-size to reflect previous version's size. Also have the social (facebook + share icons) bar hidden by default.
6/10/10 - Added new Scene and cleaned up the stylesheet a bit to remove deprecated styles and so your homepage style selections are used.
6/05/10 - Adapted the stylesheet for Atlas Pro as all other styles have been removed.
1/25/10 - Changed some of the properties to remove extra (unneeded) lines as well as to differentiate my code from Browno's copy/pasta.


Neowin Scenes - This will override any selection you make on the homepage. Also, if you want to make your own scene, the values to use are 990x135.
