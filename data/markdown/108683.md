### Description
I created a Kitkat dark inspired holo theme for Google Apps some time ago, located <a href="http://www.mitchmenghi.com.au/2014/07/06/google-apps-stylish-theme-dark-holo-inspired/">here</a>, i really enjoyed working with it, it did come with some problems however eg, some setting screens are not styled 100%, if you add extensions i could break the theme if the extension was meant to work in a light theme.

Now that lollipop is out i was inspired to theme Google Apps again especially after seeing the new drive experience which was 100 times better than the old drive in terms of UI, hence this theme was born it will transform your Gmail theme into a very similar look to Drive to be more insync.
