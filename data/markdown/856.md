### Description
This is a stylesheet customizing Google Personalized Homepage.  This style is based on (style 489) and most of the code was originally writtin by user 376 , but I fixed a couple of errors and also changed the colors to some I liked better. 

Main Features: 

--- White background in the searchbox area of the page that fades into a light gray where the modules are.
--- Great looking modules with rounded corners and  dark blue headers that seem to be raised off the background a bit.
--- Module links with a soft green backlight when you hover over them.
--- New links are have solid arrow indicators beside them,
--- Visited links have a hollow arrow indicator and remain slightly grayed out unless you hover over them.
--- Added the search links for Groups, Froogle, & Books back to the top of the search box without having to click "more."


(Update 9/14/06)
---Just some minor changes to fix the module title color. Google added new "tabs" feature to Personalized Homepage and the new css caused the module titles to have 50% opacity, which rendered them nearly invisible. Now they are white and visible again.

(Update 9/27/06)
---Fixed the "more" links to place them horizontally again.
---Fixed problem with "Add content" and Google Account links overlapping.

(Update 9/30/06)
---Fixed problem with module title background color changing on extra tabs.

(Update 10/30/06)
---Forced account links to stay on one line.
---Changed module directory (where you add gadgets) background to white.
