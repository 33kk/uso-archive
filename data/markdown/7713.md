### Description
Provides a darker terminal setting for (www.)goosh.org without having to reset all your web page colors, and overriding the author's colors. The only problem I've found so far is that the author's email address is not visible in the heading credits, since I don't want to override all link colors -- just those which are not specified (the author's link colors work well on a black background)
