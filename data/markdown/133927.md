### Description
Here's a basic stylesheet to make 3DS Chaos a bit more clean.
I highly recommend you donate a few bucks to Chaos if you plan on using this since it does remove a couple of the UI elements dedicated to donations.

This is intended only for use while the "DARK STYLE" is turned on for the website.
You can switch to that by scrolling to the bottom of the page and choosing the style there.

-removes some donation boxes
-removes new roms sections because they are too bright
-fixes color of hide thanks tags
-disables annoying avatar spin code
-other misc layout fixes
