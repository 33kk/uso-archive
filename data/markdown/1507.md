### Description
Same as Jeuxvideo.TV, Jeuxvideo.com has its own gaminglive webpage.

Here there are the minors modifications :
 * Extended playlist to 100% of  its height
 * Removing Extra downloads for PSP or Ipod (because It's useless)
 * Made the page full sized and centered

Updated : Some tweaks are present in that new version.
 * Stylized panel of informations
 * Make high screens full centered (you'll see no differences in 1024 * 768 or less)
 * Playlists extended at maximum capacity

You can't really see effective modifications when looking at screens, try it in high resolution to see the differences.
