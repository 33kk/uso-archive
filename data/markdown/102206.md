### Description
Per request - the opposite of my other style, it gives you the blue bookmark stars used in the recent Firefox release even if you're using an older version, e.g. an ESR24 based release (ahem, Pale Moon, ahem...).
The unsorted bookmarks icon and the maintenance button in the bookmarks window aren't supported yet because they're still yellow in current Firefox itself - once blue versions of these are available, I'll incorporate them here.
