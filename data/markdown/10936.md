### Description
A collection of gmail styles and fixes.

Based off the following scripts:

* BurnOmania's Gmail style (http://userstyles.org/styles/5077)
* Fixed Navigation for Gmail (http://userstyles.org/styles/5481)
* Hide Invites (http://userstyles.org/styles/4724)

I am also running the following:

* RememberTheMilk for Gmail (http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/)
* Gmail Multi-Login (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/16341)
* Folders4Gmail (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8810)
* Quicklinks (Gmail labs)

I am not a professional coder. I've done my share of CSS work, but I can't promise I will be able to address specific issues or provide updates. I loved the original scripts listed above and wanted to be able to use them in conjunction, so I threw this style together, going in to fix the little conflicts that inevitably result. But because I am not a coder, I can't guarantee it will work in all computing environments. If you run into anything, or if you have any ideas or improvements, please comment! Thanks so much.
