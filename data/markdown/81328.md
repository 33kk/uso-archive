### Description
A new dark theme for updated (Jan 2013 "Bungie.next") version of Bungie.net. Makes the forums and various other pages easier on the eyes. Includes many subtle changes to give it a consistently high quality appearance, including some modified images and a lot of modified page elements.

### Update notes
*The white menu theme is currently broken.

Ready for download! Currently tested in Firefox 18.0 and Chrome 23.0.

This script was designed after seeing an overwhelming number of requests for a darker theme on the recently updated (as of Jan 2013) Bungie.net. This replaces many elements of the website to give it a dark theme which is much easier on the eyes than the current bright white. Pages affected include the forums, groups, search results, settings, profiles, news, and more. If you spot any glitches, flaws, or over-looked pages, please contact me on Bungie.net (my ID is Zoidberg25). When reporting problems, please include your browser type, and (optionally but preferably) browser version number and operating system. I'm also open to suggestions to improve the theme.

Have fun!
