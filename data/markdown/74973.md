### Description
Makes one of my favorite forums (and sites) more pleasing to the high-contrast eye.  Not everything works--if you click on the "photos" menu, for example, I haven't bothered with changing that particular background.  In particular, the navigation menu in all leaves much to be desired (for me). 

However, most importantly, the forums are pretty much done, including the post editor and such.
