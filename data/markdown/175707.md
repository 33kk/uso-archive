### Description
This is a pure CSS transliteration of names and agencies on the main trainee listing page for PRODUCE 101 Japan located at https://produce101.jp/profile/list.php

This is only for that specific page, and the ranking page as of version 1.0.0, and does not provide transliterations or translations for anything besides the traineesâ€™ names and agencies. To avoid confusion, I used the spellings on their profiles on this site.

This is built off of my previous themes for PRODUCE48 and PRODUCE X 101 which can be found here:
