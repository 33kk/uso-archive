### Description
A simple dark style for Google Keep. Includes support for the <a href="https://goo.gl/kYnUQE">Category Tabs</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/Cszd8e">Panel View</a> extensions. Feel free to use any of my code as long as you give credit.

Special thanks to user 280080 for inspiration from style 117673 and style 118959 (I recommend downloading them.)

### Update notes
Release notes:
<b>Coming soon</b> - a bunch of custom color options. Stay tuned.
v3.2 - Big update. Lots of optimization and new features.
v3.0 - More optimization and compatibility. Fixed the "non-bindable" elements that can't be styled normally.
v2.7 - Fixed a few bugs. <strike>Updated code sections that broke somehow.</strike>
v2.5 - Extension support is by default since it doesn't affect people who don't use the extensions.  Blocked the annoying reminder to turn on browser notifications. Repositioned the "offline" notification.
v2.0 - Added support for Firefox and Opera (hopefully, I haven't tested it.)
v1.5 - Generic fixes and improvements
v1.0 - Initial release. All basic functions working but it's not perfect

Feel free to leave any bugs, comments, or suggestions in the discussions. Feedback is the key to improvement.
