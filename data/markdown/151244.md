### Description
A dark, monochromatic theme for the celebrity gossip community, Oh No They Didn't, on Livejournal. Everything is easier to read, comments on posts are centered, and all user icons have been made circular. 

Note: It will load with the normal purple for the first time, but if you click on the ONTD logo again, it'll stay dark from there.
