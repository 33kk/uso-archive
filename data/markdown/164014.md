### Description
A simple cleanup style that removes the comment section, video rating, video thumbnails, and the recommended videos sidebar. The point of this cleanup is to let you focus on the video content instead of seeing clickbait thumbnails, a rowdy comment section, and other videos that you aren't interested in.
