### Description
This time without my typical lavender undertones, I bring you my new soundcloud style, written for and inspired by my buddy Kaffle. As is always the case, this style is meant to darken and clean the interface of soundcloud, please enjoy!

Some borders visible in the screenshots are officially removed for better appeal. Any discrepancies I notice in the future, such as the borders I fixed,  will be promptly changed.
