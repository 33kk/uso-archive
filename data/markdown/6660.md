### Description
White style for met-art.com and the UK MET-ART. This style makes readability very easy with vista's Calibri font, as well as the white styling.


Features:
- Calibri font (Supports Windows XP and Windows 9x by including "Arial" as
the secondary Font-Family if Calibri is not found.)
- White background
- White tables
- Wonderful light feel


Style's Idea:
-This style was suggested to me.  Please continue suggesting websites for me to style, I especially enjoy styling a dark website to white.

About:screenshot:
The screenshot's apparent whitespace missing area is accually a filtered image, not a problem with the style.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Code Cleanup & re-formatting code for readability
+ Shortened code by coding .com and .co.uk in one call
