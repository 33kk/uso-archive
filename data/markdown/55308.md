### Description
For use with "Custom OneeChan" color scheme option in style 56312. Default options below represent the "Tomorrow" color scheme.


ALWAYS make sure Custom AppChan is enabled AFTER AppChan to override the style. If you reinstall AppChan, disable and re-enable Custom AppChan.

Everything is labelled for you in the style. Play around with settings, use a site like palettebuilder.com to find a nice color scheme from one color.
Do not delete sections in the style. This will not remove what you want, but rather make it uncustomizable from here. Add "display: none !important;" to the section in the source instead to remove things. To uncomment something (i.e, for transparent replies, background image, or custom scrollbars) remove the slashes and stars.

### Update notes
Notes:

Any additional tweaks not in this style can be added in to override AppChan without touching your AppChan installation. To find selectors for additional tweaks, right click the element and click "Inspect Element" (Firefox users need Firebug extension). Classes are preceeded by . (.class) and ids are preceeded by # (#id).

See relevant sections in source for background images, transparent reply option customization, and custom scrollbars.

To make the background color of something transparent rather than colored, find the relevant section in the source and replace "#numbers" with "transparent".

Install info:
