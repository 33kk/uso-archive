### Description
A dark theme featuring classic Yahoo! purple to compliment cool shades of blue and grey.  This style works with most Yahoo! domains.  I tried to keep this simple and fast, so no replacement images or base64 are in this script.  

***UPDATE!***  I found this script also works with The Huffington Post.  It isn't seamless, but the layout is similar enough that I really like how this works.  If you prefer to keep your old install of Yahoo! Cool Dark Purp, just add [domain("huffingtonpost.com"),]  to the list below @-moz-document.
