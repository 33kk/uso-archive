### Description
Reverses the eval and section toolbars, and makes the section toolbar buttons look like tabs when selected.
I am aware of the inconsistency in px/pt units and will fix it in the next update.

Changelog

• 0.0.1 Last unlabeled release

@ user 13832 - I have been using this style for quite some time and posted it when I saw yours under New App Styles, to show how I attempted to solve the active tab problem.
