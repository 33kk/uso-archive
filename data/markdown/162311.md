### Description
Reclaim wasted whitespace for content:

- Remove right-side "In this article"
- make page use the entire browser window for content.

Bonus: the comments, that nobody was ever allowed to add, is going away. Removed the notification that they're going away, and removed the place to enter new comments that cannot be used to add new comments.
