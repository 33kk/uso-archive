### Description
resizesearchbox is a great extension found at <http://dragtotab.mozdev.org/resizesearchbox/> that allows the user to dynamically change the size of the searchbox with the mouse.  the extension predates the surge of rounded border themes, so the drag element is caught between the left image and the rest of the searchbox, messing up the look of the box.  this script puts an arrow pointing left instead of the separator image and inherits the parent borders.  Note: the width property may need adjusted per theme
