### Description
THIS...IS... err... FEEDLY! But unlike you've ever seen it!

Forget Google Reader, and all other programs trying to imitate it. This is new. Different. Better. This is the Pinterest of RSS readers. It's Full HD (1920x1080 with no space gone wasted), but also works (and improves Feedly) in lower res monitors as well. It's compact, dynamic, intuitive, smart. It's simply better than anything you ever saw, in any RSS reader.

This is F.E.E.D.

And it's free. 

You're welcome :-)
