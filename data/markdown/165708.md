### Description
Google really messed up when it came to the design of their web browser. All those shadows and borders make it look absolutely dated.

Google Roundify takes the Google search engine and makes it look like it's strait out of 2019. With the removal of unnecessary lines and shadows, this style really brings out the minimalism of Google.
