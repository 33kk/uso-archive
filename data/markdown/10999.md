### Description
This is a quick fix for a sloppy programming mistake in the about.com forums. In message threads, if viewed on Firefox 3, the cryptic message

h2 {font-size: 10pt !important;}

turns up in the top area just before the actual thread title. A sloppy programmer has tried to insert a style tag at this point where it doesn't belong at all (its place, if used at all, is in the head area of the page, not the body) , and FF 3 displays it as text, ignoring the tag. The fix makes style tags invisible (as they should be).
