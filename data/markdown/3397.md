### Description
This style modifies some CBS Sportsline (mostly American sports) pages so you can open them in the sidebar - NFL, NCAA Football, NBA, NCAA Basketball, MLB.  When games are being played the pages refresh every couple of minutes or so.  Includes an example for highlighting your favorite team.

To use this you will need to create a bookmark to (for example)

http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/box-scoreboards

Right click on the bookmark and check the "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" box.

Also works with:

http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/box-scoreboards
http://www.cbssports.com/nba/box-scoreboards
http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/box-scoreboards
http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/box-scoreboards

Let me know if you find any similar pages and I'll add them.

If you don't want the Recap, Scoreboard and Gametracker links add .nav to the {display:none} list.
