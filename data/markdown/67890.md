### Description
This style comes with two parts, see below the pick which one you want to use (or both!).

Rightside Options is pretty self-explanatory - it moves the post options to the right, so that page stretching will be easy for you to fix (as long as it happens to you!)

Forum Crop limits the width of threads so that the page will never stretch no matter what! However, it might not display perfectly for everyone.
