### Description
Replaces Firefox 3's Go Button for a New one with a border.
This button appears when you begin to type an address into the Awesome Bar.

** Idea and partial selectors code came from user 7273's wonderful style, named style 6584.  Thanks!

Features:
+ Displays a box around the GoButton.  Now it is even easier to click and to see.
+ Increased navigation on Firefox.
+ Great for those used to Firefox 2


Browser Versions:
+ Works on Firefox3
+ Works on Firefox 3 FINAL

Integrates with Style 8261.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
- Removed code to always show the go button.  
+ Now can fully integrate with my other style
