### Description
Speed Dial Add-On for Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/speed-dial/

This style makes the panels more transparent.
Furthermore you may use preview images with alpha channel now, it won't add a background anymore.

There's an option within the extension itself to hide empty slots, but i didn't want them to be completely invisible.


You can change the color of the title by changing the values in the first block of code.
