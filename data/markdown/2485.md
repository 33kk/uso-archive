### Description
Pages with white backgrounds tend to hurt my eyes, so I made this grey-and-blue-on-black theme.

Most of the formating was done with pictures, which have been replaces with CSS borders and such, so the look is a bit different, but it renders fewer images, so it seems to render faster.

A few hard-to-convert pieces were removed, but they aren't that necessary anyway. One image (the vote buttons) is included in the CSS to convert that (the existing white anti-aliased buttons look bad in the black background), and I hope they work property for everybody.

Comment boxes still have yet to be converted - the custom colors allowed there may make that hard.

This is a work in progress - input is appreciated, as CSS is not exactly my specialty.
