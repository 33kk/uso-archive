### Description
For news on updates, or other themes that I make, then please follow me http://twitter.com/hljames
This is also to be used with http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/64641

I am basing this on the Command Line found in Windows, for SSH access to servers.. but why not the look for Twitter?

UPDATE #1: Now you can see your previous tweet, with highlighting.
UPDATE #2: Now the promotion is gone, do you see ads on a Command Line anyways?
UPDATE #3: Twitter's logo now looks like more like a command line, I also kept "twt" in the logo blue to reference Twitter more.
UPDATE #3-1: Now the new logo is clickable, the next update should fix the buttons.
