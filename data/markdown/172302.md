### Description
Makes theater mode occupy whole window. Supports hiding or shrinking of scrollbar. Requires Iridium addon/userscript. <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/172319/youtube-big-theater-cinema-mode">Here's the version that doesn't require it.</a> Only for the material (aka new) design of YouTube.

### Update notes
The top bar is shown when you place the mouse within 14 pixels of the top of the page. This ensures you can click poll / recommended videos icon - something other theater extenders I've tried can't do.
I've mitigated some effects of the style on non-theater mode, but not all, due to limitations of CSS.
Thin scrollbar is currently only supported by Chrome and newer versions of FireFox. Thin scrollbar color is only configurable in Chrome.
Iridium is an addon that fixes a ton of problems on YouTube (it's also available as a userscript, which is what I prefer). A page class that I'm using in this style is added by the addon.

Revision 2 - there was an invisible, but clickable hint area, it was a YouTube bug.
