### Description
Adds reddish highlighting for  Google search results with "This site may harm your computer.".   Firefox itself should prevent you from accessing such sites identified by  stopbadware.org as both Mozilla, Google,  and several others are partners.

The highlighting will help you avoid clicking on the site.

Even though Firefox uses the same data, there will be timing differences between what is available from Google servers and what Mozilla has downloaded to you for your protection.
