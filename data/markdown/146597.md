### Description
I don't mind seeing Twitter ads, but they tend to look very similar to normal content.
This style fixes that by giving them a different (configurable) background colour.

### Update notes
2017-08-14: The style now also affects promoted accounts (without hover effect to match Twitter's default behaviour).
2017-08-14: Fixed bug causing descendants of promoted tweets to be coloured in too.
2017-10-13: The style now also affects promoted trends.
