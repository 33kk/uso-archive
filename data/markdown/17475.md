### Description
gabumon codes for gamefox

what you have to do is download firefox and then get gamefox. open up notepad and put in this code and then save it 'digimon' or w/e(i'll post it on the end of this message) then go to

tools > gamefox > style > import stylesheet

and then open up the digimon file.

you can go to

http://userstyles.org/styles/17469

and click "show code" to get up to 493 (so you don't have to put them all in) instead of just 5. i only did 5 so just keep copying and pasting the URL for what images for which post number.
