### Description
With the removal of Cosmic Panda, Youtube's video player was, in my opinion, pure crap. 
So i came up with this User Style to tweak it a bit and make it look better. It works perfect on a 1280x720 screen resolution on Firefox, but i'm working on doing the same with other browsers and resolution.

This is useful if, for example, you're watching a video that isn't 16:9 but a wider format, because the width of the video will adjust to your screen.
It's also great if you, like me, like to zoom in the whole website.

This other stlye: style 58170 is just to remove the playlist/favorite bar from the bottom. Believe me, you don't want that with this style.
