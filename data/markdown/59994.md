### Description
by <a href="/users/131844?per_page=50">grom</a>. Works in 2014, best on Firefox.

- subtle colored stripe indicates subforum you are reading;
- external links posted by users are clearly marked; dangerous external links are marked in red;
- lesser nesting of replies in the forums;
- signatures separated from comments by a dashed border;
- comments now have max-width, making it hard for them to break website's layout. Cool, huh. ;)

This is a <strong>layout style</strong>, it doesn't change colors.
