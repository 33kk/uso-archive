### Description
This is a very detailed rebuild of the look&feel of Google for the results-page of Scroogle SSL-encrypted search.

It tries to mime the look of the google searchresults-page so that people using Scroogle do not have to readept to another search-engine.

Also check out my favicon-userstyle (http://userstyles.org/styles/9574) which will replace the rather ugly Scroogle-Favicon in your browser with the classy old Google-Favicon.

And finally, to get the ultimate Google-feel for Scroogle, install my modded Scroogle-searchengine plugin for Mozilla/Firefox/Seamonkey at http://www.css-petals.net/templates/scroogle-installer/index.html.
It offers ssl-encrypted search, the Google-favicon also in the search-bar and a reduction to 20 results via Scroogle.

Remember that this style is only intended for the Scroogle-results page and could possibly screw up other layout-parts of the ssl-website of Scroogle!

Update 20080819:
The new version fixes some small bugs and - most -significantly - moves Scroogle's lower search-form to the top on top of the regular search form. This way, you have the radio-buttons for more results right where you need them. See the new "After"-Screenshot below for a more graphic explanation of the new version of this style.
