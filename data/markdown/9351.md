### Description
Turns Major Geeks look in to something a little more bland and easier to read. (for those who like "light" themes)

Features:

* Light Background
* Dark Text
* Blue Links, Purple for visited, On hover they are 'Underlined'
* Most Advertisements are hidden.

Because Major Geeks is devoid of CSS It makes styling a little more complected, It is still possible to style some parts of a page using XPaths e.g. hiding an advertisement "body>div>table>tbody>tr>td>table>tbody>tr>td>center>center>center>center>a>img". You can find the XPaths by using DOM Inspector or Firebug.
