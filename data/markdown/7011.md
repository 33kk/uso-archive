### Description
Dark Carbon Theme for Yamour! Video downloader or All-In-One Video Bookmarklet page...

Not really sure if one ever think about how to download the video in Youtube, Metacafe, Myspace, Break.com, Putfile...etc. Using this bookmarklet one can download those video.

For more infos and to download this bookmarklet  can found here:-

Bare in mind you need those bookmarklet to use this style. I created this style specially to use with Yamour! but one also can use the All-In-One (2nd link) and it will change the images/background in  the download page...

Credits: Icons/Logo are created using Gimp...thank you :)
