### Description
A Bare Remember The Milk, designed to be displayed and not interacted with.

It's very simple, very messy, and almost what I had in mind. I'd like it to fill the whole screen, but I couldn't figure out how, so I gave up and used the browser to zoom in to the page. It is an inelegant and slap-dash script, but it works perfectly for my needs and doesn't break any of Remember The Milk's syncing or auto-update stuff, so I'm happy with it.
