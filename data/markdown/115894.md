### Description
An updated version of Lights Out, a dark theme for Youtube.

This style changes your Youtube experience into a dark, minimalist and simplistic style with a larger-sized theatre mode video player. Designed to be easy on the eyes and provide just enough magic to make your viewing experience a little better.
