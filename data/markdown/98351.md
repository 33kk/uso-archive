### Description
I've always wanted Trello to be this way. I believe this theme will be helpful for people who manage lot of boards, lists and cards. This theme allows you to quickly switch between boards and offers maximum space utilization through sleek cards. Feel free to customize as you see fit. While this theme may not suit your specific needs, if you do have a similar preference like mine, I hope you can use it as a base to work upon.
