### Description
this style is a remastered and improved style from the <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/164265>Stylus Theme (Dark)</a>. 
muchas gracias for <a href=https://userstyles.org/users/632009>Randy W. Sims</a>, an author of it, for his huge work, which help us to save our eyes from the ruinous light. 

Come to the Dark Side

this style goes well with the darcula theme of the editor, imho. 
but feel free with your own experiments.
