### Description
Works on Chrome and Firefox AFAIK. 
Little testing but if anything doesn't work right for you or you edit the style so that others would like, leave a comment.
 A clean dark theme that makes it less distracting and easier to focus on the juicy content!
No Ads, less clutter, more time to just enjoy!
