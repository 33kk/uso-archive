### Description
Google's Hangouts app at hangouts.google.com shows images for emoji instead of utf-8 text emoji. This means that they can force you to use Google's emoji style, which most people hate. 

This script disables the image emoji and shows the text emoji instead. If you have a proper emoji supporting font installed, you will see that font's emoji instead. In the screenshot, the Twemoji font is pictured.

Only tested on hangouts.google.com, but you might get it to work on other hangouts supporting sites.
