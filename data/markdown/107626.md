### Description
An angel-banishing sigil for the icon bar. Choose which button it replaces in the options. <b>This version allows installation on multiple buttons simultaneously.</b>

### Update notes
<b>January 2016</b> - Fixed the dropdown button, hopefully. Don't have time to test on anything other than Firefox 32.

<b>November 11, 2015</b> - Should now function with the new chat bubble button.

<b>April 27, 2015</b> - Realized it accidentally hid the ask options on the horrid user card on icon hover. Only even re-enabled those because xkit stopped working properly for on-dash ask boxes. Since nobody else reported that issue, I'm going to assume most of us have been killing the new menu, too. For those who haven't been, I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience! It should now be fixed.

<b>April 2015 Update</b> - Added an option for the activity button.

<b>December 2014 Update</b> - Since I anticipate XKit may put the buttons back where they belong and offer an option to undo this ridiculous drop-down button change, I'm not removing those options. However, if you choose buttons that aren't actually available for view, this won't magically make them show up. Choose 'drop down' to use this on the new dropdown button.

If you're looking for one to over the xkit logo, <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/103531/tumblr-xkit-icon-angel-banishing-sigil-spn">try this instead</a>. I maintain them separately, as tumblr and xkit are subject to independent changes. And if you only want a single button to be the sigil, head on over to <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/103532">this version</a> which has a simpler set of installation optinos.
