### Description
If you are not logged in to Twitter you may notice a log-in sign-up dialogue in the middle of the screen, furthermore a blackout overlay surrounds the log-in (sign-up) so you can't see the content unless you close it. This style removes that log-in sign-up prompt along with the blackout.
