### Description
A dark and elegant theme for IxQuick.com.

### Update notes
The style works only with the "air" theme. Make sure to use this theme in IxQuick preferences.
Some pages like configuration/FAQ are excluded from the theme. By default it hides ads, but you can also just make them obvious by choosing "No" to the question "Hide Ads?" upthere in this window.

Thanks to there.is.only.xul from freenode #firefox who helped me to understand Stylish and its mechanisms, and thanks to bionx (the author of "ixquick clean & minimal" theme) whose code helped me to understand how to replace some elements.
