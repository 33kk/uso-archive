### Description
Todoist - Special Dark Good Organization for All

### Update notes
16-August-2020
* Fix and changes, because of the scroll bar in the middle, which made it movable, 
  and then it didn't look right.
  Now it looks good.
* Rounds of improved colors, with brighter edges, and more beautiful. They look better. 
  When there are priorities. But without drawing too much attention. That they do not distract
  the view or the attention.
* THE MIDDLE BAR, you have to move it COMPLETELY TO THE RIGHT.
  The two arrows, which come out for the mobility of the bar, are actually more or less
  in the middle of the menu on the left, and you have to look for them, because they are invisible.
  And put said invisible, movable bar to the right, to the maximum.
* But right now, to see it properly, you have to use the 67% or 75% zoom in the web browser,
  and also, the screen has to be at a resolution of 1920x1080.
  This way, if it looks good.
* There are some more things to fix, but for now it is workable,
  And it works fine. But like I said, it has to be at this screen resolution, and at this zoom.

23-May-2020
* For a correct visualization, at the moment put in the browser a zoom of 67%.

* Works perfectly with the 67% Zoom of the web browser (verified in Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge).

* Made a Fix, which needed to be modified, for the new version of todoist.

* The possibility of putting background to words in the left part of the screen, at this moment is deactivated, because todoist, in its new version, does not allow to put bold, nor italic, in the left part of the screen. (We hope that the company todoist, reactivate the bold and italics in the names of the projects. If we ask many people by email, they will also activate it again in bold and italics in the name of the projects, in the left part of the screen). (In addition, Todoist has shortened the length of the phrase, from the name of the projects on the left side of the screen).


17-March-2019
Very Important: For it to be displayed correctly, it has to change in configuration, to the DARK Theme.

Of the right part, that is, of the Tasks: 5 background colors and new line. (It can also be applied in the comments).
(New line That is, you can write paragraphs, with a new line, as many times as you want, to make the tasks more clear).
* Background colors:
`accent to the left, yellow background color, black letters`
_with an underlined, green background color, yellow italic letters_
__ with two underlined, pink background color, white letters__

* More colors: underlined and accent to the left.
_`with an underlined and accent to left, orange background color, yellow letters`_   (It also makes new line).
__`with two underlined and accent to left, blue background color, yellow letters`__

* New line.
_` `_ 
That is, underlined, accent to the left, space, accent to the left, and underlined.  


Of the left part, that is, of the Projects.
_with an underlined, yellow background color, black letters_
__ with two underlined, red background color, yellow letters__

* With Ctrl, expand the letter and Ctrl- decrease the letter.
* But keep in mind that at the same time, it also changes colors and backgrounds.
* And at the same time it is also responsive.

* bigger emojis. 
(You can copy and paste the emojis from web pages of emojis, and they are displayed larger, so you can see them better).

Improve the visualization of the dates of the tasks as they get closer:
* date overdue (red background, and the letters change color but it reads well).
* Today (green background, and the letters change color but it reads well).
* Tomorrow (blue background, and the letters change color but it reads well).
* the next 7 days (orange background, and black letters).
* Later dates, black background, white letters.

16-Nov-2018
* Added 3 background colors and color of the letter, as if highlighted by fluorescent marker.
And also changes the color of the letter according to the responsive zoom, so that it does not bother the reader's eyes.
Ideal for long project titles, and highlight words with fluorescent reticle, and larger emojis:

a) Use the French accent, it works in the menu on the right:
`with French accent to left wing, a yellow background color`

a) Use 1 or 2 underlines, in the menu on the left and right:
_with an underlined green background color_
__ with two underlined red background color__


5-Nov-2018
* Responsive Zoom Crtl+ and Ctrl-
* Change color word with Zoom Crtl+ and Crtl-
* Big Emojis.
* Color Background words 
*And other Fix.

22-Oct-2018
* Changed the color of the dates that appear to the right of the task, and much more highlighted. They offer clarity of visualization.

20-Oct-2018
* Project selection box in the column on the left.
* Expanded the display width (more characters per line), left column and right column.

28-Jul-2018
 Line of the left of projects longer, and line of the right of longer tasks,
Especially the line on the left, because I use many projects whose name consists of several lines, and with a longer line looks much better.

18-Jul-2018 
__`Words black, and background white`__
That is, with two underscores in front and accent to the left.

18-Jul-2018 
Left Only Accent French `words green bold and yellow background`.
That is, enclose between French accent on the left, instead of in quotes.
Yes= `abcd` , No = "abcd".
