### Description
This will brings the MyFonts webpage back down to a 760px maximum width. It accomplishes this fairly easily, and moves a few elements around in order to accommodate. The search box is moved up above the tab links, and the font preview controls are double-height now instead of in one long band.

Includes an optional feature to remove the font slideshow (which the screenshots show), letting you get straight to the point instead of having to scroll past all that JavaScript wanking to even see the font.
