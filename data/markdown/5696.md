### Description
Yeah... 
I'm not having my own blog where I post embedded links to Youtube videos and doesn't do it on Myspace either.
So the Embed box on Youtube just take up space in my case.

I'm no expert in writing these scripts at all, I just found the function in this script: style 4264 by user 667 . But I couldn't use the rest of the features the script provides, and I couldn't find a script which just did what this one does, so I made it myself.
