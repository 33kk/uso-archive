### Description
The new Meet pane in the Gmail sidebar takes up a lot of space, making the Chat underneath barely usable under some circumstances. The functionality of the pane (to start or join a meeting) is also available elsewhere. This hides the pane to go back to how the sidebar looked before it was introduced.
