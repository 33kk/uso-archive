### Description
This alters the GMail, YouTube, Google Docs, Google Calender, and all other Google login screens, and makes them look like Google Search, (see picture entitled "Image with the style") without limiting the functionality. Logically, the left side of the search bar is for your username, and the right for your password. As soon as you click the box, the two sides become obvious, so it's not confusing (as in the main picture).

Google don't put the topbar on their login screens, so it is just for show, and doesn't actually work as it usually does. The topbar links to the 'Forgot your Password' page.

This doesn't remove adverts or anything else; it only edits the login screen.
