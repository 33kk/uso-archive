### Description
xmlsoft.org (along with libxml2 documentation) is a really ancient website, very inconvenient to view. This style tries to ease the look a bit, so you won't have eye cancer after a hour. Because xmlsoft.org uses no classes and only tables for design, the capabilities to make a good style are rather restricted, so I wasn't able to do more than a few basic things.
Enjoy nevertheless!
