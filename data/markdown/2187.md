### Description
Global style forcing given colour scheme.

Features (shows/reveals) :
- does not affect anything but colours (preserves layout)
- disables background images -- this is intended feature, not a bug. Many designs cannot stand this, but it is not flaw of this userstyle but a flaw of concrete designs. No information should be represented _only_ as a background-image.
- some basic semantics (headings, navigation, emphasizes, etc.)
- visited / unvisited links
- some IMO neat form styling effects.
