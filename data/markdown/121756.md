### Description
If you know the element ID, you can append it as a hash tag to the URL to go to that element directly,

<pre>https://userstyles.org/help/coding#<b>help-style-settings</b></pre>

takes you to 

<pre>&lt;h2 id="<b>help-style-settings</b>"&gt;</pre>

This style shows you the IDs of the headings in Userstyles help pages which have them. Hover over the heading to see the hash tag.

They're displayed as pseudo-elements, so you can't copy+paste them, but it's better than a poke in the eye.
