### Description
Tumblr 'new post' icons for your dashboard.

"<i>Cornify started as a spoof of internet companies that are based around a single feature (specifically addthis.com) and receive millions of dollars in investment. The goal was to come up with the most ridiculous single-feature web company, which ended up being a web service for adding cheesy, glittery unicorns and rainbow graphics to any website.</i>" <sup><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cornify">*</a></sup>
