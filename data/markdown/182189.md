### Description
A Dark Blue colored theme with a blurred background image (default to an anime one).
Works best on Roblox's dark theme setting

### Update notes
Idk how to do settings, but to change background picture, just scroll down in CSS and in #fb-root you can see where to change it.
If I missed any bits to color please notify me.

Version list:
1.0.0-2020/04/09: Initial release
1.0.1-2020/04/10: Added colors to some uncolored parts of theme
1.1.0-2020/04/12: Made most backgrounds transparent and added color to developer related pages.
1.1.1-2020/05/01: Colored some unnoticed parts of the site and adjusted some other colors for better contrast.
1.2.0-2020/05/20: Added support for Roblox's white theme setting (basically no matter the theme setting you have on roblox, this theme will look mostly the same). Note that on white theme the icons are dark, therefore i suggest using dark theme. Also colored some leftover parts.
1.2.1-2020/07/21: Colored some parts of site that weren't colored before
1.2.2-2020/08/27: Another coloring "fix" (2020/09/13 - same thing)
