### Description
Just a personal touch from someone who only ever browses blenderartists.org on the desktop. Basically this will get rid of the white space. Should work with both the dark and the light theme as it is/was just after the migration to discourse. People from the future: YMMV.

### Update notes
v0.0.3 - fixes onebox thumbnails.
