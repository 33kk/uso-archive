### Description
This style makes Update Notifier a little less noticeable when it has nothing to tell you. I have removed the dropdown marker and adjusted the margins as well. This is mainly intended for those who have it placed next to their throbber, like in my screenshot.

Updates:

Jul 26 2009 - Fixed an issue with the way FF 3.5 handles opacity. Not sure if this works on 3 now, if not just add "moz-" before opacity and it should work.
