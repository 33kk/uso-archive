### Description
Twitter semi-glass ala my previous styles. I'll probably update this whenever I figure out something breaks.

Preferable that you use White Overlay + a dark(er) link color as to prevent visibility issues.


Please credit (just a linkback is fine!) if you base your code off any of this.

My twitter: mugeca

Feel free to ask questions or bug me if something breaks. Can't guarantee I will be able to fix it right away, but I'll try to get to it ASAP.

### Update notes
To do:
>custom icons to eliminate that clunky and dorky border (might be hard because of the way twitter uses background color to give the icons their color)
>actually look at the media gallery function and apply the style there.
