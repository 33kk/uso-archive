### Description
This script is the result of an experiment to see how many context-menu items I could remove from firefox without causing myself any inconvenience. Amazingly, almost all of them turned out to be expendable. The biggest surprise was the New Window command, but frankly I don't miss it at all. Most of the time, opening a new tab is perfectly sufficient; and if not, it is just as easy to copy the link's URL and open a new blank window with ctrl-N instead.

Everything else -- navigation, bookmarking, websearch -- turned out to be unnecessary shortcuts for commands more logically located elsewhere in the browser. Now, there is no chance of accidentally clicking "Send Link..." and waiting angrily for the email client to open just so it can be closed.

If you want a particular menu-item back, just find the source-line which corresponds to that item and paste this text in front of it: /*KEEP:

Good luck readjusting your right-click expectations!
