### Description
##### PLEASE READ ######
Chart colors wont change via CSS code, you need to click on preferences (gear icon above chart) yourselves and change chart background, candle colors etc yourselves! Sorry! In future I will provide hex values for the colors I use in the screenshot, so you can try to match best you can with their stupid color picker. Sorry but it's out of my control!

TradeTheTrend-sponsored dark theme to improve the look and feel of TradingView. This is a minimal design: many share features have been removed from the charting page.
