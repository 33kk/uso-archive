### Description
So I had <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/64011/2do-like-style-for-toodledo">another style for Toodledo that I had made based on the old 2Do interface</a>. 2Do is an iOS, Android, and Mac OS app that syncs with Toodledo. It used to have a skeuomorphic interface based on natural elements like wood, leather, and cloth. Now it's gone all minimal just like everything in the Mac world. Sigh. But anyway, just so that I can get my Toodledo experience feeling a bit consistent, I've created a new style that uses some of the schemes of the new 2Do. Note that you might have to download and install a font on your computer for this to work fully. See the Additional Info section below.
