### Description
A style for PhysicsOverflow with flat design, and a modern font (Segoe UI) incredibly similar (but better than) to Microsoft's modern font set. The great thing about this style is the editor, which is restyled greatly. If you don't like the font, but like the flat design, then enter "Helvetica, Arial" (without quotes) for the font option.
