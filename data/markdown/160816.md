### Description
A compact list view of the GoCD dashboard.  Horizontal rows are created from the dashboard tiles.  Additionally, material list views are greatly expanded allowing for easier viewing of complex material lists and the agents page column widths have been optimized for maximum view-ability.

Currently set to apply to URLs beginning with goserver or on the gocd.org domain.  You will likely have to add your own URL prefix, regexp or domain for this to work with your specific installation.

*Inspired by elmundio87's 'Thoughtworks GO Vertical Remix' style that hasn't been updated since February 20, 2013.
