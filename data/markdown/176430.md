### Description
For Polish users of o2 mail. Based on the Gmail Dark theme. Created for personal purposes, but thought about sharing. Not a complete dark mode conversion, settings remain white, attachments as for now are a bit broken, and jump to date is a little ugly. The CSS contains a few residue obfuscated classes from testing, need to clean them up. Updates will come. 

Obviously it's all very very very hacky. 

Naturally, the composer and mail view still have a white background due to the fact that it would be unnatural to display e-mail contents designed to have black text on a dark background. It's a philosophical issue more than anything, but I will be working on it. Maybe as an alternative in style settings.
