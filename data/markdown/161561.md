### Description
When you're mining cryptocurrency in the dark, your eyes are accustomed to it, so opening bright sites makes you blind. This little style helps your eyes be healthy while checking prices of your favourite coins on CoinMarketCap :)

PS. Remember to disable default, ugly dark theme on site!
