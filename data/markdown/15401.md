### Description
This userstyle highlights selected input-fields and textareas like Safari does.


If you don't like the highlighting of selected buttons, change
input:not([type="checkbox"]):not([type="radio"]):focus,
to
input:not([type="submit"]):not([type="reset"]):not([type="button"]):not([type="checkbox"]):not([type="radio"]):focus,
(don't forget the comma at the end!)

Update (13th Mar 2009):
-Bugfix: Some input-fields were still cut off

Update (8th Mar 2009):
-Bugfix: Some input-fields were cut off
-Code cleanup


Note: If you use Firefox 3.5 or above you might prefer the Firefox 3.5+ version of this userstyle,
because this version takes advantage of -moz-box-shadow which creates the same effect,
but causes less flaws on some websites:
