### Description
"Just Hotmail Thank You", is for people who don't want to see anything but Hotmail when go to check their email..no promotional links to other services like Calendar, Spaces, Live Search nor links to sponsors or advertisers nor splash pages about "Today".  This style is as simple a style as they come, a just couple lines of CSS code to hide the half a dozen or so elements that aren't part of actual Hotmail functionality.  Hides:

A - "Windows Live" header which upon mouse over displays a long list to the myriad of other MSN servers
B - "Ad Banner Header"
C - "Live Search textbox" + buttons to "Spaces" and other arbitrary services
D - Shortcuts to "Today" and "Calendar" near the "Contacts"
E - "Ad Module"
F - "Switch to Classic" promo text box

Don't forget to go into "Hotmail > Options > Today page settings" and set it to "Skip the Today page and take me straight to my inbox" which tells Hotmail to drop you right into your messages when you login.

Also, if you like this little style....please post a userstyles.org review if you get a chance, thanks.   Check out my similar style 9809
