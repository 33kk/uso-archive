### Description
** BROKEN!! INSTALL ALTERNATIVE SCRIPT **

Google updated their code, broke this style. I have another script, written in JavaScript, that's much more reliable than this one is, and ever could be. I could update this style, but I don't see a need to do so since it's so easy to break it...

^^This^^ script add the Google bar on several Google pages. You can adjust the color, the links, and the bar position. In the future, I'll add even more options.
