### Description
The student site of New Bulgarian University looks like a total crap.
It seems that it is just another "Designed for IE" website :D

Well, boo IE, I'm using FF with this userstyle and it looks as it should be :)

ChangeLog:

04.03.2010 ->
  1. Fixed submenu position, added border submenu to make it more visible.
  2. Made submenu items whitespace clickable.
