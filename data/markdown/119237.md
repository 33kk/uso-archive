### Description
The Agile Mail Update - Now in 3D!

This style has updates to better utilize screen real estate. Make sure you switch into threaded view (the button just to the left of the refresh wheel), the threaded view of notes is compressed to the practical minimum. The folder listing is shrunk allowing many more names to be shown.

The inbox listing is colored so unread, read, important, meetings, selected is very apparent, as they are intermingled.

This style is using close to the base color set with very similar settings to 'IBM Verse - Inbox Enhancements' by RSCHOON, and has no 3D elements.

Overrides: the 'px' and '%' suffixes need to be there, don't remove them!

### Update notes
Important disclaimer: This extension is NOT supported by IBM. Any issue must be sent to myself only (do not open a PMR).

This extension is provided AS IS.
