### Description
The user commentary on The Daily Beast's Cheat Sheet is dominated by a vocal minority of partisan vitriol, most of which is posted by a few users that seem to always be able to get the "first post".

This hides the "Comments" link on each story so you won't be drawn into the drivel of the great unwashed.
