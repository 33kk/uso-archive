### Description
The Back, Forward, and Dropmarker buttons are misplaced in certain themes, causing obvious artifacts.
This Fixes the buttons in those themes.

*** May be specific to PitchDark theme. Regardless, this fixes the problem for now and the problem may be fixed in the next version of the PitchDark theme. If anyone would like to confirm whether this is specific to that theme or not, please do.

I got help for making this style by looking at style 7325 by user 4360. After looking at that style again in the default theme for Firefox 3.0.1 on Ubuntu it appears broken(as does this one with the default theme). I therefore assume that one or both of us designed our styles for specific themes, or they just don't work with "Classic" Firefox themes. I would like someone to confirm this as well. Thanks, and hope it helps you. ^.^ ***

Update: It appears that the reason it doesn't work on the default theme is because it is a "Classic" theme(doesn't include the large circular button like other themes).
