### Description
This style shrinks the Addonbar to a smaller size and pushes it in one of the lower corners, like proposed in several mockups. http://jboriss.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/removing-firefox%E2%80%99s-status-bar-and-rehousing-add-on-icons-part-3-of-2-wut/

A few customizable options are available:
 -Choose if the bar should be on the left or the right side.
 -Turn the bar 60% transparent, when the mouse doesn't hover above it.
 -Slide the bar into the side or the bottom, when not hovered.
 -Choose if the bar should have a shadow or borders.

The Findbar has also been deattached as a floating section.

Tested on FF4.0

Works with personas.

### Update notes
Issues:
-Sadly I had to deattach the Findbar, as it made trouble in conjunction with new features and it became seemingly impossible to keep around the rest of the Addonbar.
-I implemented a 0.5s delay before the bar slides back into the bottom, in case the mouse leaves the bar area for a moment by mistake. I would gladly implement this behavior into the side-slide feature too, but the width:auto; statement makes this impossible by using transitions, as auto as a size-statement isn't supported.
-The persona-background picture isn't positioned right in the Findbar, when positioned on the right side. This would have required setting the right offset-pixelcount by hand, which isn't possible, as too many personas are less than 3000px(standard)
 wide. so I set the offset to 78%, which is about right for standard-conform personas and should yield a decent result for any other.
