### Description
i have edited this code, which was posted by anorin to get the following . 
1- Styled tabs "half rounded"
2- Tabs on top while keeping the transperancy 
3- nomore shadow around the font inside tabs
4- cleaner status-bar area with no dividers or borders
5- some little tweaks..find for yourself :D 

---- 
as with anorin code.. 
this works only on win 7 and vista  
it wouldnt look as it's meant to be on XP,Mac and linux .
