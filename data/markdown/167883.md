### Description
This is almost a complete remake 2.0 of css for the game Pardus with more of everything with a cherry on top.

* Make sure you use "Stylus" or you can try it as userscript . Both ways will protect your privacy *
* make sure you install http://gramajda.hekko24.pl/p/pardus/teutonnormalce.ttf font *
Some of the features:
- colors with --var_iables so you can fiddle with them to your liking (initial introduction)
- nav grid and highlight of mouse-hovered fields
- Some of links positioned fixed for convenient access
- Makes Bulletin boards look compact in a way (to disable, you have to delete everything from bulletin boards comment to tables comment)
- better space usage in some places

This probably works faster as userstyle used via Stylus rather than a userScript
