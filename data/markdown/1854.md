### Description
Redesign of IMDb with the colors etc of style 843. The page is too comprehensive to say it's complete but all movie / series / actor / photo pages should be covered as well as the search pages. I didn't bother to meddle with the home page since i always search with a keyword search so i never get to see it. Needless to say all ads and amazon stuff is removed as well.
