### Description
The header at the top of the page is collapsed to a thin horizontal strip, but expands again when the cursor is over it. User info is also hidden - mouse over the video title to restore it. The right sidebar is dimmed until the cursor moves over it.

### Update notes
Comments are suppressed because they're usually inflammatory and rarely useful or entertaining, and because it was too much trouble to add CSS to auto-hide them. Delete the styles under "auto-hide comments" to restore them, if you like.

8 Jun: add option to auto-hide footer

N.B.: I use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>. If this page looks busier in your browser than in the screenshot, that's probably why.
