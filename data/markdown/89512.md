### Description
Draws a small border around the feed links and colours clicked links differently so you will know which pets you already fed (browser history has to be cleared once daily for this to work properly). It also sets the image size for the links so you'll be able to feed a pet even if its image doesn't load.

### Update notes
Inspired by the great userscript <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/110887">Valenth Finder by SougonNaTakumi</a>.
