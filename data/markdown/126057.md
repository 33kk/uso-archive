### Description
...
This Style tweaks the "Wikipedia 1911" theme with some small yet powerful changes:

- Hides all superscript reference links (You'll never look back!)
- Changes all link colors to navy, which means they are distinguishable yet not distracting
- Tweaked the transition times and cursor activation area of the TOC and Left Panel for better fluidity and accessibility


If you'd simply like to hide the reference links and change up the text color, here's the CSS for a standalone style:
