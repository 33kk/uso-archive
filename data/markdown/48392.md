Mini FAQ~
Q: How do I install the theme?
- Everything should be explained here: http://userstyles.org/help/stylish.
Q: When I installed it, it affected all the websites I go onto. How do I fix it to where it stays on tumblr only?
- • Click on Stylish. & where it has your theme title & information, click ‘edit’.
• When you’re at the editing page with the code and ect, below the code section it should have a ‘Applies To’ section. On the drop down menu, click on ‘Urls starting with’ & the type in box beside that should have www.tumblr.com set in it. If it doesn’t, type it in. 
• On the left side of the page, click ‘Save’. & your changes should be made. c:
