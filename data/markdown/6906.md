### Description
This is an extension to style 6738.
- adds support to Google calendar and several icon replacements to Google Maps and Google code
- redesigns Firefox startpage (as requested)

It doesn't make sense to use it without style 6738, since many rules are only defined there.
I recommend you install it even if you don't use Google calendar and Google code. It includes some Google Maps navigation symbols. The two styles are actually one split in two parts ( style 6738 got too big to fit in one style).
