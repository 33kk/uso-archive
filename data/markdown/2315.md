### Description
Based on style 1989.

NOT designed for use with the LookItUp greasemonkey userscript.

* removes everything except the search box & the definition.  No adblocker required.
* does NOT fix the position of the search box.  It will scroll with the page.
* adds background colour & border to the search box that matches the site's styles

25 April 2008 - Added url for tfd.com.  Includes edits for custom removal of other elements (deleting "/*" and "*/" adds an element to the "do not display" list).

I can not duplicate installation errors.  Please post your code in the forum.
