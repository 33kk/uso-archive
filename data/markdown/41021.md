This restyles the menu toolbar button of the "Personal Menu" add-on version 4.3.2 (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/3895) when it's menu button is placed in the Tabbar, to integrate seamlessly with the rest of the bar, and changes its icon to the Blue Firefox icon.

Tested on Firefox 4 and up to the latest Firefox Beta/Aurora/Nightly builds.
