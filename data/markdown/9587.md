### Description
ｷﾀ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!

v1.3

Updates you may have missed:
-Darker, more readable font colors
-Widescreen support (kinda)
-Other small tweaks to make it look nicer

This is exactly what it sounds like: a cute, attractive style for 4chan that also includes everything from the 4chan improvement style (http://userstyles.org/styles/5200).  Looks best in Yotsuba B. Here are the features:

(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞

From 4chan improvement:
-Rounded corners on replies (made extra round here)
-No ads
-fixed position post area that scrolls with the page (mouseover opacity)
-fixes blurry thumbnails in fx3

New Stuff:
-Konata background\
-Super-round look
-Translucent replies and thumbs
-Borders on replies, thumbs, and post table
-Attractive pastel color scheme
-Links bold on mouseover, no underline
-No border between threads
-No "Reply Mode" bar

(´_ゝ｀)

NOTES about the screenshot:
-I'm using the 4chan firefox extension
-I'm using Mona font, which you can find here: http://monafont.sourceforge.net/index-e.html

(´・ω・｀)

Tweaking this skin for dummies (a few tips):
-If you don't want mona font, you can change the font by going to this line of code:
>font-family:"Mona", sans-serif !important;

-If you don't want borders on thumbs, go to this line of text and change "8px" to "0px":
border:solid 8px rgb(0,0,150) !important

-If you want less rounded replies/postform go to these lines and lower the number (4chan improvement used 8px for replies and didn't change postform at all):
>td.replyhl, td.reply{-moz-border-radius:45px
>-moz-border-radius:20px

-IMPORTANT: host the background picture somewhere else! So go to this url: http://i33.tinypic.com/2qx7w5k.png, save it, and replace it in this line of text:
>background-image:url('http://i33.tinypic.com/2qx7w5k.png')

( ゜▽゜)=◯)`ν゜)

Issues:
-Not 100% skin
+Front page tables not covered (but why would you go there anyway?)
+Buttons are back to plain white since it seems no one can change the browse button, and having all but one button look the same bugs me
 -In some non-worksafe boards, the reply field gets shifted off-center. I don't know how to fix this
 -Code is messy and probably contains a bunch of unecessary stuff in it
 -Font (if you don't use Mona, maybe Tahoma or Veranda is the next best thing)
-4chan extension stuff not skinned yet

Please provide feedback, lemme know what you think.

About me and my styles, and how to get me to make more of them:

I update my styles a lot because I often make stupid little mistakes AND I like to tweak stuff to death, so make sure you always have the most current versions of the styles. I will note a few important changes in the description. 

Thanks for the big number of installs on the Konata skin! I am truly flattered. Because of this response, trust me, I will continue to make more skins in the future. In fact, if you drop me a line I will even take commissions. At this point, my proposed prices are 10 bux for a 4chan skin and 20 bux for other websites. This is because I have more knowledge of the 4chan CSS and am not yet a full-fledged CSS wizard, so each new site will have a bit of a learning curve for me. Also in general there are still several things I don't know how to do, but I could easily make some skins even more involved than my current ones with a little bit of research. 

COMMISSIONS IN SUMMARY:

-$10 for 4chan skins and $20 for other sites. If the skin is pitifully simple I'll drop it to $5
-Talk to me at kifte_arcane@hotmail.com or quiche on Rizon
-Tell me what you want and I will try my best to deliver
-I will work closely with you and you'll see beta screens
-Skins could take up to a week to complete
-If I fail at making the skin for some reason, you don't pay
-Payment is expected once I tell you a skin has been completed and show final screens

Also, random acts of donation are highly appreciated. WHY DON'T YOU PAY ME A LOT, FOREVER?
