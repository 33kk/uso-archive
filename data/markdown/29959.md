### Description
Makes links more visible and pretties things up a bit.

1. Makes sure only actual links are underlined.
2. Makes links more visible in general (Color better contrasts w/ regular text & links within paragraphs are underlined for colorblind users).
2. Different font color for visited links.
3. Adds some (IMO) nice styling to the story saving page.
