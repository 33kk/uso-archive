### Description
This Google home page is VERY white, minimalistic and cleaned from all clutter. 
Some pic's <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/64D">home page </a> and <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/64E">search page</a>

Updated to work with the new Google homepage layout. Oh yeah, well this is a never-ending-story... Google do changes all the time, faster than I change underware! 
I think I hate Google, a future monster Big Brother (as George Orwell described it in his book "1984", read it!). 
How ironic, I style Google in an innocent white dress :/
