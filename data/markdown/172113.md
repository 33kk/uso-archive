### Description
Makaveli in this Killuminati, all through your body. The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty

Created specifically so that the site may look more appealing to the eyes, and that it will not put a lot of strain on it. Created by Leaf, some very useful fixes added by Nicolito (https://www.brick-hill.com/user/27929/). Rock--Solid Version is a version with everything fixed, meaning that there will be no errors (unless the css were to change for the site), but other than that everything is perfection.
