### Description
Restyled SE WI Waukesha Country Library System site(cafelibraries.org) with a black background and better color scheme. I'm of the style school that feels big bright white backgrounds are harder to read. Styled a little more generically for the different cities and overcame some of the styling bugs in the original and in the site.  The color aesthetics are not perfect because each library has its own color scheme, but I feel its at least an improvement.  Open to suggestions.
