### Description
Turns Flock dark gray. I borrowed some code from other styles. Made because there aren't many Flock themes.
Seems to work pretty well with this (Makes the tabs not rounded): http://userstyles.org/styles/17786
(Just search for "  background: #5f5f5f !important; " and delete it.)

Commented the menus to allow different styles for them. I recommend deleting the menu portion and installing Dark menus (blue) [http://userstyles.org/styles/28209], so the autoscroller works correctly.
