### Description
(1) The horizontal menus at the top are now a single vertical menu at the right side of the screen. The search box is there too - it shrinks to the width of the menu when it's not in use. (2) The sidebar collapses to a thin blue bar at the left edge of the screen - hover over it to restore it. (3) The "Read me next" growler doesn't protrude as far as it did (which was too far). (4) The useless lead photo is reduced in size. Hover over it to restore it. (5) Adverts are hidden, as are Taboola links and other syndicated "content".
