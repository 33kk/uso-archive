### Description
A dark userstyle for gitlab, with some green tint.

This is my first published userstyle, and I'm a noob in css, this means:

- The goal of this style is to reskin GitLab to a dark theme for everyday use, so making the about.gitlab.com subdomain, or other parts of gitlab that aren't "useful" look nice is OUT OF SCOPE.

- In the profile page, the activity graph is sadly generated as HTML in a weird way (all of the little boxes are the same from the CSS point of view) so I can't do much about those being light.
Any suggestions to fix this is greatly appreciated.

Please don't report these as "bugs".

I am accepting suggestions about the useful parts of the site though, and if someone knows how to exclude a subdomain from the userstyle, please let me know.

Thank you, and enjoy!
