### Description
Applies a pseudo-Bootstrap styling over batch.cardsync.xyz for Trello to make the UI a bit more useable. batch.cardsync.xyz is a service for Trello to easily manage boards, however the UI is a bit lacking, especially for logging in which is quite unclear. This style fixes these issues.
