### Description
tired of blinding yourself while adjusting your lineups, adding & dropping players, watching the scoreboard during your matchups or otherwise using the popular fantasy sports site fleaflicker.com? 

well, i surely was... so i created this dark style which i've been using since around the start of the 2013 nfl season & figured i'd finally go ahead & share it.

in addition to the delightful dark theme, this style includes a much larger scoreboard.

long after i first created this style, Fleaflicker added a Dark Theme option to their Account Settings menu in case you weren't aware, but there are some things about it i don't like very much & maybe you're here because you feel the same way. i still much prefer my own darker style with larger scoreboard & i hope that you will as well. 

enjoy! :D
