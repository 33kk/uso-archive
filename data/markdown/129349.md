### Description
Makes the "Brawl in the Family" website revert to it's old color palette (Black text, yellow comic area) to make comics seamlessly integrate into the page again. 
(The top bar is half opaque-transparent as well, causing the buttons to hang over the page, making it sleeker.)
Also, select comics (such as all Waluigi comics) have custom page backgrounds instead of the default Blue (Occasionally with a little more included as well).
