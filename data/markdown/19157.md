### Description
I got fed up with the cluttered TechCrunch's bulky and cluttered design, so I cleaned it up quite a bit. It should work on all of the TechCrunch blogs including Crunchgear, MobileCrunch Techcrunch Japan, Techcrunch Europe, Techcrunch France etc. This started as an improvement of style 2785 by user 3202.  Inspiration also came from style 6616 by user 7344.

If you prefer comments intact, here's the version with them:
