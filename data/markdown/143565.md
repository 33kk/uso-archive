### Description
A darker theme that's easy on the eyes.

Featuring various dark colors for ease of navigation. 
Other small features for a cleaner look.

EDIT:  As of 12/29/17 FiMFic has created a "Night mode" and it's not half bad. From now on, this style will not be updated, as I find the night mode acceptable and officially supported.

I'll leave this code here should something happen in the future but as of today it's no longer supported.
