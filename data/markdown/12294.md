### Description
Makes gmail chat more compact by reducing space between lines, also making messages like "sent at 2:38" more compact

You can also have more space by uncommenting the font modifying row in the script.

Use the source, you can tweak the height of the chat window also.

Note: you can see the timestamp after installing it (but I compressed the png, that's why you cannot see on the screenshot)
