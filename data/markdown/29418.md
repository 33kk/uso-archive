### Description
The new navigation bar that appears on the left of the search results page throws me off because it indents the search results, throwing me every time I look at them.  This style hides the new navbar, getting the search results closer to the way they used to look!

Note that this only affects the US version (google.com), remember to change the domain to your local version if need be.
