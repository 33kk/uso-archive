### Description
Firefox

version: 0.3.4

--[description]

Mozilla renders plain text files within HTML, BODY, and PRE tags, with no styling.  You can observe this with Web Developer Toolbar, shown in the screenshots.  The <pre> must be the only-child of <html><body>

Definately safe to always leave on, now.

This also styles View Source pages, which is now shown in the Before Screenshot.

I added chrome:// as a url-prefix, as well.
