### Description
Restricts the body of userstyles.org to a maximum of 1024px wide, instead of it being stretched across the entire screen-- for people with large monitors.

In my opinion, I think it looks better because most websites (like Facebook) have all of their content within that width, and not spread out across the width of the browser/screen.
