### Description
Changed the colors of the Sage[1] theme, "Rounded"[2].

Most colors are dark or black, while most of the text is what the style used or "darkslateblue".

To use, simply install the "Rounded" Sage style, then apply this style in Stylish.
This style may or may not work/look good on other Sage styles; I haven't tested. If you find something you want changed or you think this looks cool with another Sage style, leave a comment so others can take a look. ;)
