### Description
css filter to disable view of subscribe value, likes and views of each video and user on random pages used on youtube server. the purpuse of this is to have a better focus on more important values like perceiving a video content for gaining user feedback by adding a comment or contact the author himself (herself) rather than just clicking on a button. make things simple and inspire each other, numbers are just numbers. ;) help me improve this filter finding another values that still shows! thank you! --czokhobo
