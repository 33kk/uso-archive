### Description
NOTE: This is for the current YouTube layout, for the classic layout see my other theme "CLASSIC Simple YouTube homepage"

A theme that simplifies YouTube. 

The homepage is now uncluttered by "Recommended Videos" and "Recommended Channels" that seek to distract and waste your time, instead, the website is toned down to the point where it resembles google.com. 

When watching videos, the sidebar on the right that shows recommended videos is removed, the focus is now on the video you are watching. 

Videos are intended to be watched in Theater Mode, however Standard View works too.
