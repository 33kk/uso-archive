### Description
For Firefox 4 or later

This brings back the Feed indicator in the location bar.

To make it work you have to customize your toolbar as such :
Location Bar - Reload - Stop - Feed
or Location Bar - Feed

Known issues : 
- This prevents from resizing the search bar. Workaround : remove the Feed button, resize the search bar, then put the button back.
- Does not work well with addons that modify the location bar.
