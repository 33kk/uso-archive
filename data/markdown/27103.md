### Description
Does What:
Removes the adds and recovers space (where possible)

Why:
gaia pissed me off with the new ad layout for the mp 
ad block plus was good enough till then

Note:
May need updating of gaia every fixes a bug (http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/t.59975233)
the bug is more than just css this version does not attempt to fix that bug
