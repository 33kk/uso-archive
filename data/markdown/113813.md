I will really appreciate a comment to let me know if its works or not in your browser, if there is some kind of bug or a thing to retouch, thanks!


<strong>NOTES:</strong>

- The reason why i ask you to spell "Search" is because this text (located in the navigation bar) doesn't change in accord to your lenguaje, so it's needed if you want the correct word show up.

- This style includes the free usage font Roboto but dont worry, only applies to this particular style, so you will not have fonts conflicts with other styles installed, also the font is compressed, so it only display correctly English, French, Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese.

Initial release: 11-5-2015
