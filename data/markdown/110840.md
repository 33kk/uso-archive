### Description
Fix for https://userstyles.org/styles/110803/cal-google-calendar-red-grey-and-blue-tasks (it only works on Firefox)

A better looking skin for Google Calendar with Google Tasks.
The Red color is based on apps like Fantastical, Cal (Any.do) and the Mac Calendar icon.
The blue bar for Tasks is based on apps like Any.do, Things, etc.
The Red and Blue doesn't mix well but I did it for be visually separated.
I hope you like it.
