### Description
Makes your Gmail:
- dark blue with stylish background
- using transparency and an Aero bar
- using Segoe UI as standard font
- darkening out those "white" stars

I use a compilation of the following styles:
- style 4096 and style 11993 by by user 3695
- style 6896 by user 8458
- style 12366 by user 12179
- style 4374 by user 5193 (I will soon release a little fix, so that the non-english Googlemail-Users can use this without those wrong-sized buttons.)


### NOTE ###
This is NOT a userstyle, its more an information about combining other userstyles and releasing a fix soon.
