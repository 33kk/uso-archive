### Description
Makes the menubar look like the toolbar menus (Page, Tools, Help) in Internet Explorer 7.0, using the same icons as style 1123 (see that style for information on the icons and how to change them).
For "Icons Only" mode, apply style 1119 on top of this.

Works in Firefox, Thunderbird, Flock, and Sunbird (see previously linked style for Sunbird notes).
Testing mainly done with: Firefox 2.0 in XP-style Windows, Firefox 2.0 in Windows Classic, Minefield in XP-style Windows, and Minefield in Windows Classic.
