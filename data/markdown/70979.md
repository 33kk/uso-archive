### Description
Change the width of tab characters in code from the default 8 spaces wide to 4 spaces wide. For Ruby code, tabs are 2 spaces wide. (Number of spaces is customizable using the Customize Settings button.) This style applies to code anywhere on GitHub – in repositories and in Gists.

For example, code might go from
<pre><code>really
        long
                indents
</code></pre>to
<pre><code>more
    reasonable
        indents
</code></pre>This only affects code indented with tab characters (<code>\t</code>). Code indented with multiple spaces will look the same.

Is this style still needed? As of 2020-02-18, yes. Some time after I published this user style, GitHub added a feature that recognizes <code>.editorconfig</code> files in a repo and uses the specified tab size when displaying code from that repo. However, GitHub still uses a tab size of 8 in the large number of repos with no <code>.editorconfig</code>, so this user style is still useful.

### Update notes
Updated 2020-02-18: now works in diffs as well.

See also my user style “<a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/89425/all-code-has-custom-tab-size">All code has custom tab size</a>”, which affects all websites.
