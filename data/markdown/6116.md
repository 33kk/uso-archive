### Description
Makes vampirefreaks.com look generally nicer.

here are the details for the stylesheet:

changes the font - if you have calibri it will use calibri other wise it uses arial.
changes font size - to 12px its small but still legible so more can fit on the screen.
unless stated otherwise leftnav's bg is #000000;
The top menu's colour is changed from white to #bb55dd which is vf's purple.
the vampirefreaks.com image at the top is replaced for a new - grungy image.
leftnav links are always centred.

on the main page, the links on the right (top boys, top girls etc) are all hidden. They are useless anyway.
the three news boxes near the top of the page are also hidden - nobody looks at them and they waste space.

This style looks much better with the calibri font, however it's not required.
to get the Calibri font download it from http://cid-75f5a24f843645e9.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/CALIBRI.TTF and copy/paste it into C:\WINDOWS\fonts
