### Description
Now has custom colors for the header!

Naut is a customized CSS for reddit made by reddit user Cryptonaut, found on /r/Naut. It is used in many subreddits natively through subreddit styles and RES. I made a global version of Naut's night-theme for my own personal use, but I thought someone else might like it.

Note: To make this style universal, you have to turn off "allow subreddits to show me custom themes" under display options in your reddit preferences. Or if you use RES, you can turn off individual subreddit styles that do not work well with Naut.
