### Description
-= Old Vista Aero Glass transparency impression =-
Vista Aero Glass effects can now be enabled by the Glasser Theme: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=649449
See my new theme: style 6771

Inspired by style 3874 from user 241 this style mimics IE7 behavior with Vistaglazz applied.
Vistaglazz keeps maximized Windows transparent.
Tested on firefox 3.0 and default theme only.

See http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=633274 for a clearer picture.

To change the background picture:
In Stylish edit mode find on line 45:               background-image: url("aqua image") !important
Delete >aqua image< (string between the quotes) and then put the mouse cursor right between the quotes ("here").
Then click the Insert button > Data URI... select the .jpg or .png image to load.

Reply @ user 5424 :
Thx for your review, I decided not to make this style obsolete because using the example aqua.png I found this style still nice and usable on my non-vista systems.
