### Description
This is a red version of the style made by naglfar and celuie.
I used the red color and design of the old red theme of last.fm. I like the old red better then the grey-olive.

This style has the shoutbox on the left (only on profile page).
The library is still on the profile page.

Update (22-12-2009)
- Various button-color changes
- Smaller footer
- wider shoutbox on user profiles
- Shoutbox changed a litte
- To much to put here... 

Update (18-12-2009):
- Various small fixes
- Fixed the forum pages not displaying sinatures the right way.
- Red tags for events and music page.
- Red border around radio buttons
- Library tabs now look the same as inbox en settings tabs.

Update (16-09-2009):
- Update header and backgrounds to match better to the old red style. (Take a a look at http://lastfm.zage.org.uk).
- Now using blue icons for subscribers.
- Now using gray bars for the charts.
- Shoutboxes on groups/artist/events/tracks/albums moved to bottom (evererywhere except on user profile).
- And more small fixes. 

Update (13-09-2009):
- Whole screen is used now. 
- Library on user profile now always show 2 rows with 4 artists.
- No more blue buy-buttons.
- Various header fixes.
- And more small fixes. 

Update (11-09-2009):
After the last.fm header update this is my first atempt to fix this. More updates will follow, but this update fixes the most important stuff.
