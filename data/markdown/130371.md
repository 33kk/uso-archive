### Description
There are several userstyles to darken the google suite overall, but in my experience not much attention is paid to poor old Google Calendar.  I constantly have this tool open, and its default whiteness is too much for my poor eyes to take.  This style fixes that.

The source SASS for this theme is available (with my other stylish themes) <a href="https://github.com/zposten/stylish">here</a>.
