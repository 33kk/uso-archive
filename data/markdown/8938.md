### Description
Makes the following changes:

- Removes the profile box.  This means that the 'Hey There!' box is removed and the little birdie sits on the user's photo
- Changes twitter font to lucida 14px.  Increases line height
- Twitter text entry box font changed to monospace
- Links prettified

Not much changed as it's pretty excellently designed anyway!
