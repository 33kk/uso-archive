### Description
DISCLAIMER: Support for this theme may be limited given that I no longer have access to classroom given that I'm no longer in high school, nor do I use this website. I am still happy to help where I can, but as of now, consider this code deprecated.

A darker Google Classroom style. Feel free to edit or suggest edits, not only is Classroom quite difficult to code, but it updates its styles frequently so I likely missed a few spots (one that I know of). I figured I may as well construct a somewhat organized theme for people to work from and possibly improve upon for now.
