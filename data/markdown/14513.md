### Description
2010-06-20 -- Incorporated "Ad Blocking FiltersetP" into the style code.  I previously overlooked the fact that this style is enabled with my Calculated Risk style in my userstyles selections.  Without this code, my Calculated Risk code does not display as intended.  Ooops.  

-- Easier to scan and read, especially the frequent blockquotes in the articles
-- Some ads removed from footer and top of right sidebar

The screenshot below depicts the page rendered with the userstyles code.
