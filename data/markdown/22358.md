### Description
The Straight Dope Message Board (http://boards.straightdope.com/) is kind of interesting to read but who's going to pay to belong to a forum?  If you're not going to pay to belong why would you need the links to start new threads, respond to others, etc.?

This style increases some font sizes for readability and removes ads, links to start new threads, respond to others, etc.

15 February 2010 - More ad removal.
08 November 2009 -  Removed ad placeholders.
