### Description
If you need a style that works for Google Search, Reader, and AdSense Reports, please give style 1082 a try.
I recommend users to install style 3958, too. It makes Gmail's attachment icons look prettier.
The icons in left sidebar is from style 12286, thanks to user 3203.

Attention: 
1. It works only for Gmail 2.0, but not for other Google services.
2. It works best with Gmail "Tree" theme.
3. It doesn't work with Gmail Labs "Right-side chat" and "Right-side labels" features.
4. The "Invite a friend" area must be placed at the *last* position of the sidebar, so that it can be removed.
