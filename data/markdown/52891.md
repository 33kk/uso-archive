### Description
This is for the Dragon Age version of the Nexus sites, which restores fluid width and expands correctly for any size monitor. I've also changed and enlarged the fonts for more readability, removed the new background image (unnecessary with a fluid width), and moved some things around.

I've tested it with several of the sub-pages, namely the file area, the images for the files, and the comments, and those are satisfactory. Some other areas have the header graphics looking incorrect, but it all still seems to be usable. Also, I can't add functionality that's not on the page itself, like the endorsement info or tracking info, just style what is there.
