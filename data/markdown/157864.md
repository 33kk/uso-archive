### Description
A very pink/purple version of the modding discussion pages on the osu! website.
Because if it's not as pink as possible, is it really osu?

Due to how the website's URLs are set up, some of this code will effect Beatmap Information pages too. 
I may make an expanded theme later on to recolor the rest of the website, but I just want the modding discussions to be easier on the eyes for now.


IF SOMETHING BREAKS:
Contact me @NoffyNoffeh on twitter! I'll fix any errors that come from the website being updated as soon as I can.
Also if something breaks, be sure to check your theme for updates, I may have already fixed it.
