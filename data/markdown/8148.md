### Description
This is a tweak for Glasser+vista integration, I took style 7404 by user 9501 and tweaked some more things:

1. url bar and search bar look the same now in aero mode and vista basic mode. Glasser will only skin the urlbar when Aero is active. That annoyed me since some of my apps force aero to shutdown while they are running.

2. Re-added the right border to search bar, I think it looks better with borders on all 4 sides

3. Added some padding below the url bar (same thing as style 6588 does)

Before and after screenshots show the difference in vista basic mode
