### Description
A fix for the recent update on google docs that broke every single other dark theme here.

This is the white version of the theme, see the cool sepia version here:
https://userstyles.org/styles/161627/google-docs-sepia-dark-theme-fixed


To change the paper color, edit the CSS by scrolling all the way down and changing the "BEGIN Paper Background" section's #ffffff hex code to whatever color/hex you want.

Feel free to message me if this ever breaks again or if someone comes out with an improved version I can use...
(Someone please figure out how to invert the colors of the outline bar from view -> outline)
