### Description
In the 'Installed Styles' popup tab, (1) restores the "click to toggle enable" behaviour, (2) shrinks the screenshot, (3) removes the installs count. (4) Moves the master 'Off' switch to the top of both tabs. 

If you've opted-out of the spyware (as you should), (5) the 'Style Library' tab reverts to the old 'More styles for this site' link and (6) the hated 're-enable the spyware' nag is removed.

### Update notes
Since throwing the 'Disable all styles' switch disables this style too, the popup layout will immediately and dramatically change. Consider it a reminder of why we need a usable layout to begin with and not the dreck we've been given.

If you like, you can install just the bit that removes the nag from the 'Installed Styles' tab.
