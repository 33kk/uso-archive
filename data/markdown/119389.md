### Description
Hey, umm this is a skin based off the anime "Akame ga kill", it's a good watch so if you haven't already and have some time to kill go watch that ;D.
Anyway back to the point this is a skin based off that anime, with a couple of the characters that are in it, couldn't put all of them, so sorry if the one you love the most isn't in there :[
If you find anything that's broken in the skin, you can contact me on <a href="http://origin.psim.us/">Origin</a>, Origin is a side server, if again you have time to kill I definitely recommend you checking it out.
