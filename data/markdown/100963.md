### Description
A simple style that changes the creepy goat on the LiveJournal error page to a sad cartoon character, which gets the point across without being disturbing (although you can change the image by replacing the bit.ly url in the code if you would prefer a different picture). Huge thanks to qwerty321 for making a joke error page so I could take some of the code for this style and to cartoonfaces.net for the stock picture.
