10.14.13: hey!! i would just really like to thank all of you who are using my theme. i really appreciate it. when i first released my themes i didnt expect them to get so many installs and i wouldnt be in this position i am today if it werent for all the feedback and support you guys give. thank you all so much!!

05.10.14: i got a message a while ago saying that the bg on the theme was messed up so i changed it. :-) also, userstyles wont let me change the screenshot some odd reason but the actual theme 100% better than the screenshot since it's pretty old and i've just got around to revamping this theme. thanks for using my themes!!
