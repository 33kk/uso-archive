### Description
Hi, 2009. Aliens strike back.

*** This new version will work for both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3. ***

For extra effects, see style 9289 .
A new embedded version is available. It is *really* huge (approx. 1MB) so I can't publish it here. Get it at http://quantumsearcher.net/designs/addons_tech/alien_tech_firefox_addons.css
You can download a copy of this style on my own server in case it doesn't work here. See http://quantumsearcher.net/designs/addons_tech/alien_tech_firefox_addons_direct.css

This style intends to replace the default style for the firefox add-ons site: clear, light and simple. Here is a dark alternative for those who don't like it, need a change, or simply save their eyes while browsing late at night ^^
