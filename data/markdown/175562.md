### Description
Toning down of bright backgrounds.
Standardised colours on links to more easily see what's been visited or not and whether any new posts since last visit.
Width set to max 1000 PX (easier reading IMHO than a full width page)
A few font size tweaks to make some blocks easier to read.
Change quoted post background colours.
