### Description
Photobucket employs a anti-adblock tool that displays a popup, blurs photos, and disables scrolling. 
This remedies that stupid problem.

If I missed anything, please leave comments. Photobucket is being overzealous about people paying to use their site (not that anyone should really use it these days).
