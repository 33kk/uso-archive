### Description
I made this style for myself - need to see current rates and last trades without scrolling, so I just reduced padding, etc. to be able to see at least 5-6 last trades. Also red button "Cancel orders" is hidden - I tend to mouse over it and it stays on screen displaying its drop-down menu.

Looks best at 90% zoom in the browser.
To utilize Google Exo 2 font you need to uncomment one line in the style because @import is not allowed at userstyles.org
