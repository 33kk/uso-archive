### Description
A dark theme for ask.fm because white UIs suck. For this theme to work, you need to be on the default ask.fm theme (orange). Accent color is customizable. <s>Check the additional screenshots for examples of different accent colors.</s> It seems like Additional Screenshots no long appear on this website (even though there is still a tab for uploading them). Here's an <a href= "http://imgur.com/a/I07ID">imgur album</a>.  This theme also is applied to the responsive mobile view if your browser is below a certain width.

I try to keep this style as up to date as possible. If you notice anything broken or would like to suggest an improvement, just <a href= "http://ask.fm/skiddiks">ask me</a>.

### Update notes
I've also made a userscript to remove featured answers. I figured I'd plug it here since I assume most people installing this will also find it useful. Get it <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/16423-ask-fm-featured-answer-remover">here</a>.
