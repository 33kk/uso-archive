### Description
For those of us who like to use non-standard OS color themes know how ugly pages can get when they default to the colors that the OS is using. This style fixes that problem by causing all input UI devices to default to black text on a white background instead of the OS color-scheme. I did not chage fonts, borders, or sizes of anything only coloration. Also, I did not make this !important so pages with custom input UI CSS can use custom styles.
