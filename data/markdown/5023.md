### Description
This is a sorta major retheme of the FF3Beta3 for Vista. I haven't tested it on any other versions yet, or on any other OS, so I have no idea what it will do there. I'm just posting it here... well because I like it and I'm too lazy to make a real theme. It may break things. It may not work with things. I provide no guarantees.
