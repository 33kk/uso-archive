### Description
This is a very nice simple tab looking appbutton to go with the  Firefox 4  - Rounded Tabs <http://userstyles.org/styles/44825/>. At the moment best used with Moveable Firefox Button 1.3 as it was installed as I wrote may update so it's no longer needed at all soon. Inspired by Firefox 4 Maximized Appmenu Button As Tab <http://userstyles.org/styles/39724> I wanting to make a better looking appbutton tab to go with rounded tabs.
