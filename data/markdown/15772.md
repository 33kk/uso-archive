### Description
New version for marking nofollow-links with ideally not distorting the design of websites.
Thumbs up to http://rimien.com/ and his "mark-nofollow-links" userstyle, which this is based on.
PS: In Firefox, click on "Show image" ("Grafik anzeigen") and hold CTRL while doing that. This way you see the before-after-screenshots in full resolution.
UPDATE 18.11.2009: This v1.1 provides an improved visibility of the linktexts.
