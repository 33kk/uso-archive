### Description
Applies just the toolbar icons from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/">FXChrome</a>, to use with any theme!

For example, the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-theme/?src=search">Arc Theme</a> seems to work very well with this.

### Update notes
<u>The icons will appear messed up in the Firefox menu</u>, so I recommend using something like style 97314 to fix them, or just placing them to a toolbar, where they look correctly skinned. 
I actually would've added the menu icons to the style, but it seems like FXChrome separated all the icons (unlike FX default theme, which uses an "icon map"), so I just didn't bother recreating it.

To reduce code size, I've split the two DPI selections above and minified the code.
If you want, you can also remove one of the color variants from the code manually.

I've posted this userstyle in good faith and assumption that I follow the licences correctly. If there are any problems regarding copyright or such, please post a discussion below. Thanks for understanding!
