### Description
Results in columns, compact interface, no ads and dark blue theme. It works in all locations of Google Web Search.



Something does not work properly? Got a question? PLEASE email me (battleprogrammertidus at gmail dot com) so we can discuss it. THANKS.

I NEED HELP: I'm using this style every day and I was thinking do a more consistent color desing but I am a systems analyst programmer, so, Can one of you (I'm thinking of a designer or someone with this type of profile) help to make a color palette to apply to this style? I was thinking about a dark theme with transparencies and cools efects. Anyway, all are invited to do a mokup with Photoshop and the screenshot below, or whatelse you want. PLEASE send me your mokups via email here: battleprogrammertidus (at) gmail (dot) com. With everyone's help we can make this style better. THANKS!!



ATTENTION: The code became very large (over 65536 characters, which is the maximum allowed in userstyles.org for each style) and so I was forced to split in order to add all the new features. From now on, you should also install this style:

- style 18978



Customize:

- You can easily change width of search box by changing the value of the "width" property of the following line:
input[type=text], td.nobr.xsm { width: 280px !important; } 

- By default, automatically creates two columns, but if you want you can set the number of columns that you want. You just have to change the value (2) of the following line in your code:
-moz-column-count: 2 !important;

- You can change anything you like. The code is fully documented and clean. Watch the code and look what you want to change, the comments identify that part of the code corresponds each group of properties.


Take a look at my other themes for Google Web Search:
- style 9844

And my compact and clean style for Google Image Search:
- style 9941

Inspired by the following styles:
- style 843 by user 667
- style 728 by user 558


FAQ:
- "Advanced Search" and "preferences" are inside the search box, with a small size. By passing the mouse over shall be made larger.
- Mozilla Add-on GooglePreview has compatibility with zero-configuration.
- Google reader compatibility with zero-configuration.

PS: This style is recommended for panoramic screens or with great resolution  (the recommended minimum width is 1024px). The screenshot is made in a MacBook, with 13" screen and a resolution of 1280x800. The recommended use is for Firefox 3.5 or above. You can try to use with any other modern browser but, you have to adapt the specials -moz properties, like -moz-border-radius, -moz-box-shadow, moz-column-count, etc.

PS(2): I took a lot of work and I have tried to make it as compatible as possible so, please, the least you can do is report the bugs to my email. I can not always be attentive to this page to see if someone complains that something does not work. I am not asking for money, although donations are always welcome, thank you. So, please, let the scores for the style in general and not to punish me because of a bug in that I had not thought of. If you report any failure to my email will be better for everyone.


Changes:

June 25, 2009:  Bug fixes and more compatibility (you can see again the logo's Google home page, support for new feature "Show options...", new color (black) applied to the bar's results search, new css effects (you need at least Firefox 3.5 to see it), the searched words with more visibility on all the page, "Searches related to: " at the bottom's page now is collapsed by default, and auto-expands when mouse is hover.

July 2, 2009: Fixed the problem reported by heartrobber18. I have not managed to reproduce the error in my browser, but I added the code implemented by heartrobber18 for its own style. I hope this solves the problem without having to rely on another style. Code adapted to the new html (changed by Google).

July 9, 2009: Correcting the position of the bar with the total number of results.

July 15, 2009: Fixed a bug that affected the position of "Display Options ..." after selecting an option outside of the default.
