### Description
This style takes the tabs up another notch, when tabs on top selected, to bring them next to the menu button.
Other than this when a Tab is selected it displays the favicon of the website along with the website title. The Inactive tabs are turned into favicon only tabs, just like apptabs. The Close button only appears on the active tab whenever it is hovered on and is invisible on the background tabs

This Style has been tried on Firefox 4 betas with success on windows 7 and Vista.
