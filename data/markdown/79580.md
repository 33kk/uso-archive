### Description
Some simple changes to the new YouTube design (beta as of October, full as of December), to make it look a lot more like the older design. (Centers the page, removes avatars, no more plain white background, old front page design and more). Click for more information, feedback is much appreciated!

### Update notes
Try my other styles as well, if you miss the old YouTube channel design
or don't like Facebook's new design:

List of changes:
---------------
* Re-centered the whole page, instead of the left-alignment it has now.
* Hid the avatars, it's YouTube not Twitter, Facebook or Google+...
* Brought the old background pattern back, the white background was a pain for my eyes.
* Brought the dark background behind videos back (in large size), for the same reasons.
* The guide (left sidebar) on YouTubes startpage looks a lot more like the old one now.
* Removed the guide / or guide toggle buttons on video page. Does anyone use them?
* Smaller cosmetic changes. (The dislike bar is red again. This one's important ;)
