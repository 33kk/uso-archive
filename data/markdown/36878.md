### Description
It makes your Epicmafia web soooo dark like your soul is. :)

It's combination of black, dark grey and azure colors and it's based on one style here. I changed rest of colors, added support for forum and shopped pictures to the dark version. 

Also, style includes effect text-shadow, which works best on Gecko engine (Mozilla Firefox or Lunascape). You can delete text-shadow hyperlink effect if you experience problem with it. It's one line in code.

Enjoy it.
