### Description
Fixes some of the changes made in the recent UI overhaul.

FEATURES:

1) makes notes look flatter; cards are out.

2) makes notes scroll down with the page; so had to fix the formatting toolbar at the top.

3) places the note title & the source link at the bottom of each note

4) styles the addon to make note menu appear in one row

5) hides the following: 
  - page footer
  - 'add comment' section 
  - 'expand section' link

LAST UPDATE: Google, for some reason, poked around with mark-up causing the style to not work properly. Fixed that.
