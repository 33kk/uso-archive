### Description
This is a style for the new version of Facebook. It makes all the colors dark  and adds a nice green background, making Facebook easier on the eyes. Credit where credit is due, most of the coding came from this style http://userstyles.org/styles/10668.

Update: I found that the Group and Fan pages aren't colored the way they are supposed to be, so I'll have to work on that. Plus, the link above doesn't go anywhere anymore, so I guess that whoever I took the code from is going to have to go without credit, as I can't remember where I got it from anymore.
