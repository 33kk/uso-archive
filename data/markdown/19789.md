### Description
For all my fellow userstylers.  Typography is primarily with Gill Sans - sorry Windows people.

I'm a bit perplexed that userstyles.org has some fairly userstyle-unfriendly mark up.  Where are the wrap/container divs?  Consequently, it's not perfect, but I think its an improvement.
