### Description
This style hides the junk so that the poll results can be easily seen on one  page.

It also makes the results table a little more legible.

(YaHell group polls are often unreadable because they usually display all the members who voted for an option -- making the results table take many pages and cluttering up the table with information that is of secondary importance at best.)

HINT: Use "View image" on the before and after pictures to see the full-size screen shots.
