### Description
Firefox doesn't let you use a theme (themes from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/themes/ ) and FXChrome at the same time, so I wrote this to easily skin it.

### Update notes
FXChrome is a free appearance addon for Firefox. 
It is available here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fxchrome/

UPDATE: If you use Firefox 40 and the development channel of FXChrome, the window controls look normal on Windows 10.

If you would like to adjust the position of the image, edit "background-position" under #main-window. 
For example, if you want to move the image 500 pixels down, set the value to "50% -500px".
