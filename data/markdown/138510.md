### Description
A middle ground for people who liked the 'new look' of the Styl-ish popup, but now use Stylus.

Originally written for Styl-ish to make the horrendous popup look better. I adapted it to Stylus for fun and I kind of like it. I get that it's not everyone's cup-o-tea.
In the original Styl-ish version, I had some trickery to rearrange the order of the the listed styles so the disabled ones went to bottom. Stylus seems to do that by itself so that was omitted.

Features:

-- A larger 'Turn all styles off' switch (kills the popup style).
-- Fancier' Layout than stock
-- Larger clickable area for turning styles on and off (checkbox Labels)
-- Larger Edit and Delete buttons
