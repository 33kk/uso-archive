IconbBuffet Restyled
-----------------------------

My first Userstyle so don't expect anything too fancy.
Let's just call it a Work In Progress - I'm still fiddling with the CSS of the site and I'm also open to suggestions.

Changed:

-  Edited background + edits on rounded corners
-  Editted hover effect on friendslist image borders when hovering over them
-  Added styled blockquote (see screenshot below)


Hope all you IconBuffet members will enjoy it. =]

*note:
The 'Before' screenshot looks a bit .GIFFY but I had to keep it under 75KB.
