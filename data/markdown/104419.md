### Description
Repositions menu buttons to fit better when the scrollbar appears, plus option to show more buttons, set a fixed panel height, reduce button icons and hide the sync button

### Update notes
icon size - 1.0 = 100%, and anything over 80% or 0.8 looks fine
panel height - sets a max height for flex grow, replace unset with pixel value including px after it
