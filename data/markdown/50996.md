### Description
This style reorganizes the message view in GMail to gain some space and reduce clutter. It does so by
- Removing the right side column, with the advertising, 
- Putting the "People" widget in a drawer opened on mouse hover.

This is meant as a replacement for style 11768, style 12449 and style 14740 that were broken by the people widget.
