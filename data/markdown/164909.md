### Description
It's a dark theme for the Toribash forums. I tried to get as many things included as possible, but alas, a few borders may have eluded me. :v

Inspired very much by <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/153346/tb-dark">TB DARK by SurgeTB</a>, though i did end up writing all of this from scratch.

It should be noted that this is ONLY for the legacy layout of the forums! The modern layout is already nice and dark and i see no reason to change it, i mostly keep this theme around because i'm too used to the old layout to switch.
