### Description
Well the name sums it up. For some reason sometimes the "+" for adding to watch later playlist button hides for a day or so, but this shoud fix it. Atleast for now. :)
This problem is with Firefox, in Chrome doesn't have any trouble. I guess they don't have the same implementation of HTML5's button. Other browsers unknown.
