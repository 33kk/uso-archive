### Description
This is a simple userstyle I wrote for my own purposes that makes the opengl-tutorial.org website much easier to read.

Most notable changes:
* Black text on white background
* Syntax-highlighted boxes have a header that specifies the language represented, instead of the annoying watermark
* Website uses full width of screen so you don't have to scroll left and right all the time
