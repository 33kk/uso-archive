### Description
This style use the daily image on APOD (Astronomy Picture Of the Day) featured by a NASA pprofessional astronomer as background of about:home page in Firefox.
It is a simply redirect to the daily image on APOD site.
Code of the fake redirect image is on Github: https://gist.github.com/2948523

UPDATE: I have modified the PHP code to use a random image when the High Image Resolution link returns a 404 (Not Found) page.
