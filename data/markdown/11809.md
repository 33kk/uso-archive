### Description
Removes the major Annoyance from You Tube.com video hosting.  Makes the annoying Google Chrome Ad disappear!  Because we all know, Firefox is superior (better).

Features:
+ Removes DIV Chrome ads (Block)
+ Removes A HREF Chrome links
+ Hides the Sidebar Announcement box, where advertisements are placed... Thanks krisu!

This style is in accordance with keeping Firefox as a browser, because Google's browser is buggy and will give them access to your personal information.

Integrates with Style 9970

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
user 7865's code will now remove Google Chrome-ad from right side panel
Thanks again!
