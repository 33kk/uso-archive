### Description
Facebook is too bright. On a wide screen, there's way to much white space, which is tiring on the eyes, especially late at night. So this style simply mutes things down a bit. The unused parts of the window are mid-gray, and the sidebars are light gray.

Oh, and the ads are removed. :)
