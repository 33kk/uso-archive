### Description
Tweaks the card spacing on Race for the Galaxy on BoardGameArena so that the tableau cards line up with the hand cards, and so three cards can fit in a row in the tableau instead of two on most mobile devices.

### Update notes
Specifically, this style alters the margins and padding so that three cards can fit in 360 pixels of width, and gives a little more breathing room over 365 pixels, so that e.g. iPhones with 375 pixels of width still line up but take advantage of the extra space.
