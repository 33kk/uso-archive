### Description
On some (belgian?) sites you sometimes see an irritating 'popup' asking if you want to fill in a short list of questions to improve the site. This userstyle immediately removes this frustrating stuff. (I only tested it on one site so i'm not 100% sure this will work on all insite-infected sites, but i hope to never see that stuff again)
