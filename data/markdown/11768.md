### Description
This style removes the ad panel from Gmail or Google Apps Mail, relocates the action links (Print all, new window, etc.) from the side bar to above the mail subject, and widens the mail content area.

****** DEPRECATED ******
This is not working anymore after the update that brought the "People" widget in the right side column.
It may be replaced by style 50996.
