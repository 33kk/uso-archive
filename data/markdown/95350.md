### Description
This fixes the white theme of the NexusMods.com forums. They broke a ton of icon links in the ipboard update back in February of 2013. This replaces as many as possible with nearly full functionality.

One thing that won't work is that the message and notification icons won't update to their alert status. This is because the img tags used in the dark theme straight don't exist in the code of the white theme. They've been places as background images on the links, and that's the best I can do.
