### Description
To put it briefly: Classypedia style made originally by Nathan Black. My changes run down to making it dark, improving contrast and keeping stuff like TeX formulas, code samples, tables and whatnot on Wikipedia readable, clear and consistent within new colour scheme. Far from amazing, but does not hurt brain AND eyes.
