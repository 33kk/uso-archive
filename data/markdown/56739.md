### Description
Improves the readability of the articles.

### Update notes
The menu on the left is hidden. Move the cursor to the left, to get it back.

Hyphenation only works with Firefox 8 and higher! Google Chrome does not support automatic hyphenation! (But Safari does! Try this great Safari Stylish extension: http://sobolev.us/stylish/)
