### Description
this it just a simple generic style where you can add any domians you want to

some websites look good with it, while others dont, thats why i didnt make it work for every single page

instead you can add any domains you want to it one by one on your own (just take a look at the code, its very simple)


based on hrwa dark grey  http://userstyles.org/styles/14673

the main difference being that hrwa's style works for any page without discrimination, while this one you must add or remove your own pages to it as you see fit   

tip: many pages will look alot better if you addblock some of the stray images
