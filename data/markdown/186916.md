### Description
English Light Novels, but dark
Also modified a few other things to make it look a little sleeker and less janky

### Update notes
Release!
- Dark Mode
- Blur on novel header image (since it's so low resolution...)
- Dark Mode
- Overlapping content over the header image (it's tall, so may as well make it look kinda neat and use the space better)
- Dark Mode

Update 1:
- Stopped the header image being a link, it was annoying

Update 2: 
- The novel header image was "on top of" the information and tags and like, so the details are now "on top of" the image.
- Dark scrollbar because it's nice

Update 3: 
- They added a nonfunctioning sign-in thing, but that's dark too now.
- "Featured images" are really inconsistently sized, and the thumbnail you see under the title is the same image duplicated above it (without the style). It cased problems with really long titles, so I fixed them. Things should be more consistent across the series pages (until the next update at least)

Update 4: 
- Some stuff broke, not sure how exactly with some of them
- Details changed, so this changed too
- Changed links to blue to match Myne's hair. That's all.

Update 5:
- Some more stuff broke or went missing. Not sure how that happened exactly but I think it's all back
- De-cluttered the page by making the Releasing This Month list a hover section. It's over on the right. Though I doubt people are reading these anyway.
