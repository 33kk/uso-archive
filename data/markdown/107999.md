### Description
just a few enhancements to the layout

### Update notes
this' a stripped down version of my <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/107374/stylish-2-0-0-dark-theme>Stylish 2.0.0 dark theme</a> keeping the basic look of Stylish light and dark themes, mostly changing the toolbar area layout but also adds new scrollbars cause devtools dark theme needs them, tho optional if you think another style matches better

if not been following the development of Stylish 2.0.0xx the check for errors button was added to earlier beta versions before preview was rigged to show errors & obviously been kept on cause is still practical to check without previewing, its just personal preference if you use it or not, so more superfluous than redundant

edit, fixed a mixup with id label
