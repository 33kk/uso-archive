### Description
Makes theater mode occupy whole window. Supports hiding or shrinking of scrollbar. Only for the material (aka new) design of YouTube.

### Update notes
The top bar is shown when you place the mouse within 14 pixels of the top of the page. This ensures you can click poll / recommended videos icon - something other theater extenders I've tried can't do.
The style doesn't effect non-theater mode unless you use the dark theme on YouTube.
Thin scrollbar is currently only supported by Chrome and newer versions of FireFox. Thin scrollbar color is only configurable in Chrome.
If you have Iridium addon installed, you can use <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/172302/youtube-big-theater-cinema-mode-requires-iridium">a slightly different version of the style</a>. The main difference is that the version dependent on Iridium uses regular page scrollbar in theater mode, so YouTube can scroll the page up when you navigate to another video or resume playback.

Revision 2 - there was an invisible, but clickable hint area, it was a YouTube bug.
