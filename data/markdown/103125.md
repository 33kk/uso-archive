### Description
My original theme was started off for just Gmail. Which can be found here: https://userstyles.org/styles/100289/android-kitkat-inspired-gmail-theme

<b><u>*** That theme is no longer supported or developed, so please do not use it ***</b></u>

Well that was not enough for me since i am solely using Google Apps now it had to do more, I have tweaked the Gmail theme a bit more and fixed a few bugs but have also now a full working theme for Google Calendar, with work on Drive underway as i have time and other Google interfaces to come later.

This theme was originally adapted from the use of the TT DeepDark 9.2 thunderbird theme from Steva @ www.stefrosselli.com

I hope you enjoy this theme, a lot of work and many hours was put into customizing the css to perfection. If you find anything that is broken or needs some work, please let me know and i will do my best to resolve them.

Donations are welcomed and will keep my enthusiasm to continue development on this and future themes.
