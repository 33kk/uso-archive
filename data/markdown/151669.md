### Description
Requires <a href="http://frankerfacez.com">FrankerFaceZ</a>. The CSS selectors used in this stylish are mostly added in by this extension.

The default colors for this stylish are intended to be used with Dark Mode on Twitch. If you are using the default Light Mode on Twitch you may want to change them.

Removes all but four Twitch Chat Badges. Badges are displayed as a four pixel border at the left side of the Chat Line spanning 100% of the height (one pixel is taken off so consecutive lines that have badges don't blend together).
The following are the Badges still shown:
<ul>
<li>Twitch Staff</li>
<li>Global Moderator</li>
<li>Broadcaster</li>
<li>Moderator</li>
</ul>

Chat Messages are formatted to be aligned with the Nick. So messages that are long enough to create a second line will not go under the timestamp if you are using them. Timestamps are fixed to be right aligned.

### Update notes
<br/>
<code>I only use Google Chrome so if there are issues with Firefox they aren't going to be fixed.</code>
