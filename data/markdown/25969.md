### Description
I created this style to make the "new" Salon.com less blinding... Removed the horrid bright-red components (background, bullets, etc.), unified all backgrounds to another color, then changed the text & link colors to match. I also simplified a bit by removing the overdone "share this" links and javascript ads.

I tried to document what I did so you can change things to suit your own preferences. Feel free to modify & repost improved versions!
