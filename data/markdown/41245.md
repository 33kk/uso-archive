### Description
With the release of Heroes of Newerth 2.0, S2 gave the community the ability to buy avatars, different name colors and icons. I liked the old "cleaner" look better, so I threw together a mod to remove the following:

"Diamond" name colors
Avatars bought in the shop
Icons bought in the shop

Update 1.03:

Fixed for the "new" layout on the forums.

Update 1.02:

Now also removes "silver" namecolor bought in the shop.

Update 1.01: 

I removed the signature removal, since it is possible from the user control panel.
