### Description
Another dark theme for Firefox's about:reader. I made this, because all I found here was not working (at least for me).
Contains part of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/114669/firefox-reader-custom-width-multi-column">MiV's  Firefox Reader: custom width + multi column</a> style.
