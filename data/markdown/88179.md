### Description
Restore flickr photo pages to something resembling the traditional viewing of photography by using a white background and effective whitespace.

### Update notes
All icons are now working correctly in Safari, Chrome, and Opera. Still working on proper icon support for Firefox, IE, but I can't promise anything.

1. Updated to support Flickr's latest monstrosity.
2. The right side is quite light, just enough to still make out the background icons, but not so dark as to be present. I like it, one can adjust it by changing various background colors to a darker color (e.g. #fafafa is quite light, #f0f0f0 is darker).
3. Left/right display nav-bar arrows removed. The arrow keys on keyboard still work normally.
4. Removed "add title" field when a photo doesn't have a title. Annoying and unneeded.
