### Description
Combine the Stop and Reload buttons into a single button. 

NOTE... You have to right-click on the toolbar, select "Customize" and reverse the position of the Stop Button and the Reload Button as shown in the "Before" screenshot below (*)

(*) Some users of Firefox 3 have reported they did not have to reverse the position of the stop and reload  buttons.

If it doesn't work one way, try it the other way :)
