### Description
Don't you hate how YouTube Player is not centered to a split screen browser window?
Well I do!
Split screen is available on all major operating system since:
<ul>Windows 7+</ul>
<ul>Apple El Capitan+</ul>
<ul>Most Linux Desktop Managers (Such as Cinnamon)</ul>

Yet when you make a half screen browser window with YouTube running, the YouTube player is right of center!
This bothered me so this quickly centers the player when the browser is half screen size!

(<strong>Might not work on other resolutions which are not Full HD 1080p</strong>)
