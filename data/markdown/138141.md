### Description
<b>New version 1.0.1 alpha has been released!</b><br><b>Caution!</b> <i>It's much alpha version. You may confront with over 9000 bugs that can damage your neural health. :D Joke, I looked many pages and did see little bit.</i>

Tell me that Mozilla's resourses are you using?

Mozilla has made a rebranding and presented the some new website design. They has worked and made main page. And here I revealed myself and have made an impingement!

The title is not without reason. The style kills new actually desing of Mozilla.org, for example, I have cut the scrolling in more than 2 times. And it's not all. Install and you will see yourself.
