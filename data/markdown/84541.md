### Description
Peaceful background for google basic search, suitable for use as your home page. Extraneous elements are hidden or auto-hidden. Works in Firefox and Chrome.  Should work for international sites - let me know of problems.

Due to frequent Google changes I have hidden the top bar completely for now.

<b>"Google Instant predictions" must be turned off in your search settings.</b> On the Google home page, click on "Settings", then "Search Settings".


My intention is to only include pages similar to www.google.com (not search results, image search, etc.) I appreciate being notified of any odd results, or problems. Do this by starting a new discussion (below) so other users can see the issue and resolution. If I don't respond promptly, feel free to send me a private message letting me know you posted something (otherwise I don't get notified by email)

Thanks to user 169 for the image and idea, from style 71806

To use this style with a custom background image see style 96109
