### Description
<b>WARNING: Unlike the 2010 design version, this one seems to break the real 2011 UI. Unlike the 2010 one, this one only works on the new UI.

Note: Before you install the userstyle, make sure the main sidebar with compose, inbox folders etc is expanded, inbox tabs are off, make sure your display density is set to Compact and in Settings > General, make sure Button Labels is set to text or the script won't work properly.

Also, if you just want the old logo, use this script: https://userstyles.org/styles/159153/old-gmail-logo.
</b>

Enjoy! This destroys the new 2018 Gmail UI and changes it back to the 2011-2018 era. Also changes the logo back on Basic HTML.
