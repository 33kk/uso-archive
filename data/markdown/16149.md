### Description
Changes the style for quotes on the TAC-forum
* 2px blue border around quoted name and quote-text.
* No separate border around the quote-text.
* Tranparent background.
* Quote-marks before quoted name.
Note: this style is fragile with respect to details in the page-coding.

Update: replaced the gif-image of the quote-marks with a semi-transparent png-image to get proper anti-aliasing.
