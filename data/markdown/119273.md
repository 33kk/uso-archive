### Description
matFlow is a dark theme for the WorkFlowy web app. It started initially as a few tweaks locally and ended up turning into a full-blown theme. It has a flat clean design that enables your eyes to relax and focus on what is important; sex, drugs and EDM. There are a ton of bugs.
<br><br>
DISCLAIMER<br>
WorkFlowy offers a paid upgrade. I think you should support them as Pro gives you much more than just themes. This style does NOT give you access to any of the Pro features. It is just CSS.
