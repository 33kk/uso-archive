### Description
http://www.icts.uct.ac.za

ICTS department website is colour challenged. Here's quick fix to remove certain background images and restyle colours.
No change has been made to positioning. The style however does affect table TR and TD elements inside served pages. So for example, the Technical Information page includes an element coloured green at the top of the page - this changes to a global blue.
