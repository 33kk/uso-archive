### Description
Forces websites to display the images only - that is, IMG elements only, so background images won't be viewable with this!

Tries to hide everything but the images and displays them inline. Attempts to remove emoticons, avatars, logos and other stuff to clear the way for the "important" images.  Also displays how many images there are.

Page background-color is an olive green.  Outlines image links in orange (not guaranteed), non image links are outlined in black.  Transparent image will be laid on top a checkered background.

Caveats: 

<ul>
<li>Hover effect lags on some pages, like various Wikipedia articles.  Position and display rules are causing this, but they are fundamental.</li>
<li>May not work on pages with frames.</li>
<li>You'll lose your place on a page, including all tabs, if you're reading an article :-)</li>
</ul>

Good for quick browsing of image threads, oekaki, whatever.
