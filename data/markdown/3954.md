### Description
I liked having "Compose Mail, Contacts, and SignOut" in Red Bold.  However, I have been updating this thing constantly due to constant element changes; this was to be my final edit, and I obsoleted it, and then thought "What the hell, this is cool!!" so I've unobsoleted it and fixed it.

These elements change often; don't be surprised if they "go away," but often I update that same day.  Use DOM Inspector to inspect the element of what's changed, and correct the style yourselves to suit your particular address anomalies.   Last change before this was April 25th; it will continue to be in flux.  Today is July 14th 2008, and yet more changes - so I think we can expect new changes every 2-3 months.  Enjoy while it lasts!! /

Cheers all / Paul
