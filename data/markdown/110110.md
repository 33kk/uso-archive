### Description
A bold yellow (color customization optional) Firefox theme with caution stripes on the tab bar, striking a balance of gloss and grit, and fully supporting lightweight themes/Personas. Updated from style 44063 for Firefox 29 and above, and now properly updated for the latest and greatest (Firefox 48 as of this writing). Linux only; untested on Windows and macOS/OS X.

### Update notes
2015-02-04
* Fixed lightweight theme/Persona compatibility.

2015-03-16
* Tabs line up with the top of the window in fullscreen mode so you can just throw your mouse to the top of the screen and click something.

2016-07-13
* Fixed problem in which tabs would constantly judder while customizing browser button layout.
* Resolved problem with location bar indicators showing up when they shouldn't.
* Tabs restored to normal orientation (previously upside-down). Issues with tab text behavior solved as a result, as well as problems with loading icon not displaying.
* Restyled tabs to somewhat resemble the old style ones in style 44063.
* Menubar menus were restyled to avoid text coloration problems with updated Adwaita theme on Linux.
* Menubar is now always custom-styled to avoid background coloration problems on certain GTK themes.
* Fixed new tab button's bottom margin.
* Improved compatibility with Status-4-Evar.

2016-07-28
* Pinned tabs no longer show a blank tab label.
* Background color is now adjustable.
