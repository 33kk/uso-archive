### Description
Want to take a screenshot and keep  the users anon? Enable this style to do just that!

Doesn't hide unlinked names in comments.

You are free to use or link to this without asking. In fact, please don't ask me anything unless you wish to ask me to add support for another website.

### Update notes
Release 3.3

Fixed the fix.

Release 3.2

Doesn't work consistently, reverting

Release 3.1

Adds a more apparent blur which blurs it more

Release 3.0. 

Adds support for YouTube on Mobile. Very basic but still workable!

Doesn't work on unlinked names as they are just divs sadly.
Now only makes links that are to G+ or <code>/channel</code> (well really <code>/chan</code> but that's no issue since it works the same either way) blurred, rather than anything that is a link.
