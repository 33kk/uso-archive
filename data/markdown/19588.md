### Description
This style minimizes all labels in gmail to look only like a box.  If you mouseover each box, it will expand to show you the name of the label.  This greatly increases the amount of space for text in your inbox, esp for emails with many tags on them. 

I have also shrunk the ad sidebar down to save space, hovering over it will give you access to the options such as print, new document, and new window.
