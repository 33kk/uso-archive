### Description
Tumblr 'new post' icons for your dashboard.

"<i>The word derives from the name of Ã‰tienne de Silhouette, a French finance minister who, in 1759, was forced by France's credit crisis during the Seven Years War to impose severe economic demands upon the French people. His name became synonymous with anything done or made cheaply. [Before] photography, silhouette profiles cut from black card were the cheapest way of recording a person's appearance.</i>" <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette">*</a></sup>
