### Description
Dark mode for ELMS/Canvas.

### Update notes
This was made for University of Maryland ELMS/Canvas website, <b>but...</b>

it should work for any university's canvas, just change the link appropriately and change the colors to your school's colors (or whatever colors you want). Default colors are Maryland Red and Yellow. Link must be changed on your end, but colors are changed in customize.

If you think anything should be changed or isn't right, let me know and I'll try to get around to it.
