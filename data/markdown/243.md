### Description
I was having a heck of a time reading postings to newsgroups in the gmane interface from permalinks.  So, I used EditCSS to comment out the font-size directive in the .blogbody class.  Yes, it was a simple hack, but it saved my eyes.  When I figure out how to make this with Stylish, I'll update it.  For now, it's just a todo note.
