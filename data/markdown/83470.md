### Description
This style changes the caligraphy style fonts used on memrise to web style fonts found online and in printed chinese, to make recognizing real world characters easier and make the experience more consistent between desktop and tablet. A modification of the "Memrise Japanese" style by ShadowDrgn, though I removed the custom background feature because it wasn't working and I wanted to keep it simple.
