### Description
This style is just parts of coding put together from freestyler's "firefox 3 - tab tweaks" and from http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/code/userchrome.txt. 

This style gives the tabs a border and makes the minimum width 8px. It also makes unselected tabs transparent. However, you must change the value for browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to 0 in about:config. The default minimum width is 100px, and that will override any CSS coding that you write and use. 

This works for Firefox 2, but I'm not sure about Firefox 3. I have tested it on a Windows XP operating system, and have not tried it on any other, so I am not sure If it us compatible with anything else. 


Glitches and Bugs:
- When you have a lot of tabs open, they start to overlap. It looks bad, and is probably not supposed to happen. 
- Others? If you try this on your computer and you find more problems, please write a review stating the problem so that I can put it up on the description and try my best to fix it.
