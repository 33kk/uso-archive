### Description
- - 2 Styles are available - - Firefox 50.0's update removed the link for PLUGINS update check from the Add-Ons Manager (Ctrl+Shift+A ---> Plugins). Firefox 50.0 Release Notes state Firefox now automatically checks for Plugins Updates, but there is no check-done confirmation. I decided to manually check for Firefox Plugins updates (especially to verify Adobe Flash is up-to-date) at https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck (USA user URL), and bookmark that webpage. Since I use a Dark Firefox theme ("FT DeepDark"), Mozilla's bookmark favicon (a dark gray lowercase "m") is nearly invisible (see screenshots). My 2 userstyles for Mozilla.org's favicon ("Orange & Blue" and "Blue & Black") provide favicons that show up well for most Firefox themes, including dark ones. As the screenshots show, I prefer squared tabs (a setting in the Firefox extension "Classic Theme Restorer"), and also use the extension "Tab Mix Plus" (which has a SUPERB session manager). See NOTES for my Old Google Favicon.
