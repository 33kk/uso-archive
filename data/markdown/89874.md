### Description
Newly revised, this fixes many issues including the hard-to-read fonts. I used the Firebug plugin to get the information I needed and the result is neither perfect or pretty but it at least creates a usable back-end to work with. I have no guarantees how it'll look on your computer and if anyone wants to make any improvements I encourage them to do so and please share. Good luck!
