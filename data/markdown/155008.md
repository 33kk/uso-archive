### Description
Slightly changed background of Wikimedia Foundation websites (except wikivoyage.org) to make reading easier for you.
This is my first style-changing noob work. Background is made out of 2 small ".png" images which are downloaded from https://i.imgur.com/. If imgur.com is unreachable for you this style will cause no effect.

If you found bugs you can try to let me know about them, but i am not sure i will fix them as soon as possible, because i am a bit retarded. May the balalayka be with you.
