### Description
 Search Engine Tagmarks (Version 0.1.5)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Description:

As the default search engine icons are favicon of the websites, 
there are different search engines using same favicon ( like the wiki "W" and the Yahoo! "Y!")

Also, I like the Scroll Search Engines (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3696/), we can quick switch the engine by scrolling the mouse

Those makes me more difficult to know what search engine I using... (especially there are search word on it)

In my old way, I use text editor to get the base64 image and modify it. It seem work but make me feel annoying

So, this style can use the general search engine name to identify each of them, with a icon on the search button

p.s. can use ~= even if Peers installed
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.5:
- add icons in search menu

Version 0.1.3:
- Only have few types like (en), Hong Kong, Japan, Video, music, Add-ons 
- You can find more icons on this website: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/
and use base64 encoder (http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp) to get the base64 source


I still tying to improve this style ... hoping that anyone can give suggestions or feeling after use it (it is useful? ) to help improve it
