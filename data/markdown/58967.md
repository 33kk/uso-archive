### Description
Originally, I  was only going to make this as a simplifier for browsing through many images in Pixiv in one go to pick out my favorites.

But I couldn't resist going the whole hog with it, so here's a full version of my Dark Gallery theme for Pixiv.

Works best with the Pixiv Pages loading thingy, but you can use it without it (a navbar'll pop up if you pick the right option below).

Should work fine on most pages - for obvious reasons I can't test the work management page since I don't have anything uploaded. It *should* function fine even there, though.

### Update notes
Unfortunately due to the way the Pixiv Paginator loads pages, I can't join elements together smoothly one after another - so there will be "blank spots" inbetween pages if the current amount of images per row isn't divisible by the total on a page.
It's a very minor issue, but unfortunate.
