### Description
This is a supplement to style 85954. It is intended as a lightweight replacement of Adblock in Firefox for Android. The sites where it works will be guided by my own predilections.

Adblock on android is a very resource heavy addon/app. It makes firefox unstable, causes repeated crashes. Having a userstyle do the same job instead is a easy substitute.
