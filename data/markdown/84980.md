### Description
Property, instance method, etc names are much more obvious, as is the declaration code. 
Left navigation doesn't clip most words, content area is fixed width, inline code words set in Google pretty print style.
Availability, Declared In, See Also, Related Sample Code appear in inline boxes.

Not perfect (constants are still ugly), but a big improvement if the current style is miserable to you.
***May require edits for small screen resolutions.
