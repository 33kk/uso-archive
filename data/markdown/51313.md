### Description
This style is intended for those who sort primarily by importance and would like extra color to differentiate more important from less important groups of tasks.

Features:
- highlighted groups red/yellow/blue based on importance.
- fancy yellow note field (credit "Toodledo - MacOSX")
- gray, italicize, strike-through for completed items

Works with ToodleDo's site update after Sept 2015.
