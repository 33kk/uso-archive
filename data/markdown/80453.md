### Description
Replaces the plain, white tab icons with colored SVG icons.
 "The better to see them with, my dear."

Unless you specifically want SVG icons, you'll probably be happier with style 108170.

### Update notes
Confused? All that counts is that last input, which isn't a URL at all but rather a color value. You can enter <ol>
<li>A hex color value, such as <code>#A0522D</code> (Firefox users must replace the '<code>#</code>' with '<code>%23</code>')
<li>An <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp">rgb() color value</a>, such as <code>rgb(160, 82, 45)</code>
<li>An <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp">HTML color name</a>, such as <code>sienna</code></ol>
