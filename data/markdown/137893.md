### Description
A simple theme for that ones who use a vertical monitor and browser 4chan in it.

It has different styles for SFW and NSFW boards.

Everything is settled up for a 1080x1920 monitor. You would be able to edit with a few fixes if your res is different.

This is made with the assumption on that you will have 4chanX without the JSON index.

Please, be sure to read the additional info since the new addon (in both, stylish and stylus) reads the code in a different way and breaks everything. If you check for updates remember to check the page first as it will be probably be new information related to the CSS.

### Update notes
03/02/2018
Seems like the addon still brokes my CSS. There's a new way of getting it if you don't want to make the previous workaround:

A) Click show CSS
B) Copy it
C) Write a new style, in stylush (which I use) there's an option which says "as userstyle". Mark it
D) Paste it
E) Be sure to still check 1st line since the font import is there
This workaround is really easy, as you can see, BUT it won't let you to import any font since stylush is a genius and importss it as http, without the S. Keep that in mind.

With the latest update on stylish, the CSS can be messed up. The fixes you have to do are really little, but you will have too make them local.

A) Set everything on a same window editor. Then change domain to 4chan.org
B) Each @-moz-document that you have in this same page, in the "show CSS" section, should be copied the same to your style on local.
B.1) In case it tells you to put it in another section, try to copy only the part after "regexp" (the long one) and type the previous by hand.

Sorry for the annoyances of the changes, but new addon engine + stylish fucking it up made it this way. Sorry folks.
