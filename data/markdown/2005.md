### Description
Strips the page of unwanted elements keeping only the searchbox & the definition. 
Intended for use with the LookItUp greasemonkey userscript similar to style 1989

Update: made the dictionary & thesaurus radio buttons visible

Note:
1) If you install this style as a userscript you'll have to manually enter the site rules from the greasemonkey manager dialog to make the script run only on merriam webster.
2) If you have installed the LookItUp userscript edit the iframe width in the settings panel to 440px &
add: overflow-x:hidden (to make the horizontal scrollbar go away)
