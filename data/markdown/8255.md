### Description
This is a mod on "painted black", incorporating some small changes to make overlay divs work properly, as well as to make highlighted rows work as expected (borrowing and modding from "Gmail 2 highlighted rows". Also, the divs used for extended combo-box selects (the options on your mails, for instance) are slightly cleaned up and fitted to the style. There's nothing all that original here -- it's more that I would like to be able to access this fixed version from another pc easily, and I figure that someone, somewhere, might derive some usefulness from this.

NOTE: there is a specification in the initial header which will enable this style for vision-impaired people. It's commented out because I'm too lazy to upload this style twice and screenshot it again, so look for it in the first @-moz-document section, and remove the comments (/* and */) from the line:
/* font-size: large !important */

Hopefully this can be of some use to people with deficient eyes  (:

User feedback is appreciated.

Changelog:

2008-11-26:
* Set a default background color instead of "none"; solves issues with dhtml items where the text
    becomes unreadable because the div has a transparent background and the div text appears
    inter-mingled with the text below.

2008-10-21:
* updated to fix placement of search items (again). Once again, YMMV. Works nicely for me, with the compose mail link next to the search options (a little more compact) (updated: moved down a little again: compose div was interfering with search div such that search text couldn't be entered)
* buttons made a smaller at request of feedback. I can't make them (or the search entry) smaller (height-wise) without hitting ugliness issues...

2008-07-02:
* Updated to make the background of email address auto-completions opaque
* Added hover row-highlight to auto-completed email address list items
* Added default, fallback body text color (since I've had difficulty tracking down the message editing div with the DOM inspector) -- now you shouldn't see black text on a dark background
* Altered padding on top section (search etc) to fit better -- this seems to have become broken only this morning, so I don't know if this is a because of a change from google, or just my system being stupid. YMMV. Works For Me (tm). Etc.
