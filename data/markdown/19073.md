### Description
Changes the appearance of the open audio/video player controls in Firefox.

This style was created out of a personal need to have larger controls and especially to be able to see the time and duration labels.

The screen shot is of the video player zoomed out a bit to be able to capture a screen shot who's final file size would meet userstyles.org's file size maximum. It is clear and sharp especially the text-shadow effects on the time and duration labels in normal viewing size.
