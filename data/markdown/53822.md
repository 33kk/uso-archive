### Description
Shrinks and moves the active scripts badge on the toolbar button so it doesn't push out the margins. Double digits will still push out, but not as much.

### Update notes
I'm using my other script style 53817 to change the button icon. This style still works with the stock icon, but the green badge on green icon will look a bit strange.

2012.02.24 - 54890 has a neat effect of turning the badge grey for the number 0; I added that to mine since I didn't want the other effects in that script. It's a cool script though, I'd probably use it but I think it would conflict with Greasefire.
