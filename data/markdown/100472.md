### Description
<b>[Work in progress]</b> For those of you that go to online school. This userstyle modernizes the look of the lessons provided by curriculum.kcdistancelearning.com, which is used by Aventa Learning with Blackboard. It expands the page width, cleans up and improves the look of the "header" section as well as various headings/titles, and more. The material and HTML may be outdated, but that doesn't mean the styling has to be!
