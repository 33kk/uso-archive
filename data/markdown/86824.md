### Description
2015-11-18:
This style is still available for install, but does have issues. I know there are issues! I haven't had the time, resources or energy to update it. If you still like it, continue to use it -- just be aware that FaceBlack is quite honestly a better alternative. It may not be as minimalistic, but at least there aren't odd transparent regions. I may, at some point, update. I may not. I apologise for any inconvenience. If you want me to update with fixes for issues, donate and I'll try scrape up the courage again (:

This style is a light derivative of "Blacked Out (Rounded Corners)" (http://userstyles.org/styles/59339/blacked-out-rounded-corners-no-ads).
