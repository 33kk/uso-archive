### Description
A simple dark style for CRON-O-Meter for those of us that don't like being blinded by the light. (cronometer.com)

Some time ago there was a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VLw98N6.png"><i>Calories Summary</i>-box</a> added, which I don't like. This theme doesn't correctly show the summary as I don't use it (hide it by clicking the cogwheel and changing the setting). Feel free to create and post some rules to fix it if you care, I'll add it to this style.
