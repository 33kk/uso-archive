### Description
<u>Reddacted 2: <i>Reddit Revised</i>, Revised.</u>
<b>A Convincing Tagline.</b>

<i>Attention to detail</i>
Carefully crafted one pixel at a time, this style completely replaces reddit's drab default aesthetic. It's all retooled to emphasize the important and minimize the excess.

<i>More viewing space!</i>
An auto-hiding sidebar and appropriate padding throughout make reddit easier on the eyes. Waste time like never before. (Or at least as much as ever; who am I kidding?)

<i>REStastic</i>
Designed with RES in mind. Don't have RES? <a href="http://redditenhancementsuite.com/">You should</a>.

<i>Responsively Developed</i>
Find a bug? Have a suggestion? Let me know!

<i>Future goals</i>
* Thorough page coverage
* Deeper RES feature integration (eg. night version)

### Update notes
Based on style 67958 (but restyled from the ground up.)

Developed in Chrome; Firefox Compatible

Things Known:

<ul>
<li>No styling yet for submit & create-subreddit pages</li>
<li>User listing is wonky</li>
<li>Adjustment needed for 3-line (extra long) link listings</li>
</ul>

You should probably disable custom subreddit styles in preferences. (This is more than strongly encouraged.)

<b>High fives accepted</b>

If you like it enough and want to support further development, I welcome emotional and monetary gestures!
