### Description
To get the most out of this style sheet, also install this Greasemonkey script:
http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/57083
(It fixes some whitespace problem in work item descriptions in issue tracker as well as adds permalinks to discussion posts)

The CSS patch provides bug fixes and improves usability for project pages on codeplex.com (releases, discussions, issue tracker, source code)

• Font-family "Arial" instead of "Segoe"
• Visited link color restored
• Original button-look for form elements
• Banner height reduced
• Removing some redundant images
• Bug fixed where clicking in white area selects all text
• Menu height reduced
• Black headings instead of green
• Fluid page layout instead of horizontal scrolling
• Monospace font in issue tracker so that source code can be read easily
• Left-bottom border around comments in issue tracker
• Monospace font in source code viewer
• Enlarged "Previous" and "Next" buttons in pagination controls
• 400px bottom margin added so last line does not stick to bottom of screen

Changelog 2009-Feb-24
• Monospace font in textarea when creating a new work item
• Issue fixed where one edits a discussion post and lower part of hyperlink manager is missing
• Fluid thread list
• Use other color for discussion infobox so it doesn't look like a work item

Changelog 2009-Apr-27
• Enlarged and monospace font in HTML view Rich-Text editor
• Various minor improvements

Changelog 2009-May-22
• Enlarged textarea when adding a comment to a work item

Changelog 2009-May-27

Changelog 2009-August-21
• Removing embedded RSS links in the front page - no longer needed as they are available in address bar
• Source Code check-in listing, get rid of line breaks for more compact listing

Changelog 2009-September-3
• Preserve white space in issue tracker (description + comments) [white-space:pre-wrap]

Changelog 2009-September-4
• Removing some background images that reappeared

Changelog 2009-October-13
• Styling of permalinks in dicussion posts (you need to install the Greasemonkey script linked to above to see the effect)

Changelog 2009-November-4
• Make site header a little nicer

Changelog 2009-November-13
• Banner height top and bottom padding reduced on project pages (again!)
• White space problems in patch upload descriptions
• Rounded borders in sidebars
• Removing redundant site header on CodePlex front page

Changelog 2009-November-14
• Removing Omniture logo
• Removing gray background image in CodePlex header
• Removing background image in "Downloads" box


Additional notes:
• For CodePlex.com I recommend the "Linkification" add-on for Firefox. This makes URLs in CodePlex's "Issue Tracker" clickable. However, for that plug-in you must use the setting:
Tools > Add-ons > Linkification > Options > General > Thorough Mode (needs to be checked)
This is due to the presence of <wbr> tags within the URLs
