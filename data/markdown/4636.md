### Description
Makes contextual links blue which is easier on the eyes (and a standard usability guideline). Also increases font sizes (helpful for larger screens) and changes font to Verdana. Removed the mint green elements and broke the boxiness of the left navigation. Lightened background, and expanded content area to 1024 (from 800). More open and cleaner look especially for larger screens.
