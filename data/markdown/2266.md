### Description
A simple, spare reworking of the userstyles site.  Main features:

* removed all rounded borders from boxes and links
* increased line spacing
* fixed sidebar width
* all dimensions relative (defined in em units)

Please note that Stylish will throw up several errors because the userstyles site uses lots of proprietary CSS (mainly to round borders); my style sheet has to refer to these properties in order to restyle them.  Please ignore them!  Apart from these errors, this CSS validates when put through the W3C Validator.
