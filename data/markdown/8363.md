### Description
**** THIS THEME NO LONGER WORKS PROPERLY! THE CHANGE TO PHPBB V.3 HAS ADDED NEW ELEMENTS. I WILL UPDATE THIS AS SOON AS I CAN LOCATE A V.3 TEMPLATE****

A modified version of my Blue Green Red theme

nearly identical to my other theme

this replaces the Red/white with a visually appealing blue/green theme. the forum body is blue/ light blue, with green elements. surrounded by a teal background. all previously red elements have been turned blue in this version. This helps see links on the main page

this version works much better outside the forum than my previous theme did, and it looks great inside the forum too
