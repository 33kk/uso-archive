### Description
Increases contrast between read and unread emails to the max! Reduces wasted whitespace. Makes messages more compact. Makes the hideous black bar translucent. Replaces all icons with text. Modifications work well on most themes. You may have to tweak text colors a bit to make them stand out on extreme light backgrounds. The code is annotated so that you can change it. Change text-density to compact before you apply this style.
