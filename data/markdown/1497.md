### Description
Adapted to gmail changes, not well tested

unresolved problems:

- the reply dropdown has rollover effects so it cannot be styled

- the coloring of email addresses in thread view is not well adapted

- the tabs in thread view do not have top borders so they cannot be always distinguished (could be done by a replacement picture)

- when in search thread view the control for frobbing highlight slightly reaches into the first email header

- cannot style checkboxes and radio boxes

what should work: message list, compose, thread view, reply, address book

re contrast:

this is the 'decent contrast' version I use. Since the screen has some reserves in this area I do not want max contrast for text. You can use lighter gray for text to make higher contrast.
