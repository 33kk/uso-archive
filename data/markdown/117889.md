### Description
As requested https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/46739/firefox-add-ons-manager-request-for-new-style-or-editing-help-with-css

Styles the about:addons page to how it previously appeared, in Firefox 39 and before.

Known bug: "Available Updates" counter is obscured.

### Update notes
It's a lazy adaptation, don't expect any compatibility or support.

2015-08-27 - False update.  Userstyles.org thinks I've updated the style when I only changed the label of the first option.
