### Description
This style restores the border between the reload button and the drop-down arrow for two reasons:

1. It feels sloppy and confusing to not have the drop-down arrow the right-most thing in a combobox and the awesomebar is intuitively understood to be a very fancy combobox.

2. All the icons within the awesomebar are what Chrome refers to as "page actions". To me, the reload button feels more like a "browser action", which means it should be visually distinct. (That's also why I use the "RSS Icon" extension rather than the toolbar button)
