### Description
Adds the ui of jd2020 to jdn. This is a beta because I'm not sure when the new update for the ui will come out, so this is for people to enjoy.


If planning to use code from this style, please ask me beforehand on discord. (Ticpo#8562)

Huge thanks to Winchester for adding almost all of the banners and album coaches!
