### Description
Fixes the only useful page at the inthemix.com.au - http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/all

Removes all ads and other poorly designed parts of the web page.

You probably have to set your cookie (for Sydney, Melbourne etc) prior to loading this userstyle.

I have no plan to fix the rest of the website because it is a horrible mess and would take forever.
