### Description
A pretty black and red layout for MySpace, with a few pages (The Home Page, and "Interests and Personality" page in the Edit Profile section). I suggest using my style 8738 and style 8740 styles, because they rock and I was too lazy to do anything with them disabled. :P

Feel free to edit the code to change the colors or whatever. And if there's any pages I forgot, comment and tell me. (I wouldn't worry about profile pages because the majority are poorly made anyway. :P)

Please note that on the "Interests and Personality" page, there's no labels. Just remember which textbox/textarea is where.
About Me______Who I'd Like To Meet
General Interests_Music
Movies_______Television
Books________Heroes
