### Description
SEE http://userstyles.org/styles/20789 IF YOU DON'T OWN THESE FONTS. It keeps the layout but uses Calibri and Constantia.

UPDATE: June 6, 2009 -- Added support for German, French and Italian Wikipedia and Wiktionary; per Celuie's suggestion, I also added other possible variations in the font stacks (e.g., not just "Whitney Medium" but "WhitneyHTF-Medium"). The homepages are still a bit off -- any suggestions on fixing this?

The basic look of this style: http://userstyles.org/styles/18397 ...

PLUS

A List Apart's color scheme and link styles (http://www.alistapart.com) ...

PLUS

Stylish bullets in the thumbnail captions and disambiguation links using Hoefler & Frere-Jones' MercuryNumericG4-SemiItalic typeface.

REQUIRED:  Gotham Rounded Medium, Gotham Rounded Bold, Whitney, Whitney Condensed and MercuryNumericG4-SemiItalic.

I realize this isn't for everybody, but if you install and enjoy this style, feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Works PERFECTLY in the latest beta of Firefox -- Windows XP -- Cleartype enabled -- 106% DPI on a 1280 x 768 LCD monitor
