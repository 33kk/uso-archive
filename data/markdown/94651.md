### Description
This is a fairly simple anonymous dark theme I made for my fellow anonymous friends. Just make sure you open links in new tabs and not the current, things might look weird. This is for the main news feed for the "https://www.facebook.com". In the script towards the top, I made it simple to edit the main font colors.
