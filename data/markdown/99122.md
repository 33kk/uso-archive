### Description
Basecamp can get pretty busy with all the conversations. I wanted it more focused. This style:

* Hides Discussions and Files sections from project overview page (focus more on To-dos)
* Hides non-Discussions from the Discussions page of a project
* Hides To-do updates about renaming, assigning, or place-moving
