### Description
Lets you browse Facebook at work without anyone knowing. Facebook becomes black text on a white background, all images are almost transparent until you hover over them, even the Firefox tab that shows Facebook's icon and text becomes blank.

A version that doesn't affect the tab (and works on Chrome) is available - style 88663.
