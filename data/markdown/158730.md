### Description
IMPORTANT NOTE: This solution is not for use with Stylish. You will need to be using Chrome in Developer Mode and you will need to install the extension from the Chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-manager/okeooekaaniggaignhhfeddohlcjadkd

"Tabs Manager" is a handy Chrome extension that displays thumbnails of all your open tabs in a popup window, grouped by domain. It's better than any similar extension, but the thumbnails and popup are too small, and the popup disappears, when you navigate away. 

My solution was to bookmark the extension so that it displays as a tab rather than a popup, edit the CSS to make the thumbnails larger and allow the lists span the full width of the window, and tweak one line of the javascript so that the tab doesn't close when you click on the thumbnail. I also tweaked the colors a bit to help distinguish the tab groups from the page background.
