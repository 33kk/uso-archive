### Description
Since the recent (June 2010) upgrade of the Aya Forum, a new default blue colour scheme has been in place. Although this is temporary, many people find it unpalatable, so I knocked up this quick replacement. Most text is now black on beige, with some forest greens used for certain elements. I've also made the username on posts more prominent, and visited links are distinguished from unvisited ones. 

Not every aspect of the blue has been removed as this is a quick temporary hack, but this should make browsing the forum a bit easier on the eye until the new permanent colour scheme is finished.

UPDATE 2010-07-22: The UCP, messaging and search screens are now beige-backed and all the text and links thereon should be more readable. 

UPDATE 2010-07-23: Improved visibility of "View ..." links on the dark green background (thanks expl0rer)

UPDATE 2010-12-15: Further enhance visibility of "View ..." links, subforum headings in index, moderator lists.
