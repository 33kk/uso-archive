### Description
MBlue Combine Nav-Buttons Vista
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
 1. Combines Stop & Reload buttons.
 2. Gives the same look as the Back/Forward Buttons (Firefox on Vista) to Stop/Reload buttons.
 3. Place the Stop+Reload Button between the Back & Forward buttons.
 4. Supports both SMALL and LARGE Icons.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
-To make it works, place the buttons in this order:

 > (BACK|FORWARD) (STOP) (RELOAD) <

-In customizing mode you'll see the button's background GREEN if the position is right, or RED if it's wrong.

-When using THEMES/EXTENSIONS/STYLES that changes some margins, you may need to change some value manually, if so go to bottom of the page to customize.

24.07.2008 - OK I totally remade this. Now it contains both SMALL and LARGE icons, also better code
compression, and I added more info for changing margins if needed. I also added the
reload button disabled state.

22.09.2008 - New version.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@ xren on Sep 23 2008: Don't use the customize window for changing the iconsize (just leave it small as default). Instead you should right-click the toolbar and select only-icons and small or large icons there.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@ dataman64bit on Sep 24 2008: use this code for now: "#nav-bar {padding: 3px 2px 3px 2px !important;}" (without "")
-------------------------------------------------------------------
@ schuaa on Nov 05 2008: you mean the dropmarker? It is possible, but that would be another style, you can join the discussion for more suggestions. Anyways I'm working on a new more customizable combine buttons style, but don't have much time atm... but it's coming out pretty well!
