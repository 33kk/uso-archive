### Description
To be clear - this is a work in progress.  I doubt I'll be able to put all of Google's sub domains into one style.<br><br>

Originally I just wanted google search to be darker so I could browse man7.org and search without being blinded during a search.  It morphed into almost a complete theme for most of google (except Gmail - separate monster).<br><br>

NOTE: This theme is a big work in progress.  Google Search and News is basically done, the rest will take a while.  Also, in order to keep styles within the google domain from conflicting i had to resort to mostly regex matches.  Please let me know if you run across some crazy glitches, or simple incomplete pages.
