### Description
Minimal theme for 4chan.
- Built around 4 light colors that can be changed through variables.
- Custom logo and mascot
- Made around 4chanX (Post highlight, Custom navigation bar, Thread watcher, Galery, ...)
- Hover the poster name to see date and time
- The galery works but it's a bit buggy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- Enjoy!

- To change the file formatting and the custom bar links like in the screenshot add the content of "Code 2" to 4chanX settings
