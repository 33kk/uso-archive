### Description
This CSS is built to target JIRA as a service from the Atlassian Cloud.

There are two targets for this fix:
1. overrides `max-width` from the overall content view to be 100%
    -- can be seen with blank space on the left and right when viewing a single JIRA ticket
2. overrides `max-width` from issue descriptions to be 100%
    -- can bee seen as blank space between issue description and time tracking
