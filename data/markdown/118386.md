### Description
This somewhat restores the appearance of reblogs to how they were before the September 2015 update.

### Update notes
I wrote this in like, 10 minutes, so if there's something wrong, just let me know.

Update 9/5/15:
Tumblr removed icons, updated userstyle to reflect this

Update 9/6/15:
I think it was actually another userstyle that removed the icons, not sure anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Update 9/10/15:
Makes the "Deactivated" text always visible.
