### Description
This style transforms tabs into buttons.

This style was created with idea to make tabs look better under Linux (it turns out I really don't like default GTK icons and default Firefox theme under Linux) but it turned out that under Windows7 tabs also become very pretty.

So, I decided to share my little (really little) work with everybody else.
Also - I post screenshot from Windows7 since it is much prettier than under Linux.
