### Description
Add your profile name as a suffix to the Customize button label in the PanelUI menu

### Update notes
There should be a simpler way to know what profiles being used in Firefox & with the PanelUI menu the most often accessed menu (in Australis) makes sense to list it there

Btw can use this snippet on clean profiles (& assume will also show in safe mode) by adding it to a userChrome.css file in the profile directory. 
<ol type="I">
<li>Type about:support in the url bar, click the goto folder button, then close the profile</li>
<li>in that folder create a new one called chrome</li>
<li>in that create a new file called userChrome.css or userChrome.txt (if cant edit the file type)</li>
<li>open it in any text editor</li> 
<li>copy the snippet, modify the content with unique profile name</li> 
<li>save it back to the chrome folder (can manually rename extension to .css and save as 'All Files')</li> 
</ol>
