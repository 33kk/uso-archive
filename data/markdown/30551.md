### Description
For users who think the coloring on the location bar for security is beyond excessive. You will still retain the added coloring around the location bar favicon, and you should still click on the favicon to read the "More Information"  which is the same as was and is available using Tools (menu) -> Page Info

If you are concerned about the loss of information within a properties context menus for links, images, providing File Size, Last Modified Date, Content Type and HTTP Header of a link target or of an image, 
you should install the "Extended Link Properties" extension 
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/798/ 

To read what the coloring is supposed to tell you, see these articles:

Firefox 3.7 again respects browser.identity.ssl_domain_display set to 0

This is one of several styles to minimize wasted space on toolbars, look for other styles under my name, user 12592.
