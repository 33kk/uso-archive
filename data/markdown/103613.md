### Description
Just putting this up in case anyone else wants it. Basically, it fixes some nagging annoyances that I have with Weasyl. It removes the background images so that everything is solid color, it removes some rounded borders, flattens the buttons, and fixes a few formatting issues (such as the space between the side of the page and the profile). I also changed the journal list on pages so that it's not just a small list of links.
