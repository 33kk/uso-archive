### Description
This style changes the default look of Hypem/"The Hype Machine" to a dark, refreshing theme with the removal of unnecessary things, aka all the clutter.

### Update notes
This theme was made when ads were minimal and non-intrusive. It should be fine for use without an adblocker for now. If you are unsure at what settings to use, simply install it as is.
