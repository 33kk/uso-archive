### Description
This is a style for GTAForums.com that contains a few minor tweaks to improve the browsing experience.

Features:
Get rid of those annoyingly large images	- Images will be constrained to 700x625, so that you don't have any more stretchy pages. Images which have been resized are indicated by an orange border. Hover over the image to view in full size.
•	Larger text input	-	Text size in text boxes will appear larger so you don't have to squint to check what you type.
•	Smarter Code	-	Large code will be cropped, with a scrollbar, to avoid longish pages.
•	Smarter Quote	-	No more page-long quote trains. Quotes will be cropped, with a scrollbar.
•	Better Report Monitoring	-	Report count in the Mod CP will now appear much larger, so that its easier to keep track.
•	Improved Quick Comment	-	The Quick Comment feature in the Mod CP will now comfortably accept two lines of text, for those who'd like to type out long comments. A scrollbar will pop up if you want to type even more.
