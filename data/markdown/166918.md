### Description
# This ONLY works with the theater mode of the youtube player. If suddenly it all looks wrong, disable the style, toggle the theater mode on, and re-enable the style.
# Works best with Dark Mode.

This style resizes the player, gets some elements out of the way and makes everything "blacker" for a more cinematic experience. Hovering the top 50 pixels of the player makes the top search bar appear. Same thing just under the player for the video title, views and toolbar.
