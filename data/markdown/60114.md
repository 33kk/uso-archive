### Description
For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds. 

This style restores the '[Ext]Firefm' Old Status-bar Icon buttons border appearance, which makes them easier to see when using a dark Personas theme or OS theme. This style is also compatible with '[Ext]UI Fixer' for those that move the Old Status bar Icons to any other Toolbar the [Ext]Firefm Status-bar buttons border appearance will also be restored.

Works well with userstyle:
style 60116

Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora and Nightly builds.
