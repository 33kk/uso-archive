### Description
It is a style for the german variant of selfhtml. It is dark with light-blue text coloring. It resembles the color scheme "Obsidian Coast" that comes along kde 4. I disabled the pictures, because they did not fit. An elegant solution would require some work, for which i do not have time at this moment. Feel free to send suggestions.
