### Description
It is an almost complete change of the benheck forums. The images of new topics and such will come in a later revision.

*Note* For anyone who wants to apply this to other forums, it currently is tested only to work on phpBB 2.0.20. It may work in other versions of phpBB or even other forums, but that is not guaranteed. I am looking on seeing how I can implement it to work in other forums, but that will take a while and I cannot guarantee anything. If you want another forum to work with this skin, please let me know and give me the link to the forum in the comments and I will see what I can do for you.
