### Description
This fixes some of my SoFurry.com gripes:
 - Fill your screen when viewing an image or story rather than wasting so much space
 - Don't rape your eyes at night time when you're on the prowl
 - Remove annoying opacity effects forcing you to hover over an image thumbnail to see it
 - Hide social networking, text control, and story bookmark things
 - Disable forced font sizes and colors in stories (for some reason some authors have font sizing on every paragraph)
