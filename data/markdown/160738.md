### Description
This one is not the same Google Classroom theme going around. I made this one. Compared to the other theme:
- The boxes insides classes aren't removed.
- Dropdowns are dark and stuff like "Create Class" is dark.
- Colors are different, nothing from that theme was copied except for this one line of code; background: url("https://i.imgur.com/oebm7U7.png") #000 bottom fixed no-repeat !important;

Still trying to figure out how to not make the menu left side buttons dark when hovered.. Google made it difficult to use inspect element on that and along with this, another element is used for hovering.
