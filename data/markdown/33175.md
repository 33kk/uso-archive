### Description
Makes the addon detail view panel always visible, with a fixed width of 550px.
The right pane updates when you doubleclick on an addon.
Note that the rightclick contextmenu also applies to what you have selected, not what you're actually clicking on.
(Nothing I can do about that)
Requires a high-ish resolution screen. Or alternatively zooming out or making things smaller with another style.
