"<i>Hermione Jane Granger is the extremely smart and clever best friend of Harry Potter.

Hermione tends to be the rational and realistic one of the group.

She is Muggle-born and her parents are dentists. She is a perfectionist and an over-achiever, and is the only one of the trio to have ever read, or even opened, Hogwarts, a History.
