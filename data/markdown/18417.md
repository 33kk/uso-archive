### Description
Firebug have many third-party plug-ins like CodeBurner, Firefinder, Inline Code Finder, Page Speed, SenSEO, YSlow...But, their tabs use so wide space in the narrow browser width so that some of these are missing sometimes...


This style sheet makes
  1. Font smaller
  2. Eliminate redundant tab spaces
for better appearance.
