### Description
Browsing art in the message center sucks.
At small thumb mode, thumbs are so small that can't see what you're looking at. In big thumb mode, there is so much wasted space that it's painful to use.

mc BIG THUMBS + combines the best of both worlds - the compact layout of small thumb mode and the large images of big thumb mode. Enjoy, and let me know if you spot any bugs!
