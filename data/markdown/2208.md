### Description
One day CastUp started to supply its own player plugin for Firefox. Behind the scenes it is the regular Windows Media Player plugin, but branded as CastUp Player, or CUplayer.xpi.

This script will remove the requirement to install the plugin for CUPlayer (Even not an option for Linux/Mac and SeaMonkey users), and supply the alternate link to the media.

Tested on NRGTV pages, might work for another sites.

Test the script on the following URL: http://www.nrg.co.il/online/10/ART1/503/329.html
