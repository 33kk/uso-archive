### Description
Last Updated @ 6:44pm Los Angeles, CA USA

This style is a BETA variant of my other style, style 40453, and was created at the request of user 91713.

It strips Justin.tv down to its core, leaving the user with the video and ONLY the video! No chat box and most important of all, NO AD JUNK!  The sidebar is now invisible/visible when hovered on and sits under the video player.

### Update notes
REMEMBER, it's currently in BETA. There are still a few bugs lingering around. If you find one, let me know!
