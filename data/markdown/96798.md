### Description
Adds a semi-opaque yellow and green bar that marks 70% repair of a damaged building.

Note: The maximum damage should be 70% rounded up. This userstyle marks only 194px from the left + extra 10px, therefore it is totally inaccurate, especially on buildings with very high/very low hp.
