### Description
<b>For Fx25+:</b>
Keep the addon-bar visible.
<b>For versions prior:</b>
Add the "Activity Indicator" to the left of a "Flexible Space", place these two items anywhere, on any toolbar. The Flexible Space will be coloured green if you've customised correctly. Your status text will appear there (Firefox 4+ only). Uses only CSS; no bloat.

### Update notes
<b>For versions prior Fx25, ensure:</b>
• ¡important! Don't put anything between the "Activity Indicator" (on left) and "Flexible Space" (on right)
• If you don't like the throbber, remove the code ":not([busy="true"])"
• If you want to center the text, replace "transparent 2px" (on the last line) with "transparent 50%".
• Changing minimum width? Replace "15em" (last line) with your desired value.
