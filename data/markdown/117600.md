### Description
Usually we are receiving a lot of emails. I would like to highlight specific name of senders to be emphasize for must read. Easyest way to do it is make Gmail filter and set a Label. But it won't work with mail thread. So I created this stylesheet.

Basic idea is use "CSS3 [attribute*=value] Selector" like this span[name*="john"].

<b>Note:</b>
This is a sample stylesheet. Because stylesheet must have name of senders. I recommend you to use "Show CSS" and copy this stylesheet(not install from here directly) or Install this sample then copy on your PC for your own to prevent accidental overwritten.
