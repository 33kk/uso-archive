### Description
The repository for the old build of /u/'s board describes itself as "the 4chan of VA-11 Hall-A" - yots/u/ba is an attempt at taking that a little too literally.
Several elements either inspired by or taken straight from 4chan's Yotsuba B theme. Includes, but is not limited to:
• Actual greentexts
• Blue backgrounds + borders on posts
• Link and link hover colors taken straight from the yotsublue CSS
• etc.

* Note: if you're a desktop userscript user, I'd like you to know that I have not yet tested several of the userscript options. As such, I cannot guarantee compatability. User discretion is advised.
