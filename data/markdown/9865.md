### Description
With the Firefox Extension "CustomizeGoogle", you can enable Favicons on all Google Searches.  The problem is that on sites that Do Not supply one, CustomizeGoogle supplies a generic favicon.  
I really dislike Generic Favicons, so this style removes them, making the sites without a favicon stand out more.

** Thanks user 1340 for the style 2686 - Similar Idea (making web better), Different Functionality.

- Notice how the Before screenshot shows Generic Favicons for MetaCrawler Web Search.  Google, though, has a favicon, and it is kept.
