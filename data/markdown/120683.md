Styles Firefox to look like Safari 9 from OS X Yosemite and above. In addition to the basic Safari layout, many of the main icons and animations are reproduced using embedded SVG and CSS transitions. Additionally, under OS X 10.11+, the San Francisco typeface is used in more locations than stock Firefox. 

***This style was designed for Mac OS X users and currently does not work properly under Windows, Linux, etc***

Designed for Firefox 53.
