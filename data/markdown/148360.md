### Description
• New night theme for Hype Machine! Based off my other 'Daytime' style, this new theme features the usual refinements but with a fresh coat of paint to give your eyes a rest
<p>
• Various UI, font, & color tweaks to better resemble a music player
<p>
• Moved user menu & search bar for better access when window is pinned to half screen
<p>
• Eliminated distracting & unnecessary elements for a much cleaner look
