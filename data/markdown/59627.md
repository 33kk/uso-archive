### Description
A new art piece and 3rd generation reskin, BETA is the most sophisticated of user 89346's reskins. New exclusive features include 3D faces, glowing buttons, a green Tron-esque motif, unprecedented signature handling, and much more!

Unfortunately, it's not totally done, but it's in a good working state, so feel free to 'beta' test it (if you'll pardon the horrid pun)!

Directly below are additional settings you can configure to make the reskin suit your tastes. If you have never used the reskin before or are unsure what you want, I recommend leaving them as they are. Click the "Install with Stylish" button when you're ready to install.
