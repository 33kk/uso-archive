### Description
Do you ever have one of those notes that seems to go on forever and stretches the whole page?
Well, I'm here to fix this.
Basically, what the code does, is if the contents of a note go over 300px, it'll put the whole thing in a scrolling box.
My first style that I've publically released, so I hope I get some good feedback.
