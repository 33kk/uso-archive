### Description
This style is based heavily on Jonathan Blake's "Imgur Purple". In fact apart from a few additions to better theme Imgur Community and changing the color back to green, it is all his work. You can find the original Style here: https://userstyles.org/styles/107996/imgur-purple

P.S.: I am aware that there are still a few bugs, such as the quote box in posts having white text and things like that, my fiancee and me will get to fixing those in the next few days :)
