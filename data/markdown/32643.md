### Description
This is borrowed code from Perfect Dark Google. [http://userstyles.org/styles/27249]

All I did was enhance some of the text and links, so its neon-ish/distinguishable.  
Give him the props/donation for the coding, i just made a minor adjustment.

I'm not a developer, so feel free to take the code and enhance it.

I'm a busy guy, so if I have time to make enhancements, I will update it when I can.
I havent touched the Gmail coding, leaving that up to the Dev Stormi.
When I have time, I'll sift through it.

But if you make some tweaks, please post a comment with the updated code.
