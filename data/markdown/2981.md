### Description
This style makes the top and bottom borders thick for new posts in Drupal-based forum topics, in order to make it easier to see where any new posts have been made.

[UPDATE: 2007/08/09]
* The top and bottom border style has been changed from solid to dotted, and the left and right border style is now solid.
* Highlighting is no longer applied to a comment being previewed.
* "Before" and "After" screenshots have been added.
