### Description
<b>Since Facebook is planning a major redesign of their platform, this style will also be updated accordingly, but without the "Night mode" since it will officially be available by Facebook.</b>

Now with animated reactions, the ones you see on facebook's Android and iOS applications. It also has elements of "Vivify.css", the "pullUp" effect. <br /> <b>TO COMPLETELY BLOCK ADS ON FACEBOOK, INSTALL uBlock Origin</b> 
<br />
Since facebook is using React.js, which is a library that re-uses components, there are some styles that must stay default, because if I style them, on the other page that same component becomes very ugly and on the other it is ok. Therefore I can't style everything.
</br>
DARK MODE IS WORK IN PROGRESS - EARLY ALPHA. IT BARELY WORKS!

### Update notes
Browser compatibility: <br/>
Google Chrome / Chromium => <b>100%</b><br/>
Firefox => <b>100%</b>

The style has some nice and smooth animations which I think you'll like. They are available for news feed, pictures and messenger. ?

When it comes to "Dark Mode", the colors are stored in variables. So, if you want to change the color of "Dark Mode", open the editor and edit them in <code>:root</code>

The regular updates are just some minor fixes.
