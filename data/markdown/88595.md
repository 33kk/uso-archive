### Description
<br><b>[ [ [ OBSOLETE ] ] ]</b><br><br><b>YOU NEED TO USE 'Advanced Style Settings' BUTTON DUE TO NEW SITE DESIGN CHANGES !!!</b><br><br>Brings back full width style to us.o lost on 20130603, and sets full height for notes. Allows to right align screenshots box, and to remove 20170308 borders on various tables. Displays advanced search items optionally, and allows to reveal metadata on searchs results. Also avoids line wrapping on coding areas of edit pages, and allows to adjust their heights.

### Update notes
<br><b>[ [ [ SINCE 20170427 THIS STYLE IS OBSOLETE FOR NEW SITE DESIGN ] ] ]</b>

This style is meant to avoid the restrictions of 20130603 style applied on userstyles.org http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/35921/feedback-requested restoring full width. Optionally, you are able to choose higher (or lower) than standard width limits for large screens in which you may not want to use a huge width.

Width change affects also to edit pages and their coding areas, this style avoids line wrapping on that areas and allows to adjust their heights. Width change is also applied to forum optionally.

It sets full height for notes, displays advanced search items optionally (adapted from http://userstyles.org/styles/76069/userstyles-org-wider-search-always-show-options without sidebar resizing), allows to right align screenshots box and to remove borders on various tables added on 20170308, as seen in the screenshot. Also allows to reveal metadata on search results (adapted from https://userstyles.org/styles/89792/userstyle-uncover-meta).

Probably you'll also find useful https://userstyles.org/styles/139484/009-userstylesbeautify-catcat520 to fix an issue in styles settings area brought up by late 201702 changes in webpage, you can see it applied in the screenshots (condensed/default for the 2 first options).
