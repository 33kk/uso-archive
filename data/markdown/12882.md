### Description
*** Edit 03/31/11 *** This is currently completely broken. Not sure if I will be updating it.

This style improves the usability of Wikipedia in a number of ways:

* remove annoying banners and warnings, and UI elements which are almost never used
* remove the gratuitous use of boxes and borders to present a "clean" appearance
* justified text when it makes senes
* improve the "color" of the page, making it look less cluttered, by
  -  adding more margins
  -  increasing line spacing and paragraph spacing
  -  slightly decreasing the contrast of the text
* a more sensible color scheme
  -  some gratuitous backgrounds have been changed to white
  -  section headings are in dark green
