### Description
[2009.February.07] Now that the login issue is resolved, I should have access to this and the rest of my styles. I would like to know how many of you are using this style with the NASA Night Launch Theme (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4908) for Firefox?

[2008 October 1] I am sorry for my long absence. I have been without a decent computer for almost a year. By decent, I mean one that would (have a powerful enough processor and large memory space, to) allow me to run Firefox (with all of the tabs open as needed to verify changes in my code). I have now built a completely new machine, after having had numerous machine failures in this past year. I am now attempting to recover from this protracted period of inactivity. So now, hopefully the request below will continue to apply. Again, I'm sorry. But life is often contrary to our desires.

I NEED FEEDBACK FOLKS!!!    CONSTANTLY CHECK FOR UPDATES!!!

As a further note, most of my time is spent on Yahoo! Answers. So most development goes there. The rest has been secondary for me. If you need something specific that I've not included, let me know.

Here are some sample images of this style.
