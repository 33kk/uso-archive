<b>FAQ :</b>

<b>What is 'Fromage' ?</b>

Fromage is the little brother of style 88599 . I hope you will like this style as much as the '<i>old</i>' one ;)

<b>Why 'Fromage' ?</b>

No idea. But, after all, the latest android version is called Kit-Kat.

<b>Why did this style took you so long?</b>

I didn't found the time, I forgot and finally, I re-wrote the whole style ( it is now a lot lighter).

<b>I like the topbar with my favorite subreddit. Why is there no topbar?</b>

Personally I don't need it, this is why there is no top bar. But there is a shortcut to your subreddit on the gray bar : you need to click on the +. If you don't like it you will need to update your userstyle and enable the "show subreddits in the sidebar" option.

<b>In RES, when I enable the nightmode, it doesn't looks like your dark theme, Roquefort. Why?</b>

RES has his own dark theme. It is compatible with this userstyle but don't look like Roquefort.
For now, if you like Roquefort, you will need to install/update reddit Fromage, and choose the option "DAAARK" at the question "Dark theme?"

<b>Some links ?</b>

Of course here is <a href="http://gniii.org">my website</a> and my <a href="http://twitter.com/mwatermelon">twitter</a> and here is a subreddit if you have any feature request or encounter a bug <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fromage_theme">/r/fromage_theme</a>.

<b>What's New ?</b>

Since v1. Everything should be very stable. I've added some "Advanced Options". Only clean up and minor bugfixes ;)
