### Description
The Anilist redesign in my opinion has a little too much blank space on the feeds.
This restores 5-width progress and fav lists and shrinks some paddings and margins here and there.
Edit some months later: Looks like new stuff piles up.

This is just what I use personally, but I'm sharing it in case somebody else wants it.
