### Description
This style removes the unnecessary margins/paddings on the sides of the Google+ site and zooms the page content (bigger text and column widths) to 130% to fill the extra space, while still maintains the three column layout (above 1552px width). This style does not add anything else other than careful fixes to still look as official as possible.
