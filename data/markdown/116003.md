### Description
/* This account is unmaintained, receive new update here https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/tree/master/Userstyles */

Dark theme for https://gnusocial.de and https://quitter.se. For other gnusocial pod, you can try to change the url and logo background at the top of the stylesheet. Also the modified logo images are hosted on imgur, you may like to download it and transfer to other hosts.

Other people may set a dark font theme and bright background, if you want to overwrite their settings, you can add this style: https://userstyles.org/styles/124100/gnusocial-and-quitter-others-theme-color

Advices are welcome ;)
