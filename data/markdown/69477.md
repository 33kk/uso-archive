### Description
This style makes the ridiculously huge Firefox UI in Linux a lot smaller and compact, similar to how it looks by default in Windows. I use Ubuntu 12.04 Unity with the default Ambiance theme so it should look relatively similar to everyone who has a similar setup as me. Just play with the margins and heights in the CSS if it doesn't look right to you.
