### Description
AIGameDev.com is a great site, but whoever first came up with the idea that every site on the web should have a fixed width, no matter the screen space available, should be punished by having their own effective screen width set to one pixel all across the web - for the rest of their life.

This is an attempt at fixing that issue on AIGameDev.com. Please be aware that this is my very first foray into CSS, so if you find anything wrong with it I welcome any *constructive* criticism (as opposed to flames, for which you'd deserve the treatment mentioned above).
