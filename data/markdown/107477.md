### Description
***NOTE: This style has not been updated for latest iteration of Google Keep web interface. Google will very likely be making their own dark theme as they've done for numerous other services and Android apps. For now, I recommend using the <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US>Dark Reader Chrome Extension</a> which I use personally and find it more than capable of creating a dark interface. Only downsides are a slight performance hit on slower machines.***

This restyles the Google Keep interface to be dark with some colored highlights. Larger areas darkened where convenient.
