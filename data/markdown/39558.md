### Description
I like the new design of the WoW forums on Battle.net, but like others I find the lower contrast to be hard on the eyes after a while. All this script does is change the basic font color to white and increase the font size from 12px to 14px. Some basic checking showed that quoted text is also white and larger, the Blues are still blue with larger text, and your edit box still has black text.
