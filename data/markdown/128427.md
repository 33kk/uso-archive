### Description
Restores the old username colour and removes the text shadow in forums because the new style is disgusting and hard to read. <b>Now with an option whether to use bold font.</b>

### Update notes
Note that choosing bold will restore it to the way usernames looked before the change. I've thus swapped that to the default, whereas this style originally did not restore the bold typeface.
