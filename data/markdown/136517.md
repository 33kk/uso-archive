### Description
This user style supersedes another, "TitanTV - Clean Wide & Dark" by "r3t3ch", that was rendered less effective (especially the header area) by 3 separate TitanTV.com website updates in 2015 (his user style has not been updated since 2014). The combination of this user style, plus proper ad blocking, makes the site's TV Grid MUCH more readable (less vertical wasted space due to blocked page-wide ad frames) and also more visually appealing - a dark color theme, plus beautiful grid-cell color gradients that reverse light-over-dark --> dark-over-light when hovered. The reasons I find TitanTV's online channel grid to be so good are discussed in my Pastebin posting at http://pastebin.com/ztfzKvs3/. See all 6 screenshots for changes made by this user style, with or without ad blocking. <b>Users must Register, Login, and configure "Site Preferences" GRID DURATION to "6-Hours"!</b> (See Discussion started by P. Baio regarding details).
