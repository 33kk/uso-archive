### Description
This style is meant to be used alongside an ad blocker addon such as ABP, or uBlock.

Anime News Network pages use annoyingly huge ads, larger than the actual content. However hiding them with an ad blocker or other method (in specific, hiding `.left.gutter` and `.right.gutter`) presents a different layout problem:
The article content is displayed in a narrow space on the left side of the page and there is a huge amount of empty space to the right of it. This script narrows the page content (to 1280px), centers them, and removes the empty space.
