### Description
Just a quick style I made to make HN a bit more readable for me. Thanks to Serkan Hosca style 22794 since I used part of his code for the color scheme. Not sure about anyone else but I can skim through text much faster on a big monitor when the text is centered in this style.

### Update notes
Update:

- Removed imgur background for a single color so as not to be dependent on 3rd party
- fixed comment margins. Sorry, haven't used this style in a while and just noticed the issue.
