### Description
Change the look of Firefox navigation toolbar buttons. Only for large icons mode.
Compatible with Australis (Firefox 29).

### Update notes
Inspired by the shiny style 39995. 
And the obvious contrast between the new tabs and the old-style buttons.

This style is for Windows only - Firefox 4 on Linux treats buttons differently and I can't test on Macs, so I don't know if it will work (probably not).

I'm using the same selectors of the default theme, so this style should handle extension buttons the same way as the default (if the button looks odd/broken with the default theme, this style will NOT fix it). Anyway, if you see some button that doesn't look OK, tell me in the "Discussions" section below.
