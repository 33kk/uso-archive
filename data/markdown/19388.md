### Description
This style removes most of the ads displayed on the site http://www.zf.ro, increases the layout width to 1400px and fonts to 16px.

The end result is a quite dramatic improvement in the site's readability which should be its focus, since it is a newspaper site.

Only works for the article view, homepage is catastrophically broken for now.
