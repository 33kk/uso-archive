### Description
I bring you NEOGAF / GAF for the colorblind! Makes GAF 93.5% monochromatic (save for thread/table images) and reduces a ton of superfluous space throughout the layout. Refer to the screenshots below to see how much fluff was trimmed.

Works A-OK in Opera, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

List of Changes:
==========
Header is compressed and reorganized;
fixed max and min-width;
Tabs are restyled to be rectangular and larger;
New thread/reply button reduced and made inline with tabs;
Larger fonts for those with olden eyes and/or high-res monitors;
automatically resizes images to 1000px width, with a rollover to reveal full size (code gratuitously swiped from style 14636. thanks!;
and more!

I have included two 'features' that you can choose to include below - Hide Avatars and Hide Ad-Box.

### Update notes
Updated 11/19/2011 in light of changes to VB Bulletin
Updated 12/07/2011 to fix horrible CSS coding for edited posts.
Updated 03/29/2012 to make room for additional community tabs. Also, allowed users to decide on whether to have adblocking or avatar blocking built into the stylesheet.
Updated 03/30/2012 to take advantage of new community subforums for gaming and OT. Also fixed some long-standing bugs, including stretched grayscale logo and black VBMenu backgrounds (yuck).
