### Description
This user style removes all of the ads (those that I've found) and annoying elements (Cool New People, Featured Artist, etc...) that appear on myspace.com that distract you or inhibit you while you use myspace.com. I've taken care not to interfere with the userâ€™s ability to continue to use the site normally. I plan to continuously update this style for ads that are created by profile generators. If there are any questions, suggestions or issues, please refer to:

http://userstyles.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=164

That is where you will get the best support. If you have the time, please rate this user style.

Changelog
---------------
2.0.0
- Code now better reflects changes to MySpace.
- Fixed issue with Firefox 3 Beta 5 still showing ads on the login page.
