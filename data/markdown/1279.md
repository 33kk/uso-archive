### Description
This stylesheet changes the way notes are displayed, instead of having the reply form below the original note, this stylesheet removes the note list on the left and places the form to the right of the original note (see the image below).

**Updated May 1st 2009: It is now applied to the Sent Items folder too (though the link still points back to the inbox, I might fix that later)
**Updated April 21st 2009: Updated to work in new version of dA. Additionally, you no longer need the Greasemonkey script, I've rewritten the CSS so it's no longer needed.
