### Description
A customizable dark scrollbar to accompany the Dark-10 theme for Google Chrome or simply as a standalone scrollbar.
The default settings and the buttons were made to replicate the colour scheme and shapes from the dark Windows 10 theme.

FULLY WORKING ON YOUTUBE since April 26, 2019.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Dark-10-theme-for-Google-Chrome/master/Dark-10-Scrollbar.user.css">Install style as UserCSS</a> using Stylus or xStyle for live customization.

The full theme is available on <a href="https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Dark-10-theme-for-Google-Chrome">Github</a> and the Google Chrome theme is available on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-10/baebencgofnhbdimnijacljeoegbokeh">Chrome Web Store</a>.

### Update notes
RESTRICTIONS:

Works with CHROME, OPERA, BRAVE and the new EDGE (any chromium-based browser that allows a userstyles or usercss extension).

DOESN'T WORK WITH FIREFOX! 
(And there's nothing I can do about that. Look elsewhere. Github and the FirefoxCSS Reddit are good places to start. Here's my own Firefox CSS repo <a href="https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Firefox-userChrome-minor-tweaks">on Github</a>.)

The scrollbar will show everywhere, sometimes even where it's supposed to be hidden. There's no way around it with CSS alone. If you don't think it's still worth it, this scrollbar is not for you.

VERSION HISTORY:

Version 2.3.0 (2020/01/27)
*I noticed that sometimes, scrollbars are smaller than their buttons/arrows. To make this customization possible, I added separate values for button border sizes.

Version 2.2.1 (2020/01/24)
*Rebranded from "Windows 10 Dark" to "Dark-10" for consistency. I had a copyright strike on the assorted chrome theme in August for using the Windows name.

Version 2.2 (2020/01/24)
* To fix some radius issues when using a rounded scrollbar with borders on, I added perpendicular border sizes. I also removed the additionnal border colour options because (although full customizability is this bar's motto) it would almost always look terrible when used inside a webpage.

Version 2.1.3 (2019/04/26)
* Fixed fullscreen mode on Youtube.

Version 2.1.2 (2019/01/17)
* A recent update on Youtube made the bar appear even in fullscreen. To prevent this, I completely disabled it on the website (at least for now).

Version 2.1 (2018/12/04):
* Buttons are now SVG, so they can be resized without any blur and can be customized.
* Buttons are embedded in base64 (which means that they don't have to load).

Version 2.0 (2018/11/30):
* Customization options
* Buttons (their colour cannot be customized, but they can be hidden)
* Set default settings to match Windows 10 File Explorer
