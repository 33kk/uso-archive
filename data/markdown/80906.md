### Description
This style tries to preserve as much of the page's styling as possible, but fixes any form elements that are not readable if the user has a dark color scheme (eg: dark violet and sky blue, white on black, etc).

For cases where the background is changed, but the foreground isn't, the style will try to apply the best color to the foreground (usually black).
For cases where the foreground is changed, but the background isn't, the style will try to use your operating system's text color for button text.
