### Description
I created the style with a 19" wide screen monitor, so you will have to adjust for other screen sizes.   If you want to take full advantage of this style, increase the number of results that Google displays to 100.  You can change this using Settings, located in the upper right hand corner of Google search webpages.  This requires that you disable Google instant results.  To change the number of columns displayed change the following 3s to 2s.

#res.med > div {  -moz-column-count: 3 !important; }

#rso { -moz-column-count: 3 !important; }

This style removes the new Google sidebar and includes a fixed navigation bar located in the top right hand corner of the browsing window.

This style benefits from multi-column view featured in http://userstyles.org/styles/18639, as well as removing the side bar featured in http://userstyles.org/styles/11373.
