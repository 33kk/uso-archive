### Description
see screenshots

tested on ff2/3 (works on anything with a tree, see comment)

Updates:
removed "anonymous" node colour (it makes everything red for xml docs)
re-added "anonymous" node colour (i dont use domi on xml files usually, but if you do than you may want to remove that line)
selected item bold (thanks Paulfox)
added colour for "PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE"
added colour for "ACCESSIBLE_NODE"
cleaned it up a bit
changed the hover and selected colours

there's a bunch of other nodes, but i don't know what they're used for
ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE
ENTITY_NODE
DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE
NOTATION_NODE
example: treechildren:-moz-tree-cell-text(CDATA_SECTION_NODE){color:red!important}

there's also
ELEMENT_NODE (leftside items in DOMi)
ATTRIBUTE_NODE (rightside items)

if anyone wants the domi edit dialog wider
dialog#editInsertAttribute{width:60em!important}
