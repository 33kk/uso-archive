### Description
Restyles Australis Theme completely.
+Applies transparency gradient to the whole theme  +Square Tab  +Optional Inverted (White) Icons  +Some other options

### Update notes
Tested & Created with FF 7 + Australis 1.1 by SoapyHamHocks http://soapyhamhocks.deviantart.com/


To get the same results as on the screenshots set all options to "YES". 

Since this is the first style that I have created it may contain useless lines of code that I have taken from other styles, although I tried to keep it as clean as possible.
If you still find some or recognize bugs or have any questions, wishes or suggestions please tell me so.

UPDATE [11.11.11] : Square top corners of the Navigation Bar
.

Required:
- Australis Theme https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/australis/versions/?page=1#version-1.1


Recommended:
- style 5546
- style 42417
- Addon: Omnibar (Combine Search- & Adressbar; 1-letter-shortcuts for every searchengine) https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/omnibar/
- Addon: Fastdial (Startpage; use my link if addons.mozilla.org version doesn't work) http://cl.ly/AVFu/fast_dial-3.5.1-fx-modified.xpi
- Addon: Personal Menu (Dropdown bookmarks + history menu) https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/personal-menu/
- Addon: Toolbar Appmenu Button https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/toolbar-appmenu-button/ (to remove extra space at left side of the tabs use #TabsToolbar{margin-left: -4px !important})


Notes:
- All inverted Icons are stored in the Australis Theme as files, all greyscale Icons are embeded so this style should work with all current releases of FF
- Still need to change the color of the right part of the appmenu and the seperators to gray
- if someone gives me the code to make the Sidebar transparent I'll add it
- the wallpaper you see on the screenshot is "TV kills everything Standby Version" by jthree; the Win7 Visual Style is Shine 2.0 by zainadeel
