### Description
<code>[11/2014] Broken, don't install.
      Feel free to take the code and fix it if you want to.</code>

For the Web and Images search on Google.com.
A dark grey style that allows better focus on content. Secondary interface elements are low-contrast while the content elements are more contrasted.


PLEASE NOTE: This theme is pretty broken in places and I don't intend to fix it. Google sites are a real pain to theme thanks to their obscure naming schemes. And due to my being inexperienced with CSS when I began this style, fixing it would require rewriting most parts from scratch. Also I don't use Google Search anymore anyway. Still this style works for now.

### Update notes
Limitations:
- Doesn't work on regional versions of Google because many of them are stuck with old interface versions.
- Google Plus notifications thing is hidden by default because I was too lazy to fix it.

10/29/13: lazy top frame fix
