### Description
Youtube's design is getting worse and worse, in this style I try to make it look as closer to the classic
white design. It also gives you the option to block youtube ads(in-video as well), as youtube intended to be before Google owned it.


Update 09/07/13:
-Fixing it for the new site
-Removed the user name the google notifications from top
-Overall made slimmer
-Changed almost all text to real black!(they had some weird dark grey)
-The title is top again (and it should stay there!)
-Very nice and slim search button
-Most of the buttons are now borderless and backgoundless, as in earlier youtube versions
-Header is white

Update 08/11/12:
-removed "More recommended videos" box that appears on popular 3-rd party videos.
-Feature: Block Ads added (off by default).
