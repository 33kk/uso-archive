### Description
Piggy backed from Xen Minimal Curvy Neon so not all new code, new code is at the bottom.
Right at the bottom of the code is the following:

/********** Adjust width below according to username length **********/

.formPopup .primaryControls input.textCtrl {
    width: 70px;
}

Adjust the width of the Quicksearch bar depending on username length.

### Update notes
This is a work in progress, there may well be some elements that are still dark, I will fix these as I find them.
