### Description
Customize your own background for google basic search, suitable for use as your home page. Extraneous elements are hidden or auto-hidden. Works in Firefox and Chrome. Should work for most international sites - let me know of problems.

Due to frequent Google changes the top bar is completely auto-hidden for now - I may leave it that way. Hover over the top right area to see it, but text and icons don't look good.

<b>"Google Instant predictions" must be turned off in your search settings.</b> On the Google home page, click on "Settings", then "Search Settings".

My intention is to only include www.google.com and international equivalents (not search results, image search, etc.)
