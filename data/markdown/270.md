### Description
For those of you using "SMALL icons" in toolbar/statusbar, these avoid the whole "roach / no roach / old vs new / etc"  drama.  Intuitive "green for on, red for off;"  I simply created slightly smaller 14x14 icons to make "crisper," line up better with other icons (especially Stylish icon in StatusBar) and drastically reduce the amount of base 64 code necessary..  Switching to "large icons" will simply default to the standard 0.7 "roach" type.  Also, THIS version will work in your userChrome should you decide to commit this script to chrome.
