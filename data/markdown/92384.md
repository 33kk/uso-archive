### Description
This addon is simple but <strong>really helpful</strong> to have, if you listen to Google Music on the computer.
<p>
You can now read the full artist bio without having to click the "Read More" button. No more ridiculous popup window! You can read the Artist Bio without having to squint your eyes within the insanely cumbersome white popup window!
</p><p>
The FULL ARTIST BIO and ALBUM DESCRIPTION are now <strong>seamlessly scrollable</strong>. The font starts out smaller, and when you mouse-over the artist/album info the text size increases, and a vertical scrollbar appears when needed.</p>
<p>
I might add a feature to make it easier to change the font size, or to let you bring back the button (which still works, it just serves no purpose in my eyes). <i>All the CSS is already in there, with comments so it should already be REALLY easy to modify if you want to change anything.</i></p>
