### Description
If neither the Back nor the Forward button is active this script removes the dropdown arrow that's usually displayed on the right-hand side of the Back/Forward buttons.

user 7743's script style 6559 already does the job permanently. However, if you want the dropdown arrow to be visible when there's at least one of the Back/Forward buttons active try this script instead of Dman's.
