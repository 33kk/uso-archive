### Description
This style removes all the ads on Joystiq.com. It reduces everything into a one column format while still maintaining basic site functuality. Videos and images are made smaller in some of the stories to provide better readability. "Whited-out" or "down-voted" comments for each story could be made visible by hovering over them with your mouse.

Changelog 
v2 (03.22.2009):
Hovering over the small images in the article will resize the image to 100%, allowing you to see the image with more clarity and read what is on it. Not sure why I didn't do that before, but at least now it's possible.
