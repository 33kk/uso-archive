### Description
<strong>Easy on the Eyes</strong>
<p>RES Friendly!</p>
<p><strong><em>UPDATED 2017: Catching up with fixes and tweaks!</em></strong></p>
<p>For those late nights on reddit! Dark slate tones and subtle hues for low contrast redditing, takes it easy on those tired eyes. </p>
<p>Please note that this is a VERY low-contrast theme by design! </p>

<p><strong>Style Conflicts?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to disable some custom reddit styles if there are ugly conflicts by going to <u>Reddit Preferences -> Display options and uncheck "allow reddits to show me custom styles"</u>.</li>
<li>Disable RES's night-theme; this style is not compatible with it.</li>
</ul>
