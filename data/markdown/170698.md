### Description
This is a pure CSS transliteration of names and agencies on the main vote page for PRODUCE X 101 located at http://produce-x-101.mnet.com/pc/vote

This is only for that specific page, and the ranking page as of version 1.0.0, and does not provide transliterations or translations for anything besides the traineesâ€™ names and agencies. To avoid confusion, I used the spellings on their profiles on this site.

This is built off of my previous theme for PRODUCE48 which can be found here:
