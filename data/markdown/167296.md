### Description
Its no secret that the Youtube comments are crap, but when a Youtube comment is so bad that it sometimes <b>vaguely relates to the video itself</b>, or <b>has been commented thousands of times on that video before you,</b> that's when you have a slight problem. This userstyle hides Justin Y's comments on YouTube, allowing you to read the comments without being pestered by his shit.
