### Description
this style is defined as global due to the visibility. the style restyles only light <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCaptchas</a> to the dark theme equivalent.

it also shows a little note in the bottom left corner. so you know that this reCapatcha is originaly configured with a light theme. "reCaptcha light as dark"

<a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display">reCaptcha Docs - option for dark theme - see the 'g-recaptcha tag attributes and grecaptcha.render parameters' table</a>

<a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo">reCaptcha - api2 - Demo</a>

as the new invisble mechanism does not provide a dark theme. I am testing to override these new mostly invisible captcha eye-catcher.
