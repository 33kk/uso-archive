### Description
Showing elements hidden by this style:

Each group of styles has a comment ahead of it, noting what it does, and one below it, the title of the next group. To disable a group of styles, eg to un-hide the "Quote" link, simply add "/*" (without quotes) after its header. 

For example, to show avatars, change the line that looks like: "/* hide avatars */" to "/* hide avatars */ /*".
