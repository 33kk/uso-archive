### Description
This style hides the labels for all the bookmarks in the personal toolbar except for folders (smart bookmarks add-on like). 
The labels are dynamic, showing up by sliding to the right when hovering an icon.
It also makes the personal toolbar thinner, saving some vertical space.
If you want to make the labels also dynamic for folders just delete " :not([container="true"]) "  from the code!

Thanks dert07 and foxxyn8 for the help with this!

Updates:
10/6/10 - Fixed the code so it will still work if you move the bookmarks from the bookmark toolbar to a different toolbar.
