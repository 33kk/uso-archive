### Description
As with all custom styles - disable "allow subreddits to show me custom styles" in your reddit preferences.

This is compatible with RES. However RES has its own skin settings that don't mix well - disable the entire "style tweaks" section under the UI tab, or else a few minor misalignment's will happen.
