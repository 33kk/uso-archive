### Description
I liked the sidebar created by Martin Brook (http://userstyles.org/styles/13947) for the sidebar version of Checkvist, but I wanted to make a few tweaks. First I added the recolored version of checkvist (http://userstyles.org/styles/18686). Secondly (and more importantly) I kept the list dropdown at the top of the page. I also added the "undo" functionality back to the script. This is a very important feature, and some people may not know all of the keyboard shortcuts. 

Anyway, here is a tip to make sure you get this working. First, bookmark a list, not the checkvist dashboard. If you bookmark the dashboard you will not be able to open lists in your sidebar -- it will open in the main page. Second, even though you are bookmarking a list, it is now very easy to switch lists by clicking "ll". The dropdown will appear and you will be able to navigate between your lists. 

Hope you find this helpful!
