### Description
Quick-and-dirty hide of everything I don't need to see when looking for information on a book (does not work as well on non-book pages).

I also rearranged things so the basic book info (pub date, ISBN, #pages) makes it above the fold. Unfortunately some item pages end up with overlapping sections, but they're rare enough that I'm not going to worry about it. I just disable the style when looking at those pages. Feel free to comment if you figure out something that works everywhere. 

If Amazon is still too slow for you, try Amazon Mobile and style 5883:
