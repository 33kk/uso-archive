### Description
Based on the work of gazugafan with its Netvibes Dark theme (thanks to her/him!).
Works best coupled with a dark Netvibes theme, such as Blackmamba, Darkvibes (pictured), or Exposition Pepper.
Tested/made compatible with the following essential apps from Netvibes:
- Calculator (inverted colors)
- Calendar
- E-mail
- Gmail
- Google News
- Reddit
- Wikipedia
- Youtube Search
And more...



Feel free to contact me for comments/suggestions.
