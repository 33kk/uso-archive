### Description
The MLB scoreboard page displays a lot of crap that you probably don't care about.  Team challenges, the sidebar, the top ads and top nav.  The page does not have a fluid layout and limits the display to 3 columns of games.  This style fixes that.  It makes the page very clean and flexible.
