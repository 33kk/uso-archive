### Description
On some Windows machines the Lucida Sans font seems to be rendered poorly, which can make NewsBlur hard to read. This can be addressed locally by adding Lucida Sans Unicode as the first named font, which renders correctly in Windows. OSX users should still be served Lucida Sans as the second named font.
