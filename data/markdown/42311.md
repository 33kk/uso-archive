### Description
Removed invalid CSS properties and converted them to CSS3 valid properties. Made comment "points" red to stand out, comments now alternate between shades of gray and white with rounded corners.

This is basically a combination of a few styles on this site already, I just merged them into 1 style and did some minor fixes.
