### Description
Like the title says^^

Applies on every website & changes as much as possible, <s>also elements like scrollbars, buttons, cursors or the right-click menu to fit with the dark style (best result after Firefox restart).</s> No longer possible since FF57+

I'm sorry if it doesn't work good on your website but it's just not possible to make it look good everywhere. But I try my best to do so :)


Easy customizeable with your own background. Just edit the style and paste the image-url.


Now you can also exclude websites! Just edit the style and look at the bottom for something like "applies to - URLs with regular expression".
Replace/add 'www.your.sites.here.com' with your desired ones.
So it can look like
<code>https?://(?!(www.youtube.com|www.google.com|userstyles.org|forum.xda-developers.com)).*</code>

For some help with changing the background and excluding sites also take a look <a href="http://abload.de/image.php?img=excludeurlsg2uwu.png">here</a>
