### Description
Show the world the only thing that is worthy of sitting atop your tumblr dashboard. It's not a hut, it's not a castle and it's certainly not a crummy crown! Well, yes, it is a crown. It's just a really nice one. Image credit goes to jee juh. Thanks jee juh! Tumblr dashboard icon replacement. Have fun!
