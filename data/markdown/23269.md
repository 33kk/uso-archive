### Description
Spymaster Advanced Intel and Tracking System (AITS) is a site created by Spymaster player @podcasting101 to collect gameplay "intelligence" on opponents, record game activity, and chat/socialize with other players. It's a great site if you love the game, but the chat widget is wonky and not very useful. Moreover it often crashes my browser. This style will remove the chat widget.
