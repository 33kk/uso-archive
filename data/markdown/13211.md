### Description
The idea here is to use minimum real estate used for the Status Toolbar, and other toolbars, so that you have more screen space to use your browser for it's intended purpose of looking at web pages not space hogging toolbars and graphics

Firefox 4 has added a keyboard shortcut ( Ctrl+/ )  to hide/show the addons bar.

Firefox 4 fixed height of addons/status bar on 2011-02-17 hope it stays fixed, with the possible exception of addons that break 16x16 size rules,  but changes still require the Status-4-Evar extension anyway to maintain sanity, see http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/status4evar.htm

For best viewing of  style before/after images use style 12373 (12373), which will attempt to show both before and after in their correct size, reducing size only if necessary.
