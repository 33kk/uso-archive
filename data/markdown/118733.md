### Description
Cleans up G2A by removing the annoying ad background and cleaning up a lot of the interface that the average user doesn't use. I made this because the ad background drove me crazy, and while I was at it, I went ahead and removed some more annoyances.

### Update notes
Features:
v1.0:
-Removed ad background (no more click)
-Made background changable
-Cleaned up interface
