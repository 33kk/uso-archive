### Description
Repositions and recolors elements on the delicious.com redesign to line everything up and make it more scannable. Builds on style 10830 by user 15152, which switches the positions of the tags and the edit/delete links. This lines everything up a little better by removing the gray bar & lock icon from private links and giving them a light blue background instead. It also removes the background images on the tags and makes those links blue (they were difficult to see without the background). In addition, it bolds the link titles.

Doesn't break anything on the other pages, but they could probably be a little nicer; let me know if you have suggestions!
