### Description
Well...lets face it, the inselkampf world 2 style is hardly colourful. This style changes that. It isn't quite right yet, and the navigation doesn't *quite* line up with the content, but it's nicer than the original. No major layout change, so it should be easy to adapt to. I must warn the screenshots are very bad quality-sorry about that. Some colours don't show up quite right, and some even show a change of colour where there is none. You should be able to get a rough idea of looks however.

I will be updating this style and providing different variants of it fairly regularly.
