### Description
Increases length of Facebook notifications dropdown list to 85% of the viewport height and (optionally) removes profile pics and timestamps to show many more Facebook notifications at once without scrolling. Increases contrast of read vs. unread notifications to make them easier to distinguish. Fully annotated so you can remove any unwanted features (for example, you may prefer to leave the timestamps visible). Applies to "URLs on the domain Facebook.com".
