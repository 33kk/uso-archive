### Description
<b>Discontinuation notice:</b> I'm not using this anymore and it only semi-works with the new ISIS style, so i'm not going to work on it anymore. If someone wants to take it over, feel free to message me here. Personally, i've started using the `Dark Reader` browser extesion and it does an okay-ish job IMO. Maybe i'll redo this at some point.

Dark and clean skin for the ISIS forum system of the TU Berlin
