### Description
Removes the annoying and space-hogging favicons in Firefox's bookmark toolbar. Does not remove them from drop-down folders etc. in the toolbar or from tabs!

Also works in Pale Moon browser and with newer versions of Firefox than pictured in the screenshots.

### Update notes
Does what the old 'bookmarks deiconizer' script did, complete with margin adjustments, without the bugginess caused by the extension. Tested up to Firefox 30, should work in all or most versions as well as Pale Moon (a Firefox derivative).
