### Description
Install at your own risk, may break things...
WEBKIT ONLY FOR NOW (Chrome and Safari)

• Sets left 'dashboard' to fixed position, so it doesn't move whilst you scroll.
• Sets all the Twitter copyright stuff to hidden until you move your mouse over.
• Sets 'Trends' to list side-by-side, to save space. Truncated links are displayed using ellipses (...) (NB this may mean that some longer trends don't display their full text, though this can be seen in the URL that is displayed in the status-bar when you hover over the link.)
