### Description
I wanted to experiment a little with some alternative colors - and as I've always liked the idea of dark and black websites, I chose to do that. Additionally there is the old skill colors which many users might find nice. Hope someone enjoy it! :-)

What's new?

1.1:

- Fixed the white box in the bottom problem
- Tactics work better now (and conductional orders may be viewed properly)
- Fixt writing messages problem (unable to watch what you were writing)
- And lots of other annoying things too which I don't remember :P 

1.2:

- Improved front page
- Propably some more ;-)

1.2.1:

- You're now able to actually see what you're bidding (while it forced me to change some other things too...)

1.2.2:

- Fixed press releases

1.3:

- Added colors in match report
- This propably forced me to change some other things too (I don't remember whether it did or not as I tried to make some things look better by changing some colors a few times)

1.3.1:

- Changed LR color in leage fixtures from dark grey to white.
- Moved a } to the end of the document so there now shouldn't be any chance that it will cause changes in other sites.

1.3.2:

- I thought I fixed press releases earlier, but it seems there can be up to 10 of them. Fixed.

1.4:

- Fixed translator interface!
- Improved youth age colors!
- Improved match colors :) 

1.4.1:

- Fits to the new stylesheet for FK.
- Improved demotion and promotion lines in fixtures.

1.4.2:

- Fixed the front page
- Langauge selector included

1.4.3:

- Edited language selector further - now it fits better to the rest of the design

1.4.4:

- The style no longer applies for the forum

1.4.5:

- With yet another update for the main page, I had to update the style as well. However, parts of the menu will take some time to correct.

1.4.6:

- Removed a couple of annoying images which recieved new names with one of the earlier style updates. My css code, however, is completely messed up atm, so I'll reboot soon and, most importantly, add comments in the code...
