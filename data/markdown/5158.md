### Description
After upgrading to Vista and wanting to vomit at all the twinkling shiny 3d jazzy crap on everything... (but liking the transparency), I decided I was going to have to strip down Firefox and Thunderbird, and make for grey backgrounds, in order to live with them. I wanted things to look super clean, and flat like they were painted on the glass with a bare minimum of 3d effects and highlights. I tried a lot of other "basic" and "clean" themes for Firefox but there was always something annoying plus my idea of basic makes a basic theme look flashy.

Plus I hate this godawful baby blue that is everywhere in Vista.

I don't even want 3d borders on text boxes and my tabs are just square bricks. That's intended :(. Call me ancient school.

So far so good. If this is up your alley try it out. This is my first time making stuff so the code is not the most pretty and it is still a bit of a work in progress. If you have things to add I am happy for anything. I have a similar thing going for Thunderbird making it dark blue.

I based this on FF3 dark background by DigDug. It was really helpful and without it I'd never know how to begin. I mostly then just stripped things down, set colors, moved layout items 

If you want to use this, other stuff that goes nicely with it are:
