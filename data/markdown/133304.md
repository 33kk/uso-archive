v.2.7 UPDATE! New option to use version 2 for Lesson Edit! This moves the Next/Previous buttons to the right side of the page numbers. (for the lessons with more than 9 pages, this is really necessary.)

v.2.8 New! I am just now releasing a new part for this edit, called 'Home Pages Width Edit -beta' This release makes the home pages (message board, webmail, home, etc.) fill the width of the page more. This really helps for webmail and message-boards.

v.3.0 New! Lesson Edit 3 is here! Now with Sliding Tree*! Sliding Tree is a new method of accessing the course tree, now hover to reveal the tree.

<li>Lessons are now more easily read, with the content now in a larger view, and the course tree is now sliding, with Lesson Edit 3 in settings (use V2 if not wanted)</li>
------<li>------*Sliding Tree was created by Kevin Brown in his Connexus Modern v2, and some other parts of my style were inspired by him. Thank you, Kevin.-----</i>-----
v.3.1 More! Now an additional 30px vertical space available for lesson content. +Fixed Honor Code text being the wrong color. :)

v3.2 New! A new look for the lessons, as you scroll down the page, the top should scroll behind the title! PLEASE REPORT ANY ISSUES!! -I know the Life Management course is already scrolled up, I left it that way on purpose, if you think it should be changed, please say so :)

v.3.3 Enhanced the lesson overflow at the top so it is now more seamless. :)

v.3.4 Fixed some animations on the Home page, and added a shadow :)

v3.5 Changed some spacing for lesson edit V3. Now you will no longer accidentally open the Sliding Tree when marking a lesson done!

v3.6 New! Added new looks to the homepage, (will be improved soon)

v3.7 Fixed a glitch in sub-lesson courses, like web design, where the alternate page change buttons did not work right.

v3.8 Added a course placement expanion option so you can more easily look through available classes.

v3.9 Added a fix for a message board overflow issue. This issue is new this year and caused by issues when the administration posts a new thread. (It wasn't caused by me)

v4 Decreased course catalogue list spacing to view more classes at once.

V4.1 Fixed Learning Coach homepage tabs, now properly aligned!
