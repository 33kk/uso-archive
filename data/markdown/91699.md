### Description
Tumblr dashboard theme, with custom 'new post' icons.

"<i>Chatoyancy occurs on gemstones with parallel orientated inclusions, like fibers, needles and hollow tubes. The effect of the reflection on these is a light streak which runs at a 90Â° angle over the inclusions. In order for this effect to be seen, the gemstone needs to be cut en-cabochon.

Naming these types of gemstones is generally done with the suffix Cat's-Eye, as in Alexandrite Cat's-Eye.</i>" <sup><a href="http://gemologyproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sheen#Chatoyancy">*</a></sup>
