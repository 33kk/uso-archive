### Description
A lot of work went into this - if you appreciate it, please support my work.



v1.1

hides controls, saves screen space
many transparent elements, all of which go opaque on hover (including street view!)
based on ChoGGi's script at http://userstyles.org/styles/3520
fixes MANY bugs (including the infamous marker-page-movement bug), looks neater, adds lots of sexy transparency, hover effects and rounded elements.
try it out!
designed to match my rounded dialogs theme - http://userstyles.org/styles/6601

the images are the same height if you open them: try these links:
