### Description
This is a similar style to another style created by me ( style 8711 ), but it remove the Google bar on the top and move the search area and Google Notebook icon to there. Therefore, it has a larger editing area.

This style is for my screen, which is 1024 x 768. If you have a larger screen, you can remove  
table.p div#gn0_5 {width:200px !important;}
table.p div#gn0_6 {width:800px !important;}
or change to the variable whatever you like.

'08 7/31 updated: fix the width of toolbar.
'08 10/28 updated: remove #gn0_5 {width:200px !important;} , since it will ruin the small window.
'08 11/3 updated: Use a better way to fix the small window. Therefore, the full window view has a larger editing area now.
'08 11/24 updated: Add comments and change some margin and padding of the areas.
