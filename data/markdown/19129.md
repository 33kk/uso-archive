### Description
**This will be the only version of this I imagine, I don't think I'll update after today (2.7.09).**

This is a combination of expanded Twitter, show all followers, and my own black version of the site.  Enjoy?  Or don't.  Just sharing.

I just realized this isn't going to work for most people, just me and my friends.  Most people aren't going to be able to see their tweets with this style, so sorry.
