### Description
I started using the mobile version of Facebook (m.facebook.com) on my desktop computer to avoid all of the clutter and crashes in the latest version.  This style makes it feel more like a desktop site with more padding and horizontal layout of some elements.  It also removes the Call buttons and fixes a few bugs in the site.
