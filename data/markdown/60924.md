### Description
A simple userstyle to change the font in the Simplenote textarea to font-family:monospace. Defaults to the CSS font-size "medium" property, but allows selecting other sizes from the drop-down picker.

### Update notes
Tested working with Firefox 9.x (with and without Stylish) and Chromium 16.something (without Stylish) on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick. (<strong>Update:</strong> Re-tested with Firefox Nightly 28.0a1 and Chromium 30.0.1599.114 both using the latest Stylish extension on Ubuntu 12.04.) A happy Valentine's Day gift to the Simplenote users who have been <a href="http://help.simplenoteapp.com/customer/portal/questions/57081-mono-spaced-font">requesting this feature</a> for a while.

The Simplenote web app's borders in the screenshot have been removed by <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/40848/simplenote-remove-border">this userstyle</a>. Also seen in this screenshot: the Resurrect Pages, Pinboard.in, and Omnibar Firefox extensions, plus the DuckDuckGo search plugin. <strong>Update 2013-11-23: still works after Automattic acquisition and iOS 7-ish redesign.</strong>  

If this style helps you out and you feel like <strong>externalizing your joy by giving away some money</strong>, please consider <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/">donating to the Mozilla Foundation</a>, the creators of the Firefox web browser, without which I couldn't have created this style. (Okay, <a href="http://getfirebug.com/contribute">Firebug</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish">Stylish</a> helped, too.)
