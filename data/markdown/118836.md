### Description
Really wanted a clean dark theme, but no good ones that I liked existed. Created this and realized how easy (and a bit of a pain) it was to make one. This includes a slightly modified <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/2437/tb-twistermc-s-make-tb-labels-stand-out" target="_blank">Twister's Labels</a>. Hope you enjoy!

### Update notes
<strong>RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong>
- Install a simple dark theme with white icons (I'm using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/dark-black/" target="_blank">Dark Black</a> by rtodorovsky)
- Don't forget to change link colors for folders from Options > Options > Display > Colors...

<strong>FEEDBACK:</strong>
Greatly encouraged, I'm sure there are some bugs. You should treat this as v0.1 for now.

<strong>NOTES:</strong>
<em>Window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close) are controlled by OS and I'm currently using Windows 10. Your mileage will vary in that section based on your OS.</em>
