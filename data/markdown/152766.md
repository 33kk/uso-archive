### Description
<p> A dark theme for qBittorrent's webui. This theme was made and tested using qBittorrent 4.0's webui in Chrome and probably won't look as nice with previous versions (due to the new icon set included in the 4.0 release). To use this userstyle you will need to manually enter the address of your qBittorrent webui.</p>

<p>To make this theme I started with Techjar's "Dark Web UI for qBittorrent"(<a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/139837/dark-web-ui-for-qbittorrent"> https://userstyles.org/styles/139837/dark-web-ui-for-qbittorrent</a>) as a base and made many adjustments and additions from there.</p>
