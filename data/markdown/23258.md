### Description
Gives the avatars on the RuneScape forums a size from the moment the page loads.

This means that the length of the page doesn't keep suddenly changing as more avatars load, making skimming through numerous pages of a thread significantly less annoying since you can easily click the 'Next' button without it moving.
