### Description
<> Firstly, It gets rid of the awful orange background.
<> It also gets rid of all the ads and the 'Did You Know' box and other useless stuff like that. 
<> The 'Now Playing' box gets moved next to the search bar so its out of the way. 
<> It changes it so that there is always only two columns instead of three.
*Hope you like this.

-This is a mashup of the DeOranged style plus my own fixes.
