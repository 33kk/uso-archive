### Description
Reskins 4chan from the old colors of blue and orange to a simple black, keep in mind that this can make telling a Yotsuba B and a Yotsuba board more difficult and the skinner takes no responsibility for you getting banned posting something you shouldn't.  By now most users can tell which board is which anyway, but the point still stands.

Keep in mind that I fix and update skins based on when I notice that they might need updating, or something is wrong. However, I don't always upload the results immediately (and sometimes the results get lost entirely). Please pardon my slowness in updates from time to time.
