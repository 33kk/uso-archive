### Description
Images must be 76x23 and using the upload option won't work: it must be a link. You must also fill all of the image textboxes for this to be able to install, but it doesn't matter what you fill them with since it will only effect the twitch username "username".

The padding option depends on your username. Every letter removed from a username adds about 5px to the padding. 13 characters or more should be set to 0 (I haven't tested it so if it's more than 13 you may need to put a negative multiple of 5), and if it's less than 13, add 5 for each less character. examples: 13 characters=0, 12 characters=5, 11 characters=10, 10 characters=15, 6 characters=35, etc.
