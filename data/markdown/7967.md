### Description
This is a very simple script - It takes the Schlock Mercenary site and removes everything that isn't the comic and the nav bar. It pins the nav bar in the upper-left corner of the page for easy access.

It does not work correctly without Adblock enabled and blocking the Blank Label Comics SWF floater in the upper-right and the Project Wonderful banner. I can't see how to remove those with my stylesheet.
