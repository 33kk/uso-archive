### Description
A bit like Gmail/Outlook look&feel, based on chrissi4u's 'CLEAN ADAPTION no1' designed for vertical message view. Note that you will have to adjust the width of the panes for the message list to display correctly AND you should arrange the columns in the following order: STARRED, ATTACHMENTS, SUBJECT, SENDER, DATE, SIZE. Or you can experiment with those.
Not guaranteed to work with every window manager.
