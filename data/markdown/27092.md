### Description
This user style is for the Treasure Madness game on Facebook.

I have a lot of incomplete collections, and to find the ones that were complete and ready to be secured with the museum, I got really tired of either keeping them all expanded and scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, or keeping them collapsed and guessing at which one it was.

So I whipped up a user style which would allow me to keep them all collapsed, but still able to see the "secure" button, which makes for much faster scanning of my treasures page.
