### Description
Have a 2k+ screen and want to watch youtube along with other things, but don't want to be limited by the 720p "stagemode"?
this style simply expands the stagemode to display in 1080p instead (at time of writing, youtube's auto quality DOES detect the 1080p, no further changes required for a native resolution)
