### Description
A small set of CSS changes to make Groove Music more usable. Here's what's changed:
<ul>
<li>The player controls (play, pause etc) are on the left next to the album artwork. I found it annoying to be navigating on the left side of the screen then make the long stretch to the right side to hit next.</li>

<li>As a result of the above point, the progress bar for the song has been moved to the right side of the play controls and is longer than default, giving more accuracy to your progress scrubbing.</li>

<li>Removes the "Buy Song" option from the context menu on songs.</li>

<li>Removes the Explicit icon for songs that just looks so out of place and messes up the text aligning.</li>
</ul>
