### Description
For Firefox versions 3.x and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

This is my personal use Bookmark Toolbar and Sidebar userstyle for Firefox. This userstyle allows you to replace folder icons on the Bookmarks Toolbar with ones of your own and shows bookmarks text on hover, Hides useless Toolbar buttons drop-markers on the Bookmarks Toolbar, and the Bookmarks Sidebar contents are moved to the Left-Edge of window.

Tested on Firefox versions 3.x and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.
