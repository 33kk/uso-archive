### Description
This style changes the way photos look on the News Feed, profiles, pages, etc. by putting a white border around it, creating a shadow underneath it and rotating it slightly to make it look as if it were a photograph lying on a desk... or something. Anyway, it looks nice.

Looks best in Firefox.
