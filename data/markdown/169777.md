### Description
Current downloads of dark themes (particularly RYM Tomorrow 2) have illegible sections of text, probably due to not being updated since 2016. Particularly with the text for Artists on their page being far too dark to read and the use of dark purple against the dark grey background on lists. 

All credit for the theme goes to Hajime, I just fixed up the colours across multiple sections of the site. I've had more than a few people request the theme so thought it best to upload it directly to Stylus/Stylish
