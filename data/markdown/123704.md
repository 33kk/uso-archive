### Description
Bm themes are Black Minimalist themes which aim to "flush away" all the extra crap that clogs up your screen and provide a nice truly dark theme.

THIS THEME IS MADE TO BE USED WITH THE FIREFOX THEME "DARK CARBON"!!!

Based on the style by Niklasg, his style was not as dark as I like things and this covers more pages.

Effects:
Firefox url bar (recolors and removes auto-suggest, if you don't like that just delete line 1 or lines 1-5)
about:newtab
about:Privaterowsing
about:config
about:preferences
about:addons (made to be used with "Cleanest Addon Manager" addon set to "Minimal Adaptive" in options. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cam/?src=search )
about:sessionrestore
Most about: pages
Bamboo Feed Reader addon if installed (use with midnight theme)
Tidies up youtube spam (Delete everything after the last 5 spaces at the bottom if you prefer bloated youtube)
