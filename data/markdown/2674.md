### Description
When the Vertigo scheme on LJ was in beta, it had a dark blue sidebar and the default userpic sensibly centered. Now that it has been officially released, the sidebar is light blue and the default userpic tucked into the corner. This stylesheet recreates the original look.

Note that this style *requires* the Greasemonkey script LJClasses (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/10190), which adds a different class name to the body according to the viewing scheme.
