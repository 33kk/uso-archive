### Description
Trims some fat off Firefox's Bookmarks Toolbar items in order to save space. Especially useful if you're one of those people who saves space by moving the Bookmarks Toolbar to the menubar. It works with Firefox 3.6 and above, all the way up to the latest Firefox (48 as of the last time I checked).

As of 2016-09-02, the dropdown settings have been fixed!

Now updated for Firefox 50+ with its altered styling.
