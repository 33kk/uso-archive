### Description
Evening browsing on MyAnimeList often has me squinting, as the pages are way too bright. So I present this style. It's simple, gives it a calm, darker background and makes some parts transparent so it looks a bit nicer.
Also clears up some of the ads. (ads will still be loaded if you don't run AdBlock, but you just won't see them, good for both sides :) )
Nothing too fancy, but hope you'll enjoy!

### Update notes
- Removed a new banner

**********

- First version
- Comments in code, helps clarify parts so you can change it yourself should you want to.
