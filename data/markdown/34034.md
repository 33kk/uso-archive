### Description
Based mostly on max2400's skin (http://userstyles.org/styles/33391), with a few minor changes. The top left menu has now been reduced to a tiny drop down arrow and the tabs are shorter allowing me to nab a few more vertical pixels for browsing.

Worth noting that the favicon bookmarks toolbar was achieved with the smart bookmarks bar extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4072/).

Update:

Very slight change to the position of the favicons within tabs, just made it more verticaly central.
