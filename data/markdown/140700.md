### Description
The standard Farmville Live Chat window is much too short! 

This script hides the YOUR GAMES and RECOMMENDED GAMES sections at the top (do you ever use those?) and makes the Chat window taller.

Change the <i>chat height</i> below or read the <i><b>Notes</b></i> section below if you're not happy with the default Tall Height.

### Update notes
The default value of 540 (pixels) makes the Live Chat window approximately the size of the Farmville display window to the left.

Make the Live Chat window shorter (?) or taller by changing the "chat height" number. Don't make the number Too Tall though, since you need to leave room for the <i>Type a messageâ€¦</i> input prompt and the <b>Send</b> button.

If you get the number wrong, either edit the script or reinstall it for another chance to change the number.
