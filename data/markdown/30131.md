### Description
For the Vector skin (the new default skin in the English Wikipedia as of May 2010), this style makes a few adjustments: less space wasted on top, search bar realigned and widened, and the Wikipedia attribution changed to grey.

Note that the "after" screenshot shows the effect of my three Wikipedia (Vector) styles combined. The changes for this particular style are highlighted by the middle caption.

[Screenshots in grey to save space.]

The other styles shown in the "after" screenshot:
• http://userstyles.org/styles/30132 - limit width
• http://userstyles.org/styles/30133 - old logo

Also available for Vector:
• http://userstyles.org/styles/30188 - expand languages
