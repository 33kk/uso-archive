### Description
This is a dark theme for <b><a href="https://wire.com/">Wire</a></b>, an open source instant messaging and video/voice chat client built around privacy.

I built this theme some months ago entirely within <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus' editing tools</a>, then stopped when I saw talk on its github of them redesigning quite a bit of the sidebar (which was the biggest hurdle at the time).

There shouldn't be any issues with text being illegible, but at the moment the settings, archive, and invite icons on the left do not work. You can switch between conversations normally.
