### Description
The new IC looks awful. This style attempts to improve it. It's still a work in progress, but here's a first version that already DRASTICALLY improves the look and feel.

Features:
- Page width expanded to full width of header/Top Nav
- Removed Facebook Like button from each post
- Removed ads, footer, Fox Menu bar at top, FoxSportsNext logo on nav and more obnoxious stuff
- Changed background color to Carolina Blue
- Added alternating post background color
- Changed Hot Thread Icons to blue
- Many more padding and layout fixes
