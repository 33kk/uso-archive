### Description
The AIOS toolbar component for my Aero (glasser) theme. Looks best with firefox 3.5b4+.

This only edit's the toolbar, didn't mess with the sidebar itself.

Keep in mind whenever you add a new style for the AIOS you have to either restart your browser or right click the toolbar and click "Customize..." for some of the settings to take effect.

The entire Wb Aero Theme:
style 18093
style 19845
style 18094
style 18095
style 18096
style 19844

* Note: the screenshot contains some other components from my Wb Aero theme as well...
