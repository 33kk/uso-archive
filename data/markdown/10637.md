### Description
Mashed a bunch of styles together here to make one MAJORLY COOL style.. Most parts of this theme have been modified so much that they are unrecognisable, but other parts I have just lifted straight out and edited to make it fit.

Because of that, I'll have to thank a few people.

Len for style 7251 - For the awesome rounded address and search bars!!
Falconer for style 10470 - Made me realise that it's possible to have the tabs at the top!
PaulDawson for style 398 - Made the tabs slightly bigger, and the active tab that much better!

And I'm sure there are a few more styles I got some ideas from.. Sorry if I didn't acknowledge you..


What you'll need!!
- A computer..!
- Windows Vista with glass theme enabled
- Firefox 3 >>> http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/
- Glasser >>> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7336
- Stylish >>> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108
- Personal Menu >>> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3895


What you'll need to do..
1. Install all of the above, then restart Firefox.
2. On the toolbar, right click then click 'Customize...'
3. Tick 'Use Small Icons', and drag back/forward, address and search bars (and anything else) to the 'menus' toolbar
4. On the toolbar (again!!), right click and untick 'Navigation Toolbar'
5. Play around with stuff, get it looking right!
6. Load this script into Stylish (By clicking that button just below here!!)


Known problems: 
- Tabs don't play as nicely as they do when they are in their normal spot..
- 'List all tabs' floats and appears to be cut off


Have fun!!
