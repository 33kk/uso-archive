### Description
A simple theme for Feedly for widescreen. <b>Sidebar included (unlike other wide themes here)!</b>

Based on 
http://userstyles.org/styles/84468/feedly-wide-and-clean-like-google-reader 
with elements from 
http://userstyles.org/styles/84445/clean-feedly-for-wide-screen

Differences: sidebar is enabled, Lucida font used for article view, some little visual tweaks

<b>Tested od 1680x1050, Chrome 28, Win 8; can be used with any color theme.</b> Not to be used with other userstyles for Feedly.


<i>It has some bugs which you are free to correct. I merely put the theme to fit my needs.</i>
