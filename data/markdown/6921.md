*Update*
I uploaded the embedded version of the Crystal Firefox background into userstyles.org. So, no need to download the image every time. And now it is compatible with screen resolution of up to 1680px (width)!!! Have fun guys...

For those who prefer to use the file from the web, copy and paste this css code into stylish:
