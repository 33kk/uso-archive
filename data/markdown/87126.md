### Description
This user style hides the annoying, intrusive overlay rubbish that Upworthy insists on throwing at you. In addition, it provides an easier-on-the-eyes light-on-dark theme (not white-on-black!) with most distractions removed. This style is updated on a regular basis as Upworthy web developers do their best to make the site less and less usable by people with any visibility constraints. Which is a little ironic, considering the site.
