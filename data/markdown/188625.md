### Description
A customisable style to select what to show and what to leave out in the new Facebook menu.

### Update notes
Only keep what you need in Facebook’s left menu! Select “Customize Settings” and choose what you want to display or to hide :)

The style currently works as a white list, so if Facebook add new items, they will be hidden.

To do:
* Black list rather than white list
* Hide elements from the top navigation (customisable as well)
