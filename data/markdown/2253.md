### Description
Cleans:
 - AccuWeather promotions
 - The left and right sidebars
 - Unnecessary "Related Sites" boxes
 - And More...

Updates:
 - 1.01: If possible, make the content lay itself out in two columns, instead up taking up only half the screen.
 - 1.02: Fixed a bug where radar maps would disappear, and one where random boxes would appear behind                   two-column content
 - 1.03: Got rid of some random red bar on the quick-look page, removed the promotion for Accuweather ads, updated the screenshots.

Feel free to edit and submit it when new promotions etc come around. I'll try to keep it up to date too. Also, if anyone has any suggestions, let me know.
