### Description
Introducing a complete redesign of Userstyles.org.
I do not like at all the normal design of this website, it's ugly. Also, there were no TRUE redesigned of userstyles.org.
So with this in mind, I created a complete re-design of this userstyles.org.

New background, new menu's, new headers, made site centered and fixed width, improved the overall general look of the site.

I hope all you sylish people enjoy this code!

Please report any pages that do no display right, or pages that aren't themed.

UPDATE v1.1
