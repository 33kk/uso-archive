### Description
This style barely even qualifies as a style lol. It is made simply to help users (particularly staff members) deal with PM's, as it enlarges their width, while shortening their height.
This style works exceedingly well with other styles, as it doesn't affect much, and can be switched on and off with stylish when toggling between PM's and the want to battle.

Also, don't be misguided by the screenshot, the PM box should fit perfectly, no matter the computer screen size, unless your screen resolution is set to a width of 1024px or lower.
