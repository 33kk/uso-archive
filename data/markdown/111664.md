### Description
An <b>eelektross</b> based CSS made for Pokemon Showdown servers.
If you see any error or something that looks weird, please PM me in a server such as <a href="http://origin.psim.us">Origin</a>, I'm usually under the name Master Float.
This CSS is by far the biggest and the most time consuming CSS I've done so far.
This CSS is dedicated to @Nick.
