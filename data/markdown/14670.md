### Description
IPTorrents is great, but the logo on each page is too big for a smaller laptop screen. I wrote this style to remove the logo and give the user more real estate. Big thanks to melcron for helping keep this going, as I haven't updated for over a year. 

IPTorrents hardly uses a static name for logo image (currently it is I-P-T.jpg), so this style will break ever so often. If it is not working, please send me a PM on IPTorrents and I will get it updated.

If you like this sytle and want to show thanks, please donate to IPTorrents to help keep it running.

[09/14/2009] Updated to hide the following images: iptbanner.jpg, iptbanner1.jpg, iptbanner2.jpg, iptbanner3.jpg for good measure.
[12/08/2009] Updated to include iptbanner.jpeg
[03/14/2012] I'm back. Used melcron updated file and added I-P-T.jpg to the removed images.
[02/06/2013] Added NewYear.jpg
