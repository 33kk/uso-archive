### Update notes
<ul><b><u>CHANGE LOG</u></b></ul>
<dd><i><sup><mark>04.29.2016</mark> ~ Minor improvements and tweaks.</sup></i></dd>
<br>Inspired by user 297063's style 123512
I mostly did this to test out the style settings!!<br>
<ul><b><u>DISCLAIMER</u></b></ul>
<sup><ul><i>For fair warning, this style was created in google chrome, as it's my browser of choice. As for this styles compatibility with other browsers, that's not something I really have a way of testing. Also, my overall knowledge of coding is limited -- this is a hobby I've only just recently picked up -- so most of my styles are created by trial and error. So, I hope you can all be patient with me, I assure you, I am doing my best! Thank you for your time. = )
