### Description
I made this script so I can surf the web without showing any images or aberrant formatting, preventing my wikipedian escapades from being detected at work.
Once actived, all text becomes a dull, uninspiring (and most important, discreet) plain black text. The links are almost undiscerrnible, but you can add a underline effect or something similar (edit the style and modify the line a{text-decoration:none !important;color:#003366 !important;} with underline or similar).
The images are (barely) visible once you hover the mouse, and can be viewed in full if you click on them (for images with hiperlink act as to drag them)

Flash ads and stuff may be on the way, you can set them to transparent editing the line rememberand is always possible to turn the whole thing off.
In the preview bellow, you can see in the "after" picture how a particular image will look with the mouse over it:
