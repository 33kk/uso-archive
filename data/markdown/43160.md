### Description
Initial release: 01/24/2011

This is based on an old theme originally created by ModStar and later continued by VincentD. I had to recreate the three icons and rewrite some code, but now everything looks fine. If you are fed up by all these fancy themes with multicolored backgrounds and are looking out for a clear simple theme based on the original facebook design then this is what you're looking for!

I also added code to make the top bar stay in position while scrolling down and some other tweaks. Very handy, special thanks to Code.Red! http://userstyles.org/styles/25094

By the way, credits for this release also go the Wills Bithrey, I borrowed some of his (very well-written) code from his absolutely fantastic Theme called "Subtle texture and shading": http://userstyles.org/styles/41499
