### Description
Developers are mostly habituated with a Dark UI in IDEs. and as a developer myself I find it really comforting to work in a Dark and Flat UI. There's not much styles available for Godaddy CPanel. SO I made a custom one for myself, and sharing with everyone.
I'll keep updating the code in my Free time.
Theme Features:
1. Custom Login Screen (Option for custom logo coming soon)
2. Dark Flat UI throughout the CPanel including all tables, modal and text editor (Some glitches will be fixed in next update)
3. Circular Images (Flat Transparent icons coming soon)
