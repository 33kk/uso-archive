### Description
Hides border and background of tabs, giving them a "flat" look.

*** UPDATE - 21/01/2009 ***
Now flattens "All tabs" and "Scroll tabs" buttons, too. "All tabs" button moves down of a couple of px when hovering. However, I like this.
(Good idea user 14809, thanks!)

*** UPDATE - 25/01/2009 ***
Fixed affected elements height to 21px to prevent it to increase of 1px when hovering on "All tabs" button.

Designed by rise of my style 12915. Of course it works stand-alone, too.
