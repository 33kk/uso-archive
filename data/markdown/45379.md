### Description
EDIT: NEW FIX, WORKS.

This is a simple style which changes the layout of the page when you click the "expand" button on Youtube videos. This makes the player fit much better with the style of the page and makes the video even bigger. Looks much better for HD videos.

* Increases size of Wide (expanded) player.
* Removes annoying grey background.

Hope you like it.
