### Description
A Mastodon theme I made for my Mastodon instance, inspired by Fallout: New Vegas. Except it doesn't have any actual New Vegas specific theming, so really it's just a nice, dark, transparent Mastodon theme. The transparency means that you can have a background, which by default is non-scrolling scanlines. Another nice feature in this theme: posts now look like rectangular speech bubbles. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/excitedneon/mastodon">the GitHub project</a> this style is taken from.

Mastodon version compatibility: 1.3.1 (probably at least any 1.3 should work)
