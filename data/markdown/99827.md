### Description
Facebook is changing its theme and some of users are not comfortable with the new style. Persian people are one of those groups; because, the only stylish Persian font among web-defined fonts is tahoma and the font of facebook statuses is something else.So that I created this one that everyone can enjoy it. So, enjoy it... :)
