### Description
I don't think this is a bug in FF3 interface, but as a keyboard fanatic, I don't really like to click-select-drag to copy-paste the user-agent.
This small and simple style fixes this, allowing fast checking the version of your lovely, fiery browser.
And most of all, the buttons container have the same height if contributors are shown or not.

(18/5)
Sorry huge bug in the first release, I've just fixed it.

Only for Firefox 3.x .
