### Description
This basically just removes a few extraneous items from the full-screen clock that TimeAndDate.com offers -- the logo, the upper righthand controls, and the "Local time..." header.  Just the date and time.  You'll need to change the "?n=64" at the end if you don't live near where I do. :)
