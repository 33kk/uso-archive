### Description
[v0.3] This is a theme for Omegle. I created it to match similar messaging apps, blue on the left, light gray on the right. I simplified everything too, I removed the clutter on the top. In later versions I plan to clean up the css, and possibly add message transitions, flying in from the bottom/left, similar to apple's iMessage. This was mostly a proof of concept I worked on in one night, but I'd like to improve it. I'll eventually match all the colors, add hover and pressed styles for the buttons, etc
