### Description
Affects the German and the English Warhammer 40k Lexicanum wiki.

Changed the colours of the text paragraphs and links. It's much more readable for me now. Visited links are a bit darker so they don't stand out as much. Hope you like it.

Nota bene: the styles are for articles mostly, portal pages' colours are not separately adapted (I don't use them much), so might be less optimal, especially visited links. Feel free to update and let me know.
