### Description
Super minimalist Gmail.

This will probably break horribly when they roll out the new Gmail look soon, but what the hey.

Removes most distractions. I use Quick Links so I left those in but streamlined them. 

I realize some functionality will be missing, but it's easy enough to toggle it off in Stylish when you want to go edit some filters or settings. My theory is that if I'm not going to use it every day, I don't want to look at it every day.

In the screenshot I pinked out my labels and quicklinks, so that's what those squares mean.

I used some of the work of other Minimalist Gmail userstylers, so check those out too.
