### Description
This style will change your Workflowy page as follows:

* Notes will now show full notes, not just the first line of a note
* Share buttons are hidden
* Font sizes are reduced
* Indentation lines are removed
* Notes are indented with a left border showing the note area
* #tags and @tags will now look more like tags by using a background color, rounded edges (in modern browsers), etc.

### Update notes
<b>Updates:</b>
5/21: Updated the code to allow for custom colors and border styles


<b>Notes to other Workflowy Stylish authors</b>: I've seen a couple others using my code - please do! :) I'm pretty sure I borrowed a great deal of the original code as well!  Hah!
