A brand new notification button is on its way to make things look a bit more modern. I'm just not decided with the style of the button yet. Also I worked on a snow machine! I believe I already added it before to the Steam Holiday Profile 2015. But now it's gonna be an option to turn on and off.</blockquote>

I re-created this profile for people who could not get their hands on this Holiday profile or simply because they did not want to waste their precious money on it since this add-on will disappear forever on January 2015. Please note that the small animated characters hiding in the snow of the featured showcase header may or may not be implemented in the stylish code due to the CSS limitation. However, with CSS3, it is possible to animate them using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp">@keyframes</a> but it is a lot of work to animate them.
