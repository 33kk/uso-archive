### Description
This style is a GUI modification for Firefox 4.0 under Windows XP/Vista/7. Its features are:
-A new Firefox Menu Button, that displays an icon instead of text.
-The glow of the Firefox Menu Button will fade in and out.
(Optional:)
-Placement of the tabbar into the titlebar to save space.
Most of this changes only apply, if the "tabs on top" option has been set by the user.

Note: The screen shots aren't up to date, but still similar enough.

There is a newer version of this style.

### Update notes
ver.0.4.4

Based on:
-"Firefox 4 Tabs in Titlebar/App Button as Tab-WinXP" by rob64rock. http://userstyles.org/styles/39893
-"Firefox 4 - Move Tabs into Title Bar (Win XP)" by lOtR. http://userstyles.org/styles/36044
-"Maximized Appmenu Button As Tab" by foxxyn8. http://userstyles.org/styles/39724
-"Firefox 4 menu button in Vista/7 style ANIMATED!" by wojtekmaj. http://userstyles.org/styles/35240

WindowsXP or Windows7 recommended.
I have tested it myself on XP with different skins (Luna,Classic,a Vista-like skin) and a buddy of mine says it looks alright on 7. Ergo, Vista should be alright, too. I haven't tested it under any other OS, but I would apreciate it, if some of you would do and give me your opinions.

This style has been tested on Firefox 4.0b9 and 4.0b10pre.

issues:
-The tabbars padding has been set for the use in XP. If you use Vista or 7, you might want to set another value. Edit the line "-moz-padding-end: 7.5em !important;" and "margin-right: 9.5em !important;". Value of 10em or 12em for the first and 12em or 14em for the second one should be fine, but I'm just guessing.
-Dragging of the window: There is space between the Menu Button and the tabbar and on the right side of the tabbar left, while not maximized, to drag the window around.
In the code below, there is a line "height: 36px !important;" in comment tags. If you uncomment it, the titlebar gains a few pixel height, you may use for dragging, but it might also create ugly looking graphic errors.

Changes in 0.4.4:
-Mozilla suddenly putting the tabbar into the titlebar themselves in the beta9 release took me by surprise. I fixed the glitches, my style created beginning with beta9. If you're still using beta 8, there is a bit compatibility code in comment marks down below. Just uncomment it.

Changes in 0.4.3:
-Fixed issue with FFButtom in newest nightly build (FF4.0b8pre).
-Refixed on 16.12.2010

Changes in 0.4.2:
-Fixed disappearing tabbar, when menubar activated.
-Added free space between the Menu Button and the tabbar and the tabbar and window-buttons on the right side, while not maximized. This area is there to drag the window.

Changes in 0.4.1:
-Ajusted the Firefox button's colors and glow effects, according to the values I found in the omni.jar.

Changes in 0.4:
-Now all new: Firefox Button ANIMATED!

Changes in 0.3:
-Icon in Firefox Menu Button has been replaced.
-Removed "Personas applies to titlebar for Firefox 4" by Style Thing. http://userstyles.org/styles/37940
I gave it another thought... If you want it, wouldn't it be better to install it directly from the source? Yah, it would.

Changes in 0.2:
-minor graphical fixes in glow effect of the Firefox Menu Button
-changed #appmenu-button-container position from fixed to relative. This comes at cost of less
control about the FFButton position, but also places it at the right positions at the edge of
the window. May lead to FFButton overlaping with a AppTab.
