### Description
Makes it easier to read changesets in Mozilla's "mozilla-central" Mercurial repo.  Visually highlights the transition between code in one file and code in another so you can tell where one file ends and another starts.  To see it in action, try looking at https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f341fc58f595 .  Updated 2012-10-28 to include mozilla-aurora and mozilla-beta.  Updated 2013-03-09 to include mozilla-release, mozilla-integration and fx-team.  Updated 2015/12/22 for new internal page representation.
