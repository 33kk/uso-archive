### Description
On my computer, GitHub's default font-family specification (which almost always has Monaco,'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono','Courier New' at the start) results in Courier New being the default font used for every monospaced element. This style just switches every declaration of font-family that I could find to use the 'monospace' system default instead. This would be the one you can set in the Firefox preferences or your system fonts settings.
