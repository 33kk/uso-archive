### Description
Kotaku violates what I consider one of the cardinal rules of web advertising - don't cover content. This script removes the marquee that slides across  the featured articles at the top of the page.

This script is very specific, and does not block other ads, as those seem to be properly handled by ABP.

Update 20090723: Add io9, gizmodo and lifehacker
