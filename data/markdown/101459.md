### Description
DISCONTINUED. Facebook updates too often. I can't fix all the elements regularly because it gets boring eventually. I'll work on a new facebook theme to just override the chat and news feed size, since they're the primarily the reason why I still use this theme. After that this theme won't be continued any longer, so byebye updates. :D

Features:
◈ a dark and clean interface for Facebook
◈ replaces the pale blue Facebook color with a vivid shade of blue
◈ bigger chatbox for easier chatting
◈ complete with custom edited icons, logos, and animations
◈ full support of the Facebook Help Center and Facebook Like/Share widgets on external websites

Add-ons:
◈ auto-hiding sidebar: style 101531
◈ rounded corners: style 101594

Note: Install the font "Open Sans" for best viewing experience.
