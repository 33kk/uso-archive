### Description
NeuDark is an eye-saver modification of the Stylish and Stylus Admin interface for Chrome. The interface is completely redesigned for a dark experience, incorporating Font Awesome icons and a semi-material theme. NeuDark currently supports all of the dark syntax themes shipped with both platforms and will support light-to-dark theme conversions in the future.
