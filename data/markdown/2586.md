### Description
This style replaces the icon for attachments in Gmail.  Like others before this style, it changes the standard paperclip icon to an icon that reflects the filetype of that attachment.  However, unlike previous versions, this version sets the icon to whatever your particular system's default association for that filetype is (with 2 expections).

For other peoples' previous versions, please see:  style 226, style 304, style 464, style 465, and style 1807.  Collectively, they are the inspiration for this style.

If you have any comments or wish to see a particular filetype included, PLEASE leave a comment - I'd be happy to hear from you.  Thank you!

Also, now please see style 3678 if you would prefer the icons to be slightly larger (32px).
