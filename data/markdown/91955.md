### Description
A dark image background. I liked the dark image background on Firefox when viewing images like jpg, gif, & png directly, so I created a style for it to use in Chrome and other browsers. Anytime you view images directly in the web browser, where you see it ending in the image extension like http://i.imgur.com/6sJvBjx.jpg , a file from your computer, or whatever, you'll have a dark background instead of a blinding white one.
