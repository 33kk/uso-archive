### Description
Does a lot of tidying of the rivals network (as it likes to call itself).  Many British football fanzines and unofficial sites use rivals.net (for example, the Ipswich Town twtd.co.uk), which is unfortunate, as they're plastered with ads, horrible fonts, cramped text, useless images etc.  Not any more, though!

20070213 - updated to get rid of new Rivals links that recently appeared at the bottom of every page
