### Description
This script is based on the http://userstyles.org/styles/50115/google-return-the-black-header-back-to-white
Since i am not gd in scripting i changed a the values from this wonderful script to my liking and thought should share these with others.
However the full credit goes to the original author LOOGi3.

Yes this is STILL the dark bar but put in better contrast for LCD screens and will be pleasing to the eyes!

this script also includes the Google+
updated: now includes picasa too as it has come to my notice.
