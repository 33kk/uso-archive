### Description
Updated: November 19,2007
====================
- Fixed new table background on forums

This makes world of warcraft forums safe for work browsing.

Removes the following:

- User Info
- Backgrounds
- Login
- Search
- Reply/Post New Topic

If you want these features at work.... you should be fired :P

This should only be used as a quick browse in the general/pvp forums.
