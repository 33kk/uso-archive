The following userstyle for tumblr was (MOSTLY?) made by Sasucaek, better known as Strawbellies. SasuSaku in a starry background for your Tumblr Dash.
---
I had limited screenshots to use, but there's plenty of options from icons and logos and such.
MOST? Of the coding was done by me ok. MOST. Sob. MOST MOST MOST.
---
There are a few known glitches and things, such as the hover permalink that I am aware of.
The logo changes back to the normal tumblr logo on a few pages due to incompatibility (Doesn't look nice bro) like the settings page or help page.
--
If the coding doesn't spread to one page of tumblr or something incredibly noticeable glitches, <b>please send me an ask.</b>

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year SasuSaku Tag! -2012.
