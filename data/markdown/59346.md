### Description
SAVE SPACE for your location bar according to the SIZE of your window. I've just adapted my previous style for the Search Bar ONLY (http://userstyles.org/styles/55732/auto-show-hovering-search-bar-icon-bookmarks). 

Displays the "Search bar" ONLY, just under the awesome bar just by hovering on the location bar when you are in NORMAL WINDOW MODE.
And in MAXIMIZED WINDOW MODE, the Search Bar is INSIDE the Navbar.

Process :
- Step 1 : Slip the "Search bar" into the Bookmarks Toolbar (and only, teh Bookmarks have to be located in another ToolBar).
- Step 2 : Allow the display of the Bookmarks Toolbar
- Step 3 : Install the present style
- Step 4 : Adjust as you want the Search bar position in the TWO modes. You can also adjust the length of the Search Contener.
