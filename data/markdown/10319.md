### Description
Animates the Statusbar when you disable the AutoPager extension.

Works only for Firefox 3

Features:
+ Animated background of the Status Bar when the Auto Pager Extension's status is Disabled
+ The animation will cycle through Red, then Yellow, then Orange.  This is done in a slow manner, not to be too distracting to the user.
+ More flashy to the eyes, notifying you that you probably accidentally disabled the extension (happens to me lots)
+ Animation and background color may be customized

Reason Behind This Style:
+ There is a setting in Auto-pager to disable the extension if you hold Control and Double-click.  Now this can be changed, but not many people know how, so you end up accidentally disabling the addon.  This style helps that fact.

Applies to:
+ Autopager Add-on Status Bar Icon (animate APNG)

Integrates with Styles:
+ Style 9895
+ Style 8816
+ Style 8770

Works on:
- Firefox3 Only.

Changelog:
- Initial Release
