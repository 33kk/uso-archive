### Description
UPDATE:
SEPT. 5 2010 - This is still in beta and some aspects of Gmail might not be completely styled yet.

Please send any bugs or missing styled parts to jdorenbush@gmail.com and I'll try and update soon.

The style was inspired by a custom Google page: go.infinise.com

FEATURES:
- Completely changes color scheme 
- Removes Chat and Invites
- Removes right hand links column in Reply window
- Adjust sizing and spacing of some elements

COMING SOON
- Add style changes across all Gmail pages (e.g. Settings pages)
