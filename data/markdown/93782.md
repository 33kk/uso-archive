### Description
Fixes the position of the top part when doing a Google search, so you don't have to scroll up again to change the search query. Known bug: when apps button/account button clicked, the different types of results option (beneath search bar) overlays the popup. Anyone who can fix? Tell me via dA! <a href="http://devilishdb.deviantart.com">devilishdb.deviantart.com</a>
