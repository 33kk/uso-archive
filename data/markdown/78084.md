### Description
This mod modifies the soundcloud comment box to be click-through-able on the bottom part where the waveform is visible. 
this allows for scrubbing through tracks without having to disable the comments.
in the screenshots the arrow is the mouse pointer, before = no scrub-bar, after = scrub-bar.
