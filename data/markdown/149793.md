### Description
If you prefer not to always have Whatsapp notifications enabled, but would like to be able to easily turn them on when you choose, this minimizes the annoying giant blue banner, displaying the full banner only on hover.

You can ignore it until you want to turn on desktop notifications, then enable it. Disable notifications easily through the browser address bar.
