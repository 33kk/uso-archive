### Description
Takes the two Gawker sites and makes them Fullscreen & Restructures them. The following changed:
A) The width of the Main Articles - takes up 80% of your actual width now.
B) Sidebar/Navbar/Gawker favorite bar is moved to the right side of the screen. Since it's not a navbar, that's where it should be.
