### Description
Constricts Wikipedia to 55ems (or whatever you change it to). Great for keeping line lengths within reason on widescreen monitors.

Unfortunately, because of some weirdness with the <body> element on the site I wasn't able to retain the background image. Anyone who can work around the issue will win my eternal gratitude.
