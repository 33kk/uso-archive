### Description
Highlights active tab with color (easy to change), changes color of spacer beneath tabs. Makes inactive tabs hardly visible.  Highlights inactive/active tabs with mouse over.

Code documented well.  Based off of "Colorize Firefox 2.0 Active Tab", added a couple of features and documentation.

Do not use with "Hardly visible tabs", won't override dimming of inactive tabs.
