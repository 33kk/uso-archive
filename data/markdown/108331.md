A Five Nights at Freddy's theme! Install and enjoy.
Q: Where is Bonnie?
A: Look in the top left corner.

Q: Uhh, I don't see chat and battle pics.
A: I could not upload them. Sorry! Find them here: http://imgur.com/zCzMich,kBxoax2

Q: Can you do FNAF 2?
A: Um, not really, WAY too many animatronics and I can edit oh so many parts. Sorry.. I want it too.

Q: I wanna make my own theme...
A: Use any of mine! Based off of the Dark Tornadus T Fully Commented theme, I can make this theme possible. Soon as I figure out how to change the theme into more depth, I will make it creepier! >:D
EDIT: OH MY GOD. Almost to 100 installs?! I cannot believe it! :o THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH :D This theme is now the top of the line of any theme marked under "Five Nights At Freddys"! I am so speechless.
