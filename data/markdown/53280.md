### Description
The idea behind this was to create a userstyle for Firefox that leaves menus alone and features a better color scheme.

At its heart its based on style 44217, some URL bar theming from style 47810, and the color scheme of my own userstyle style 46990.

Currently this is for Windows Vista/7 only, but as I do use Linux everyday you can expect a Linux version soon.
