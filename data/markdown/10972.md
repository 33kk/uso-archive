### Description
This is a relatively simple design to style google's image search.

This does NOT style the web search or anywhere else, simply all pages relating to image search, as such the code uses URL prefix to apply the style to all google image searches, ie. .co.uk, .com, .de ..... and so on....

Few un-needed bits and pieces hidden and font will need to be set by the user.

See the first 2 lines with the stars for setting font size and style. Arial is set as default, you can switch this for any Font your PC has installed. Size is down to personal preference so again just set this to as you choose.

Only 2 images used in this style, both are converted to base64. Other images have been hidden where needed. I did have the google image working for nav and logo but they served no purpose so ended up removed, shortnening the code some what to...

NOTE: If you use google images in a small window the design will sometimes render images outside of the containing elements. This happens on the regular google site with no styles. However i have added in an extra line for when this happens, the container will produce scrollbars when needed. 

Enjoy!
