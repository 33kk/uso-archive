### Description
Converts any Drone web UI into a dark theme with blue/orange primary colors, should be colorblind compatible. Does NOT work with the official Drone website.

Note: You must change the domain to match your local Drone instance(s). Currently it's set to drone.io which isn't actually what this CSS style is for.
