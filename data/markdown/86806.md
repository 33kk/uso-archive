### Description
I saw people was kind of bothered by the dark style of the forum, I am one of those too, my eyes kind of die of white text on a black background, but I hadn't taken the time to actually do a CSS hack to fix it. Now I've doodled with regex to remove background images, made a PHP snippet that inverts all hex colors and removed everything that does not control colors. In the future I will probably tweak stuff as this was just a very quick inversion, not the best look. Whenever I feel like it :P
