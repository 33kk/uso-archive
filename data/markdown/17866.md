### Description
This style makes Stylish 1.0+ look like Stylish 0.5.9, along with other modifications that make this style great for fans of the old Stylish window. Thanks to user 1 for the base of this style, I couldn't have made it work without him. Also, I used the bubbles from style 245 by Matt Nordhoff.

Note: To get the standalone Stylish window as shown in the screenshots, go to about:config and change the value of extensions.stylish.manageView to 1 instead of 0
