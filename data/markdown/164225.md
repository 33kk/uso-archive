### Description
This is almost a fork of https://userstyles.org/styles/138257/the-pirate-bay-material-design-update-v0-4
Although i fixed a few bugs, since it does not look like the creator isn't updating it anymore...

i didn't have time to not allow this as a global style, you may experience problems on like 1% of websites on the www.
