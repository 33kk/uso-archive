### Description
The June 2011 redesign made the search box + button acceptably contrasted (back to pre May 2010 again, thanks!) but this time around they put RED WARNING COLOR on the wrong places and added a "Bing-blue" color that made the never-clicked search button very disturbing. So this userstyle once again became necessary to keep sane.

Fixes (updated):
* search button + text input box:
    both get a single border with contrasted borders
* search results count:
    restores readability of the search result counter so can use Google for spelling and phrase usage checking
* left-side navigation area
    fade out disturbing colour and icons

This style activates on www.google.*
