### Description
[For Firefox] No more those ugly bast***s that ruin your life with the black on black thing using dark GTK theme. From what i learned, this happens when the site you're visiting, have no CSS for the input colors, so it uses by default black text... and by your default the themed black box. That's coz input boxes and such are themed by GTK, which FF uses, but the texts are usually themed by the site's CSS.

To workaround this you need a global theme and change the box and text color by writing this: textarea, input, select { color: #222; background-color: #fff }

Of course you can change the colors and invert black and white but i would not reccomend coz usually the site that are affected by this use light themes, so black boxes are usually ugly for them.

Ah, i set this theme to affect only websites, not local sites, of course you can change this easly.

You can use ecosia.org (as June 2018) as an example to see if it works.
