### Description
I Was just looking for twitterfox @ my Firefox Chrome folder and found 2 files : "black.xul" & "black.css". 

I tought: "Maybe this black interface will be avaliable soon."

Them i just copied the contents of this "black.css" file and added the "!important;"'s.

So, this is not my code. It's 100% from the twitterfox creators. So i dont think that anyone get any type of bug.

Enjoy! :)

@krisu: Yeah! The part that like most are the black popups. Kinda mac-ish. :)
