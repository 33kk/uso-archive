### Description
fixes and improvements for MI-R3G router Padavan firmware
* fixed a dark theme that, to put it mildly, was not always dark. In addition, the Dark Reader browser extension is supported
* the color of the icons is correctly inverted, several types of inversion are added, so that you can choose the one suitable for all occasions
* added the ability to change the height of the frame in which the list of network clients is displayed (can be configured for any screen, but basically it is for the screen> 768 pixels in height)
* pop-up informational message no longer creeps out of the client list frame, which caused the scrollbar to appear earlier
* buttons and other interactive elements are highlighted when you hover, and the backlight has two types - normal and warning (you can choose colors or turn off)
* now only the part of the interface that contains a large amount of data is scrolled - the menu, top panel and tabs remain in place

### Update notes
0.1.1:
- fixed loading modal position
0.1.0:
