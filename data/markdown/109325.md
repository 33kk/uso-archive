### Description
The main target here are the idiot 200 px high signatures that forum dwellers seem to love so much.
    
Signatures limited to 1 line, with fade effect to show that something is hidden - click to see full signature. Using click rather than hover so the page does not reflow while scrolling down.
    
Trimmed another ~100 px/message by cutting down avatars and hiding steam user info until asked for by hovering over it.
    
Any items clicked or hovered stay open. Better that than closing and re-flowing the page.
