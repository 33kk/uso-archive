### Description
One more for the list... kinda whitespacey - clutter fighter - googly - thingy.
- <b>Style Update 3-26-12</b> - Browser scroll bars fine-tuning.
Goals were: 
- Optimizing horizontal space
- Clarity improvement (padding, visual grouping, removing unnecessary noise...)
- A quieter color scheme 
- Improving the logo.

(March 13 edit) - Thanks to <a href="http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/30297/x"target="_blank">feedback from Ostern</a>,  who liked the style, and verified stability on Chrome (which I planned for but couldn't test on my older mac).

### Update notes
<b>Style Update 3-29-12</b>
Improved toolbar's scaling ability (for browser text zoom capability)

<b>Style Update 3-26-12</b>
Seems the scroll bars bug people. Fair enough.

Horizontal scroll bar is now working properly - <i>normally</i> absent, present if needed.

Vertical scroll bar is now removed by <i>default</i>, with <i>option</i> to turn it on (see options section).

Why would you want it on? If you do <i>not</i> have a scroll wheel or track pad and dislike
 using the page down key to access the bottom of long pages (Help, Forums, long folder list on Tasks page).

If so, you can choose to have the scroll bar set to auto (read <i>on</i> at Toodledo - at least for me, style or no style) 
by choosing so up above prior to installation..

If you already have this style, This website - Userstyles.org, may see that and
 <i>not</i> provide an install button (even if you deleted it - for me anyway). 

If so, set the option as you like it up above, then click 'show code' button down below.
Copy and paste that code over the old style in the Add-ons Manager screen of Stylish.

Updated screenshots to include more dividers in task list, and a screenshot
 of my left side and popup calendars.

<b>Notes (not style) edited on 3-13-12.</b>

If anyone is wondering why I didn’t reduce the height of the whole top row, there <i>is</i> a reason:

<b />I tried every way possible, and after running the site with different preference settings, it would inevitably break.

It may just be my setup (although that <i>seems</i> unlikely), but every other style I installed that decreased the height
of  the top row, did indeed break. 

I came to believe it isn’t possible due to the auto-hide option for the left-side column.

Anyway, could be wrong, but have moved on to other projects at this point.

<s>I didn’t get around to posting a screenshot of my left side and popup calendars</s>, 
but I think they’re pretty decent.  Far easier on the eyes than the originals. 

I changed the font site-wide to Verdana, one of the easiest-to-read screen fonts around.

The notes area is set to a default width, based on text-on-screen readability guidelines.

And so on. It's free - hope you like it - go get things done.

I've used it for four months now - still stable on:
Mac 0s 10.4 Firefox 
(Actually TenFourFox - Firefox optimized for PowerPC's running Tiger)
