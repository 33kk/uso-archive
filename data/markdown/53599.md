### Description
The text editor Parchment used by Animevice currently allows users to switch between version 1 and version 2, this is useful if you do not like version 2 or your browser doesn't work with version 2 but if you like version 2 it is just an annoying little message taking up space. Enter Parchment v2 Switch Message Hider, it does just what it sounds like it hides the message so you don't see it, need to see it again just turn the script off.
