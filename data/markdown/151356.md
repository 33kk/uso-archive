### Description
Planning Center Online is a suite of applications for church administrators to manage all the aspects of the church. Services is one of those applications that deals with flow-of-service and volunteers. This style aims to bring this application into the future. Some of Services' app sibling have a more updated look (Services is WAY out of date in style), and this style tries to follow in line with them, as well as add some useful tweaks.
