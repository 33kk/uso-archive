### Description
This style lets you change the color of hashtags on Twitter pages. You can stick with the default color provided, or change it to one of your choosing. Enjoy!

### Update notes
A quick update to kokx's style, but this one actually works with Twitter (at-least on most pages) in its current state, and allows you to change the color through userstyles.org.
