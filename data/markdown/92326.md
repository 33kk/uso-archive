### Description
Replace RalpherZ, DogFace, and Keepo with beautifully drawn counterparts. (You can also get them seperately: http://userstyles.org/styles/92373/ http://userstyles.org/styles/92417/ and http://userstyles.org/styles/92418/)

NOTE: Every once and a while when twitch updates with new emotes some emote IDs change, and since this script is based on the emote IDs, I need to update the script every time this happens, so if it stops working, either update this script or wait for me to fix it and then update it.
