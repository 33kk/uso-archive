### Description
I wrote this so that when I am shopping I can immediately "distinguish"...
 - The Description Sub-Heading 
 - The Item Number
 - The Seller
 - The Seller's Feedback Rating

I also have edited other font displays somewhat. Please forgive the absence of a proper credit... some of the other font display part of it was originally started from someone else's code, but its been so long that I cannot remember who to give that credit to.  Anyway, I have re-customized it so much myself... 

I hope others may find this useful.  
**I might also recommend GreaseMonkey... For myself, I use some "featured items" list controls, and an "including postage" control that are invaluable, however, there are many many helpful ebay scripts there.  Well worth checking out.

Cheers, HTH
