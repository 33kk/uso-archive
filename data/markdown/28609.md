### Description
A different take on dribbble.com - focussing on the designs being showcased rather than the user who created them or the fans that viewed, liked or commented on them. The mark up behind dribbble is pretty lean (props to Dan and his team), so I couldn't consistently hide everything I wanted to like the popular tab.
