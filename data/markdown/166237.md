### Description
Unnecessary elements removal, button rounded radius reduction, add home page random background image, navigation & "make default" frame auto hide.

Compatible with all 5 existing official themes.

Just saw so many previous Startpage.com stylish files are outdated so I made this for myself.

Known issue: Due to Content Security Policy enabled by Startpage itself, random background image is not working for now.
