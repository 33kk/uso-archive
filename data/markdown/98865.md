### Description
I love John Gruber. I have a lot of respect of John Gruber. John Gruber is, however, a prolific procrastinator and despite saying for years that he probably should update DF's CSS to be more modern, he continues to fail in doing so. This is my own opinionated take on how I prefer to read his site.
