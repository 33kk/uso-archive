### Description
Warning!  I know nothing. It work 4 me. Maybe you like, maybe it break everything!

All credit to user 7730 and user 12 . Don't know if I did it right. Just guessed. I copy bit of superb style 7519 into fantastico style 518. Take me 30 seconds. I never try before.

It's a Firefox 3 'stop button and style 7519' ... she moves! Recommend style 2125 also (but see b0at's review).

I see NASA Night Launcher Theme and Firefox 3. Not idea about other (deluded) people. :smile:

I say stand up next USA pres and vice pres: mcdavis941 [ http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=547498 ] and user 7730 .
