### Description
Removes the shadow gradient behind the YouTube video player bar and gradient above. Helps a little bit with reading and seeing stuff normally hidden by this bar. :P I miss the old player that didn't cover videos :'/
I've made the option to set the opacity between 0% and 100% to vary how visible the gradients are. hope you enjoy~ ^_^
I'll try find out if I can give the option to color them, I'm still learning. let me know in the comments if you want this feature, cheers. :D

-If you want the Player bar to be moved below the video, try my other style for it: style 137651
