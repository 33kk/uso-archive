### Description
Optimized for widescreen monitors (1920x1080) and google chrome, this dashboard layout features a transparent lavender body and a solid darker lavender color for notifications as seen in the screenshot.
My monitor is pretty bright, so your results may vary. 

***Note: This can be used on firefox/waterfox, however, some of the styles may not show (i.e - pointer arrows, some border lines, small things like that.)
