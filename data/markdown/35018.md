### Description
(This style has been updated for the latest version of Firefox. It's available here: style 59377)

Drawing from several of the scripts available on this site, I created this style to strip down Firefox's UI to the bare minimum.

This style is meant for people who rely mainly on keyboard shortcuts and/or users of the FireGestures extension, who have no use for distracting buttons on the navigation, tab and scroll bars.

I recommend installing the foxiFrame basic extension along with this style, to eliminate the title / caption bar and cut down on Firefox's UI still further. This style incorporates the codes for hiding the fullscreen, minimize, maximize and close buttons suggested in the foxiFrame options dialog.
