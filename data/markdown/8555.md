### Description
Gives you Rounded Edges on all tooltips.

* Thanks to user 5424 for introducing me into the "Wellrounded" types of styling with style 8366

This makes your tooltips look really cool, and utilizes some of Firefox 3's latest features.
This style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.

Tooltips are the small informational popups that appear when you hover over certain buttons, links, and areas of web pages and the Firefox UI.

Applies to:
+ Navigation Toolbar (Hover over button)
+ Hovering on a tab (tooltip will have radius)
+ Also Applies to EVERY single item on any web page (Hover over a link)



Additional Information:
+ Uses new CSS3 Circular Radius Supercode!
+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.
* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.

Browser Versions:
+ Works only on Firefox3

Integrates with the following Styles:
+ Style 8558
