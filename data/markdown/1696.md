### Description
This very simple style will set the max height of all comments and posts to 150px. Anything taller gets auto scrolled vertically, and anything wider than the natural page width gets scrolled horizontally.

So when people are spamming desu and anguished jew, it doesn't take up 50% of your /b/.

If 150px is too short for you, just edit the max-height until you are happy.
