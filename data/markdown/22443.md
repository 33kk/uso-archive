### Description
Shows position-numbers in Google.at resultpages (SERPs) with awareness of local results and news in front of the actual results. As of CustomizeGoogle's current non-development status, another solution had to be found.
Known "issues":
When clicking on page 2 and so on, it won't add the last 10 results to the positions, so it will be number 1 again.
If anyone has a working solution, please contact me!
