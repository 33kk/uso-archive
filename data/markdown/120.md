### Description
Now supporting 12 forums! Please feel free to suggest other forums for inclusion. (Peng: I took out the old adblock plus forum and added the new one, since the old one hasn't seen a post since june or july. Thanks for the suggestions).

Most importantly, it keeps long links and screenshots from overflowing the page width. Secondly it restricts the maximum vertical height of the post itself, as well as it's contained quote, code and signatures.

Based  on Matt Nordhoff (aka Peng)'s "style 42",  this fork aims to support a wider variety of forums.
