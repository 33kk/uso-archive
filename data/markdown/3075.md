### Description
I was really annoyed with the 'Spoilers!' label that is obscuring some of the entries in FAQ subsection of the movie page (it might appear in other places too, I don't know) - you have to hover the mouse over the entry to make it visible. I removed the label and instead coloured the 'spoiler' entries red, so it's still easy to distinguish spoilers from non spoilers.
