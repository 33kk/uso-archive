### Description
Plain white and grey AO3 skin + dark color schemes. Link colour and fonts may be customized.

May also be installed using AO3's site skin feature: adjust the additional settings to your liking and install it in Stylish first. Then copy and paste the CSS from Stylish when you make a new skin in AO3. Remember to disable the skin in Stylish when you're done.
