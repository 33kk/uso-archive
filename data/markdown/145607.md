### Description
Chat Box (and other scrolling things) for Dueling Nexus by Skeletonxf and Yubelious!

The current chat space takes up a whopping 30% of the entire screen! It is a commonly known bug that, immediately after rps and before the duel starts, if that 30% of the screen is filled entirely by a block of text, the duel will resize and in many cases become unplayable. By containing this chat inside a box, we are able to avert this issue.

In all honesty, any old box will do. But I decided to work on a version that feels a little more... Stylish!
