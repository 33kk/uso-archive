### Description
This increases the size of the buttons that let you page through the usershop, safety box, gallery, item archive and appearance doll archive. It also adds a border and some padding to give them a wider breadth and make them easier to click on.
I can't do anything about the 'current page' number being much smaller than the other numbers, sorry.

March 3, 2017 update: Added buttons to archive pages.
March 8, 2017 update: Added buttons to the forums.
