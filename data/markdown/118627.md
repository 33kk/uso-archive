### Description
Old Firefox complete themes are not compatible with windows 10 updates - this style unblocks the controls 

Change width to correspond to your display resolution

Change of color on buttons' hover is not enabled by default due to possible incompatibility with different display resolutions/button widths

### Update notes
Tip: to pick a perfect button width take a screenshot of an active button in any other app (like explorer) and use Paint to measure the width in pixels. Just trying out different widths effect on Firefox is a faster way though

Known issue: GlassMyFox addon disables this style
