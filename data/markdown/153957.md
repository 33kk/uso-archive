### Description
Have you ever wanted to change the sites theme from that boring grasslands? Well now you can! This code will change the default theme on the entire website to the desired one of your choice. 
<p>Click on Customize Settings to choose a theme.
<p>**Edit: I noticed there was a bit of an issue with backgrounds not filling the entire screen (probably only seen on high resolution monitors), so I fixed that.

### Update notes
This code will effect the entire website and change the background theme for every page.
