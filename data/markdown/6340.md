### Description
A mixture of my own plus other styles put together to make a very clean, simple & pleasing to use gmail interface. As I have compiled this over time with numerous edits I have lost track of who's styles I have included...so if a bit is yours...please mention & I will include credits.

Just to mention a couple of things...

- hidden app bar (top left)...will appear on mouseover
- hidden unessary links in the top right
- non beta gmail logo
- only search email box present
- neat mail bar
- new email icon
- proper attachment icons
- etc, etc
