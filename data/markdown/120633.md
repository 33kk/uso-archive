### Description
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE, ACTUALLY READ THIS: 
It should be mentioned that this style is not fully complete.  It's functional, and with general browsing the missing stuff won't really be noticeable, but there are things(Player profiles come to mind) that have some missing elements.
I haven't had the chance to test this across multiple browsers and computers, so there may be some issues.    
If there's a bug, report it by sending me a message here: https://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/user/51351-daftkitteh/

This also may or may not work on chrome.  If it doesn't, I'll work on making it work on chrome.
