### Description
I found the new forums ( as of 2011 - 2 - 10 ) to be to bright to my liking and disliked its fixed with elements as well. This style attempts to fix it up a little.

- Forums use full browser width, this may not looks as nice on every resolution, sorry.
- No more hot-pink highlighting, now its just boring blue
- Colours set to a white/blue on black, colour scheme was adopted from GryMor's post here: http://forums.white-wolf.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=929580#post929580

Known Issues
- Stretched header and footer misalign and look ugly
- Images for quote, thank, etc do not look very nice in this style

I'm not a designer I just adopted GryMor's work and added some additional changes, if you dislike it its probably because I suck at this.
