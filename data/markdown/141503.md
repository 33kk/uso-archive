### Description
Spotify Web Player (SWP) got a new update, and their domain moved to open.spotify.com.

Thus, I have taken my old Galactic Style and converted it into the new player! Enjoy!

This style does the following:
-Shrinks the annoying HUGE album covers
-Changes background to dark galaxy
-Changes certain colors to a pink/blue combo
-Volume and controls are pink colored
-My own original galaxy logo in replace of the boring Spotify white logo
