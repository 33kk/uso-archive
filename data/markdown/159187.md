### Description
Night/Dark/Black theme for TerraMaster TNAS online. Makes the folders, top bar, and most navigation items appear in a dark mode. I created this since the default themes were all bright colored.

Designed for Firefox, but can be imported to Chrome to work with that browser - just copy the CSS and "import" to Chrome in the style settings of that browser.

NOTE - this has not been tested with new versions of Stylish. Only confirmed to be working with Stylish versions that were published prior to February 2018.
