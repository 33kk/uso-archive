### Description
Choose your favorite background and find your torrents on floating flakes of glass - go ahead, sail away!

A bunch of high quality wallpapers are offered as seen below (*)
Very easy to pick an another if you prefer, just browse your own collection on the harddrive, paste a web address, or follow the instructions below.
You can also change the text colors.

### Update notes
Update Oct 21, 2017: 
(*) At the moment, I can't load TPB with wallpapers from this style anymore. I have no clue why because none of my other styles encounter this problem. As a result, you will get a blank (white) background and that looks awful to me. 
So I give you an option to pick your own background color (I have set it to black as default), in case those  wallpaper don't work for you too.

<b>How to replace the images (edit in the code) - this is not necessary, but it makes the page load much faster:</b>

If you find an image you would like to use, then download and save it to your HDD/SSD because the page will be loaded <b>MUCH FASTER</b> with an image from a disc than from a busy web address!! Especially on larger images.
1. So, find a nice wallpaper and download it to your computer. 
Let's assume in this example that you want to download the wallpaper called "Space Sunset" ( http://i.imgur.com/yndRntW.jpg ) and save it on the pathway d:\
2. See line 10 in the code:  
--wallpaper: url("http://i.imgur.com/yndRntW.jpg")
In this example you should change the pathway   
http ://i.imgur.com/   
to     
<b>file://d:/</b>     
where the d: (or c:, or e:, etc) is the letter of your disc/partition the image is stored on (remember to include the full eventual path way to your image).
You should also write (or copy/paste) the title of your image (in the example the title is yndRntW.jpg )
Following this example, it can look like this:     
<b>--wallpaper: url("file://d:/yndRntW.jpg")</b>
3. Hit the "Preview" button to see how it looks. If you like it, then hit "Save" and you are done :)

-------------------------------

Regarding adds, banners, popup's and other sh*t on TPB; I haven't found any script who's working - they are all useless because TPB probably use "Geotargeting" (meaning I can block all where I live, but you live somewhere else....).
So, I haven't spent time on it because I know I also should fail...
Best solution is to use the add-on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/sv-se/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/">AdBlock Plus</a> and (important) use this subscription: <a href="https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/filters.html">Fanboy Ultimate Adblock list</a> (it's a merge of the popular Fanboy and Easylist).  With this subscription installed I have reached a 100% successful ad/popup-extinction, highly recommended!
