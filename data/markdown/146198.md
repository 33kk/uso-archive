### Description
Black like my other theme but this is for the new compact theme that comes with Firefox. So before you install this, go to about:addons (preferences/options) --> appearance --> compact dark. If you're on Nightly 57, you can also use my userChrome.css, while not like this, still a black and minimal theme: https://pastebin.com/AUSzqWXB

### Update notes
Tested w/ Firefox 54 on Linux Mint 17 and Windows 7.

To hide the titlebar on Linux, you can also install Hide Caption Titlebar Plus https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-caption-titlebar-plus-sma/
