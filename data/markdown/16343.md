### Description
This will remove the text in the filter list links, leaving only the icon (hovering over an item still shows the name of it, so it's easy  to know which is which when the icons are similar).
This leaves room for a bigger stream, making it at a width of 620px instead of 544px. Can be combined with my other Facebook filter list mods. Enjoy!

Change Log:
March 26, 2009: Modified to include resizing of the new "Create a List" filter
