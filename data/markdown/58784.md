### Description
OUTDATED: USE THIS SCRIPT INSTEAD
http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/122314

This script allows you to see the emotes from:
/r/mylittlepony
/r/mylittledaww
/r/mylittleonions
/r/iltbat
/r/mylittlefortress
/r/vinylscratch
and 
/r/mlplounge

on all of reddit. 

Moderators: Do you want one of your subs on the list? PM Twilight_Sprinkle on reddit with the sub you want added.

Note: MLAS1 and MLWTF are excluded from this because of the *huge* number of emotes they have. If you want their emotes, use their userscript. It would just make a mess if I tried to copy them.

Thanks to:
RogueDarkJedi for being awesome and convincing me to use userstyles.org.
The mods of /r/mylittlepony for starting and maintaining this awesome community and for the original emotes.
The mods of all the supported subs for providing the awesome emotes.
