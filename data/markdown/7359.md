### Description
For this to work you'll need to have Firefox 3 and the Glasser extension installed. The Glasser Extension adds the Vista Glass effect to Firefox. You can find that extension here:

This style further integrates the design of FF into the Vista OS. It changes:

- back & forward buttons and their dropmarker
- the urlbar dropmarker
- the reload button
- the stop button
- all throbbers (nav-bar, addon-sidebar etc.)

On the screenshot the reload button is shown in :hover status, just to display it.

this was only tested on the default theme so if the margins of buttons or sth. was changed you might have to change some of the margins to make everything lign up properly.

Also, urlbar, reload button and stop button have to be aligned in this order or it obviously won't work.
