### Description
Reddit's user interface has almost always been the same since it's dawn. The UI is, often times, inconvenient to use, rendering it unfriendly for navigating across the website. Some people wanted a better looking, easier to navigate, and a cozy facelift and hence <b>Reddit MinimL</b> came into existence. It provides an elemental crispy and a minimal look to the website iced with a completely redefined user experience.
