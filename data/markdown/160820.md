### Description
I've been busy on SmartMusic recently.. so here comes a dark mode for it!

It's kind of confusing to find this website for the first few times you visit this website, so here's the link: admin.smartmusic.com

Q: Why no old SmartMusic?
A: It's not on a website (unless I'm wrong, then whoops message me the link)
