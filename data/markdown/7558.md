### Description
Hyperlink Hover Styling for ALL WebPages.  This style improves page navigation and element focus, for pages without their own form of mouse-hovering.


Features:
- Orange href hover highlight text (customizable)
- Will only show up on pages that don't already have a hover color.  In the case of an orange background, or custom sites.   If you want this style to show up no matter what, add !important between the last 0 and the : in the code.

Integrates with Style 8772

Changelog:
- Initial Release
