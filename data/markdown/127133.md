### Description
This style hides a bunch of blocks on the Steam store pages of the games.
Why? Sometimes abundance of meta information about the game can prevent fun discoveries. 
Disregard the hype and user reviews. You've got screenshots and description that developers provided.
Also good for minimalism lovers.
