### Description
Feedly crops images in both Magazine and Cards View, which is nonpractical when you're using it to follow a lot of photography blogs. This custom style changes Cards and Magazine view to display a 250px or 333px square area, where pictures are centered, uncropped and their proportions are retained.

Feedback is welcomed. Thanks.
