### Description
This is a theme made for GitHub. It is made darker, since i personally don't like the white pages from GitHub. They burn my eyes! Tried to keep as close as the official design from GitHub as possible, while making most darker / "blueish". The more blueish side instead of full dark, is because i personally like a full Deep dark theme, because for some reason it is missing something in my opion.
