### Description
This style sheet makes visible some useful hidden links at the top of the page - "skip past navigation", a link to Twitter's mobile site and so on. These links become visible on keyboard focus - use the TAB key.

The style sheet also gives the whole page a black/dark grey background, with status text appearing in pale yellow, status links in pale blue and other text in white. There are still a few small things to fix, but I wanted to get it up here for feedback.

Please give feedback here and on my blog,

Enjoy!
