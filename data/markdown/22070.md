### Description
Simple style replacing the default Strata40's buttons with others without the text. All I did was a little cutting+pasting, so all credits go to the original authors.

Buttons keep their original height (now 40x26 instead of ~100x26).

Obs: the CSS contains embedded images, so it may look larger than expected. Don't mind it :D
