### Description
CLARK Gives YouTube a darker look for a better viewing experience and makes it easier to focus on the video you're watching.
It removes some unnecessary lines, backgrounds and effects to give it a cleaner and flatter look.

• This style won't be getting updates for a while now since youtube brought out their own clean updated and dark theme. You can enable it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">youtube.com/new</a>. When they roll out this feature to everybody by default I might update this style for the new look.
