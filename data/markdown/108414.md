### Description
You know, you hover over the avatar, or the blog name, and an advertisement for the blog pops up whether you want it or not. Usually I don't want it, and this style can prevent it from popping up.

### Update notes
You can either suppress the popup completely, or reduce the size of the "hot spot" that triggers the popup. For the post's avatar and Tumblelog name that's a 12px square in the upper-left corner (the green squares in the screenshot); for the "Recommended Blogs", "Radar", and "Following" that's the avatar image. 

You can also completely remove "Recommended Blogs", "Radar", or the post avatars if you like.
