### Description
Are you a php developer? Are you tired of the way the php.net documentation looks? Here you go. This is actually fairly close to how the design used to look, before the most recent incarnation, wherein the php.net designer(s) apparently thought it would look great if every single element on the page had a border around it.

And this doesn't fix odd markup decisions, such as using blockquotes for "notes" instead of a div.note or div.information (or at least a blockquote.note).

I'll be happy to maintain this in case there are any issues/bugs/requests.
