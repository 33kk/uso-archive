### Description
Replaces the blue accents with your MacOS or Windows 10* accent color. Optionally you can choose your own color. Note this is made for the Developer themes for now. I'll update soon. 


* It actually uses the Windows highlight color, so if you haven't changed that to match your accent color it's still going to be blue. I recommend using Accent Color Synchronizer to set your system highlight color to your accent color.
