### Description
This is basically style 18702 by user 10596, but with the search header enabled on the main page.  Darkens/blackens up the site a bit: makes it easier on the eyes.  Also removes ads and social media junk.

I have since started to use the Greasemonkey script Webcomic Reader.  Has numerous features and tweakable settings for a large amount of sites (including MangaFox and other manga sites).  Highly recommended.  I will still continue to update this userstyle though.
