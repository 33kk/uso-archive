### Description
Has your account been targeted for the new facebook skin?
Do you wish to revert back but Mark spits on your face?
Wait no more 'cause the old facebook hybrid is here.
Since version 2.1 I used some lines from style 46326 and style 81901

P.S. You need a monitor WIDTH of at least 1120 in order for the skin to work properly.
So tabs and stone-aged Pc's might have to turn away :(

P.S.S If you want just a color, no photo as background just insert some random letters in the "Provide your own" box and select the color you want.
