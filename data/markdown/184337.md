### Description
A heavily modified version of the "Global Dark" theme.
I loved it as it was but it felt very barebones to a degree.
I went through the code over the course of a year every time I noticed something that was off.
My solution to every "off" element was to make it transparent in contrasting degrees.

Example: A foreground 25% transparency against a 75% bg transparency created depth.

The only issue that arose after making practically everything transparent was finding a background that wouldn't make text unreadable on certain websites.

After using stock images to make several backgrounds that worked well I finally found a format/formula for taking any image and using it as a proper background for the theme.

If you use/like/enjoy this style but discover an issue where an element is improperly displayed or to request a background that works with the theme from your source image please feel free to contact me at: flapthejax@gmail.com 

Enjoy.
