### Description
Liqube Night style

A nice balance of dark backgrounds and medium bright text for late-night surfing. Usually pretty easy on the eyes, especially when you've been in a darkened room for a while. Effectively prevents sudden white flashes ;) Images are slightly dimmed as well.

Let me know if like this or if you find it useful :) Thanks

Recent updates:
- incorporated input fix posted at the Javanese blog - Thanks!
- handling background color for about:blank and fixed Google text input field
- images slightly less opaque which is easier on the eyes.
- color updates, fixed bright borders

I recommend using this style in combination with a Firefox theme called "NASA Night Launch".
You might also want to check out my other styles:

Liqube Day - takes some strain off the eyes during day-time
Liqube Printable - great for printing in black and white

Enjoy!
