This style shrinks the height of the toolbars to gain more place for the real content. It also adjusts search boxes, and includes code for different other extensions:

 * General toolbar

 * Google Toolbar and GoogleBar Lite
 * Youplayer
 * All-in-One Sidebar (AiOS) General design
 * AddOns in the Sidebar (with AiOS)

 * Chronic in AiOS
 * Console² in AiOS
 * Stylish and Stylish in AiOS
 * URLParams in AiOS
 * ScrapBook
 * Firefox Companion for eBay
 * Organize Search Engines
For some pieces I borrowed code from styles of user 7858 -- namely from style 7956 and style 8027 -- and adjusted it to fit in the whole work.

Results have been tested with Firefox 3 on Linux under KDE3 (KUbuntu Hardy) using the default (Classic) theme and Firefox 3.5 on Windows XP (also default theme).
