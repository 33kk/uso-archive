### Description
Version 0.1

A style sheet for Delphi Forums which gives all forum pages on Delphi a common look. Comments in the source code allow you to set your own color preferences. Inline ads are blocked and a couple of other elements are removed, too. This style sheet is mainly geared towards basic (non-paying) members like myself.

Version 0.1.1

Added feature: there's a new block for setting a forced text color, here white; used if the default background is black or dark. This block is commented out, however, so if you want that you'll have to remove the comment markers around it.
