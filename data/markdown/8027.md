### Description
Compresses Firefox 3's Awesome Bar (Locationbar).  
Gives you more room to type in that long URL, or to search using the Awesomebar.  This style compresses the buttons on the new AwesomeBar, Removes Padding from the Buttons, and Shortens the Address Bar completely.

Features:
+ Decreases Height of Awesome Bar
+ Removes Padding from Live Bookmarks button, Bookmarks Button, and Site Identity Button
+ Greatly Reduces Vertical Padding from Site Identity Button


Integrates with the following Styles:
+ Style 8026
+ Style 8023

Additional Information:
This style works only on the new Firefox 3 browser.
Gives you more space in the Firefox 3 Awesome Bar (found on the Navigation Toolbar)

Theme Support:
- A small bug causes odd appearances with the theme Aero Silver Fox Basic, currently this style is incompattable and should be disabled.  I have begun fixing the bug, but this theme is really different and may take a while until it is fixed.
+ Should work on all other themes (let me know!)


Changelog:
1.0.0.3:
+ Widened the urlbar just a tiny bit.  Now _ underscores and . dots appear correctly

1.0.0.2:
+ Fixed critical bug that prevented the Right-Click menu, and Live Feed menus from appearing correctly
+ Old code has been retained, but commented-out

1.0.0.1:
+ Added Support for FullScreen Images.
