### Description
Brings the tumblr sidebar to the left + makes it stuck to the side while scrolling, moved content to the right, and some nice polish to the background! 

There is a separate version with the avatars located on the left side, instead of the right! You can find that <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/101923/">here!</a>
