### Description
Removes the cow logo, moves the search box over to the left, and reduces the overall height by 35px â€” enough to show one more task on your screen! I could further reduce the height, but it ends up cutting into the status message region when it wraps to 2 lines.

I also locked the position of the right column. I find the animation to be distracting.
