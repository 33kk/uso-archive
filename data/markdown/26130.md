### Description
This is a partial work I did in order to make the RTM UI RTL compatible
Now there's no excuse and they can release the RTL Languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Persian etc.)

Enabling the non-supported languages is still a bit of pain in the butt so I guess we'll just have to wait, in the meanwhile you can join the translation team and request for a preview, this way you can unlock the full potential of the Styling using your own language

I would love to get some corrections from the users, also keep in mind that i'm no pro so there might be some problems

Kind regards,
Yaron Shahrabani
