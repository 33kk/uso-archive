### Description
I noticed Futurama wouldn't display in full screen when the window was taller than it was wide. It looks like the videos are being displayed in a 16:9 container even when they're 4:3, which means the contained video may be trapped in two sets of black bars, one for the video display and one for the rest of the screen.

This fixes these cases where 4:3 videos are trapped in two sets of bars, making them fit in the entire window.
