### Description
Just got an Android smartphone and XDA Forums seems to be the right place to get some good information.
Since I'm going to spend hours reading stuff, I might as well clean this mess up before. 
This Userstyle tries to remove anything that does not convey useful informations and soften the general appearance a bit.
