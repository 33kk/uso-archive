### Description
Okay, so, I lose access to this (my original) account, make a new one to post a new style, go to update it and find that now I can't access that account anymore (update: I managed to log into it again now and closed down the old version of this style), but now I can access this one again. Weird, but, well, at least I got my original account back? Anyway...
This just a darkening of Baka-Tsuki.org I made years ago so I wouldn't kill my eyes looking into the sun the whole time I was reading, which I never decided to throw up here until now, for whatever reason. I have gradually modified it over the years to keep up with updates to the site, so the resulting code is so Frankensteined together that I'm not even sure what a lot of it is supposed to do anymore, or even if parts of it are still necessary at all. Well, it works, and that's what really matters in the end, right?
