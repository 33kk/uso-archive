### Description
Fork of Dark Gray style by friday for those who prefer light colors.
Updated: fixes for forum tables and some parts of page with "invisible" text problem.
Updated: fixes for new logo markup.
Tip: if you switch between White(old) and Black(default) original styles, you can see there are some differences in link positions at the top. :)

For correct colors in LOR TreeView use mydoom~'s variant of this style.
