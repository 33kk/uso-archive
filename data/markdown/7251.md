### Description
A lot of work went into this - if you appreciate it, please support my work as you are able.

The people have spoken! I took out the search-go button because I don't ever use it myself, but its easy enough to add in, and I already had the graphic from a personal theme. added a

v1.1.3: urlbar tweaks, mostly; some page fixes; fixed findbar
v1.1.1: statusbar fix; added new go-button image
v1.1: lots of bugfixes; misc changes, added search-go button back in per request

Description: makes urlbar rounded and transparent; gives more vista-like titlebar menu effects; fixes some visual discrepancies in glasser; makes elements more transparent (back, forward etc). Makes page element input boxes rounded too (the text is a little cramped in full boxes, but this is to avoid resizing the boxes while also preventing flow changes in poorly coded pages).

Show rounded text fields, menulists and more in Firefox 3
Includes webpage fields and multiline fields
shows blue hover and focus for all fields (vista-themed colors)

I've integrated parts my vista statusbar and findbar theming upon (many) requests;
also shows solo images (if you click "view image") centered, shows wider google results (full-width) - all easy to comment out if you don't like them.

Only tested on Windows. Please post screenshots and post in forums for bugs.
====>IMPORTANT: Unfortunately, it is impossible to code a CSS theme that works right on both windows and linux. So, this is a WINDOWS theme. For a linux theme, please see vbielawski's style 6463.

History:
v1.0a3: First major version
