### Description
Just noticed, Fastmail now provides their own dark theme. So may want to look into that. Will leave this here for posterity.

White screens hurt my eyes, so since I stare at mail often, I needed it dark. I had to keep the white background for writing and displaying emails, but many screens are now dark. Sort of looks like an IDE dark theme.
