### Description
This theme is for those who need a calmer and less bright Ravelry to navigate it. 
I have tried to remove as many moving or jarring images where possible. I also hope this enables people to use the website without headaches, migraines or seizures. 
By no means am I an expert in this, I am just a junior software engineer with no real experience in front end or UX design.

<strong>NOTE: I was unable to change the loading screen when you log in. It will still have a moving flag while loading.</strong> 

If you find a spot I have missed, please let me know by giving me a link to the exact page and a description of the problem. 
I will try to fix it as soon as I am able
