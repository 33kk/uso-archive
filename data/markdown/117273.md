### Update notes
Dev Userscript Version now available for testing here(Not Stable bugs may appear any bug should be reported to the Github Repository/along with any fixes should you have one any help is good help)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snintendog/Youtube-Player-Editing-2015/master/Dev/YPARWL.user.js

0.000005 Removed the Endscreen Animations and changed the flashing pause/play icon to a more square shape. Reverted the Progress Bar to be smaller and centered to fix a bug and fixed the subtitles button underline while in full screen.

0.000004 Fixed HD button while in fullscreen, the i card button, the bottom gradient is now not displaying, Cleaned up and organized the Css, and adding a new drop down for those that Use Youtube Center and its fixes(only needed for auto hide versions. 
The Default for the style will be the "Auto hide off [New method]No I don't use Youtube Center" now.


0.000003a was informed that playlists were off in theater mode pushing fix can confirm firefox 39 monitor 1366x768 fix works. For those wondering about the progress bar not updating while not being hovered over Css is limited and can't fix this alone but some userscripts have a fix for this.

0.000003 Added the fix for bouncing subtitles and a cleanup style for a watch later button restored to the controls(Will require a userscript using GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey MechaLynx has made it and is good by itself or alongside this style. Not finalized) Added a new method for scaling videos to browser+monitor resolution may be buggy and not all things are 100% yet It is in the drop down for [New method]. Edit: Forgot to add auto hide to [New method] oops

0.000002a fixed an annotation glitch found when using the 1366x768 auto hide off version. Noted that Chrome auto scales the width and height unlike in firefox and sets this style off and obscures/adds too much empty space in the video player.

0.000002 added the auto hide place holder for the userstyle site have found the auto hide fix and the correct player height for monitors with 1366x768 resolutions Drop downs are giving me some trouble

0.000001 Created August 3rd its okay i guess the buttons and the player controls and Progress bar merged and shrunk removed gradient background box(just hidden still is there in theory)color is still default red/gray for progress bar
