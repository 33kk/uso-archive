### Description
ETA December 20, 2008: I've completely revamped this script to work with the latest changes to the profile page.

What this script does:
- changes the font family to Verdana on the whole page
- removes the blue bars completely
- changes the font colour of the section headers to match the blue of Horizon/Vertigo
- adds left- and righthand margins both to the whole page and to each section
- changes the colour of visited links to provide a bit more contrast with unvisited ones
- reinstates underlining for the links in the Interest, Friends, Communities, and Feeds sections
- removes the unnecessary text from the tool/action bar
- moves the default usericon to the right side of the text
- makes the font size of the title and subtitle a bit larger
- mades the font size of the stats a little bit larger and changes the font colour to black
- makes the font size of the tags, memories etc stats a bit smaller
- adds some padding in this whole section to make it look less cramped

Enjoy!
