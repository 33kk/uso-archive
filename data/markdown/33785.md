### Description
Heavily modified and repaired version of Wikipedia Clean/Minimal. (I am not the original author of this script, although I did spend countless hours modifying it.)

Changes Wikipedia to a BLACK themed research style. 

ALso fixed many of the issues that were causing it to be unusable with the newest updates to wikipedia and fixed the Main Page.

LANGUAGES PORTAL DOES NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY (still usable just looks like shit). 

Note: Few issues with colors on certain tables, very infrequent though, still working on it.
