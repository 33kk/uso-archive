### Description
YouTube with Blue-Gray Background for the Classic layout only. In 2017 Youtube introduced a new layout. This style works only on the pre-2017 layout (the Classic layout).
In order to switch back to the Classic layout you need to click your channel icon in the top right to pop-up a menu, then click "Restore classic YouTube" at the bottom of its list.

Links to visited videos on the related videos sidebar have different color.

If you install this style and also install a greasemonkey userscript named "youtube-right-side-description" -  https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/976-youtube-right-side-description - then the likes/dislikes bar will be almost covered by the like/dislike buttons.
So in that case (and ONLY in that case) install my style 112269 and the issue will be fixed.
