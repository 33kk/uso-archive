### Description
Global dark theme. Makes everything black and dark.

It "flips" the colors, so sites already in dark mode will become white. Add the to the exclusion list (see below).

Most media (images and videos) *should* be unaffected. However images that are embedded in the background CSS may be color-flipped too (as far as I know, I can't exclude those. Sorry)

### Update notes
== Making Site Exceptions ==

This is a global style, meaning it will reverse the colors on EVERY site. If there are some sites you don't want this style to apply to (for example, sites that are already black), then you need to list those sites in the "Customize Style" button right next to "Install"

== Notes ==

2020-07-13 Fixed issue where subdomains were not excluded correctly. Should now be able to add either example.com or subdomain.example.com to exclusion list and will work fine.
