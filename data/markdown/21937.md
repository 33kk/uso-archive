### Description
Started out as an expirement with CSS3... thought I'd share it with the world (well, the sub set that visit deviantART.com :)) 

When you hover a thumb it'll rotate slightly and 'pop' out a little. Odd thumbs rotate one way, even thumbs the other.

Remove the comments (they look like: /* ... */) and the thumbs will be rotated always, and pop out when you hover them.
