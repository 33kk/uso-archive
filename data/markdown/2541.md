### Description
This style makes the cursor change to the respective site's favorite icon (favicon) when the cursor is hovered over the additional links added by the CustomizeGoogle Firefox extension.  This is similar to many other cursor hover ("link warning") userstyles, such as my take on that theme - style 2538.

This style applies to Google web search results.  I might also suggest you try try my userstyles that acomplish this for the other supported sites:

style 2539,
style 2540,
style 2542.


Enjoy!  Please feel free to leave comments.  Thanks!
