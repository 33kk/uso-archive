### Description
Sage's appearance in general has been irking me for quite a while, especially since migrating to OSX. Here is a neat little style to fix some of the problems I had with it.

P.S. The "twisty" (arrow thing) is hidden under the folder icon and still operates normally.

P.P.S. I was going to do something with the resize gripper between the two lists, but I decided I liked it better blank.
