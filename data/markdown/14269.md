### Description
Adds changes to profile pages (including gallery/favourites pages):

- Blue links rather than grey
- Green polls instead of orange

-----------------------------

If you just want the poll and pageview stats styling, remove everything under the line /* Links Restyling */ (except the very, very last }) and then Save.

This removes all of the blue links, leaving them their original colour.
