### Description
May 2, 09 - This style currently does not work quite right with some of the subreddits - ie: the ones that use non-default styles of their own (WTF, for example). This won't be updated for at least a month or two, as this will take a significant rewrite of the CSS, and I don't have time right now - sorry.

Dec 9, 08 - I finally finished making this style, after losing interest for several months.

It is a dark theme for Reddit, with some blue in it as well. 

By default, image previews on the homepage are turned off (I find them annoying; also, less of a chance of NSFW pictures showing up). This can be changed by removing the indicated code at the bottom of the style.
