### Description
Based of the Gmail Dark, Blue, Transparent theme.  I removed all the "shiny" effects and went with a more flat, but pleasing dark grey look.  I also fixed a number of issues with the drop down menus and the conversation div's.

This was done in about 15min of work, so it's possible that I've missed a few things.  Feel free to email me for fixes.
