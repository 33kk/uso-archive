### Description
Simple FB Userstyle that formats it for printing. Just open the page you want to print, turn on the userstyle, and print / save as pdf / whatever.

I got tired of not having a means of saving Facebook threads so I can send them to people or save them for later, when something worth saving comes up.

Now it'll be easy.

No promises to update, but it works great right now. Feel free to take it and do what you want with it.
