### Description
-This Style makes a colored player bar below the video instead of over it.
-What I actually did was make the video background lower than the video, and set a color. You might see the custom color on the sides of the video, so I made it a gradient, so most of it is black. (Ask if you want it to be turned into a rainbow of colors) :3

-Note: Unfortunately the video suggestions on the side are moved down with the player, I can fix this, but it wrecks Cinema mode. :/

-The Bar should work at almost any aspect ratio, (but my brother figured out how to break it) :P

-This bar is not visible during full-screen, sorry... I gotta research how to auto hide the bar if it is overlaid over the video for this.

-I set a default hidden Shadow Style, but you can customise the shadow gradient for the top and bottom with my other style: style 135027
