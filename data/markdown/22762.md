### Description
This is a mod/add-on for style 13255. To use it, you need the aforementioned style.

What this style does is improve on what I think Lady Grey II lacks most - styles for links and menu. Improvements include:

- Restores styles red links (non-existent pages)
- Rollover style for menu and links
- Triple column 'other languages' menu
- Rounded corners and shadow on menu
