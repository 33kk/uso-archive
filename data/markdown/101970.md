### Description
A solid attempt at making Gamepedia Wikis a much more clean, information driven experience. There's also an optional dark theme which only theme's the main content section of each wiki.

### Update notes
todo:
- Maybe look into adding an option to remove all wiki-specific theming at some point, as some wiki's that have bright UI's look quite odd with the content section so dark.

changelog:
-fix a bug introduced by site changes, add white drop shadow to images in the content to improve clarity of images that have dark edges.
-reworked entirely with a new name and more smooth compatibility.
-updated name and description
-fixed a couple bugs
-initial commit
