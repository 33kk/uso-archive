### Description
Inspired by Steam's pre-2014 look, this custom style repaints the majority of Steam pages to a dark grey theme.
<br>This is the Theme-only version that changes the color scheme but leaves the new features and layout in place. It applies to the front page, the game pages, the forums, the workshop, the community hubs and the achievement pages.
