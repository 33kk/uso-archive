### Description
Remember when photobucket first came around and it was very simple and clean and didn't try to kill your browser or scar your retinas? I miss those days.

This will strip pretty much everything from photobucket that's not login stuff, option links, or your gallery. Might be difficult to navigate. It will also turn photobucket dark. No clue what it will look like if you have a paid account.
