### Description
Changes the colors so that they look like the old tabular layout and removes padding and stuff so it looks like a tabular layout. Realigns user profile area like old times. Moves date posted to the left. Fluid width is perfect here (posts extend all the way to the right). Intended to be used with fluid width style, but it will work without it (with one minor bug)
