### Description
Rackspace webmail (apps.rackspace.com) has a fairly bulky interface that wastes far too much space to use comfortably on a 1024x768 (or smaller) screen.  This removes some of the bulk, giving much more room for folders and email contents.

This style requires reloading the page for it to be applied correctly.  Simply enabling it on an already open webmail page will mess up the dimensions.
