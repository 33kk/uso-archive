### Description
Reduces the wide-spreading gradient backing video controls overlaying a video down to 6ems from the bottom, enough to cover just the controls, and reduces the maximum strength at the terminator from 90% to 60%. Hides the central play/pause button when not hovering near, and reduces other control sizes by 1/3rd.
