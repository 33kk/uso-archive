### Description
This is a clean up style for a Persian web site. It does the followings:

- Removes the background
- Attempts to use Persian fonts if they are available on the user's machine
- Makes the font colour, size, and weight uniformed
- Corrects the look of the links
- Aligns the text to the right

This theme uses a font called IRLotus that you can get from here: http://www.ufont.ir/39-standard-persian-font/.
