### Description
A more work-place friendly style for World of Warcraft Realm Forums. Site name header is hidden, backgrounds are hidden, and colors more streamlined.

Some functional features are hidden. Blame this on Blizzard's dev team not properly coding their HTML! However, the forum is functional enough for basic browsing during your lunch break or whatever.

Enjoy!
