### Description
This style swaps out the default Facebook emoticons you see in messages and chat with deviantART emoticons. The emoticons are downloaded directly from deviantART servers, and the creator of each emoticon is credited within the code.

I tried my best to make sure I was replacing each emoticon with an equivalent emoticon from deviantART. Not all the emoticons are replaced yet, but I will add more. Also, emoticons are not replaced in some locations (like the emoticon menu in the chat box). This is just the base of it all. If you feel there is a better match for an emoticon that is replaced, or you notice that some of them are "broken", please start a discussion, and I will fix them as soon as possible.

More information about this style:
Any animated emoticons used will be animated when seen on Facebook.
Any emoticons with special sizes will display properly on Facebook.
