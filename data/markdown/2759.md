### Description
This style is based off of style 970 by user 774.

The aforementioned style changed the tab close button to a Mac-esque close button.  The problem I had with this was that I use a Mac OS X Panther Aqua style, and therefore, the red button didn't match my computer or Firefox theme.  This is the altered version.
