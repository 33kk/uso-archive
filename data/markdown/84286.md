### Description
In response to many user concerns about excess brightness and contrast in the new 2013 design I decided to do the obvious and simply create a userstyle to alleviate some of the main problems.

This design tones down the brightness by eliminating the white background, making the content area more consistent (no blacks, no whites, sidebar contents have same color schemes).

Removed huge facebook sidebar and sidebar-ad (other ads kept in place, you must decide for yourself whether and how to support AnandTech)
