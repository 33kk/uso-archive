### Description
Took style 44642 by ysbreker and fixed it for Chrome (webkit). I can't guarantee that it will look exactly as ysbreaker intended but it should make the style "work" at least. All credit goes to style 44642 by ysbreker because all I did was fix a few lines that didn't include webkit support. Hopefully this will help ysbreker support webkit in future versions of his style.
