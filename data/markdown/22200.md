### Description
Red and blue skin for Google. On the search results, the image has to repeat. Also, the "Gooooooogle" bar is black, but wtf, it's pretty sick for a first skin.

Got the original code from Valcar's Google Slate Blue theme, which you can find here: http://userstyles.org/styles/19745

Also, you can find the "After" screenshot by going to gyroxopex.deviantART.com, clicking "Browse Gallery", and searching for "Skins".

EDIT: For some reason, the area surrounding the Advanced Search, Language Options, Advertising Programs, Business Solutions, and About Google links isn't transparent. I'll update it as soon as I figure out why this is.

EDIT 2: It's actually something in Google's standard CSS. To compensate, you should get style 23582 by user 35475.
