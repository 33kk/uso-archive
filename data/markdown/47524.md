### Description
NOTICE: There is a known bug on selecting the addressbar via mouse/hover when using this userstyle; I am working on fixing it.  For now you can use keyboard shortcuts "ctrl + A" or "Shift + arrow keys" to select addressbar text.

This version places the stop/reload/go button on left side.  This section of the code was originally written by JC2k8, it's based on this script: http://userstyles.org/styles/47515/firefox-4-stop-go-reload-left-squared-win.  Both FF4 Squared for MX3 and this script would require modifications to work with each other, so I have decided to merge them into one script that readily does that.  This addon is not meant to replace his very nice script, use this only if you are also using the "MX3" theme for Firefox.

For the original version of this userstyle with stop/reload/button on normal right side, see link: http://userstyles.org/styles/46174/firefox-4-squared-for-mx3-theme
