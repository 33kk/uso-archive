### Description
Just a quick attempt at bing.Hasn't been tested extensivley yet,so let me know if anythings funny.Will update if i find anything,and put updated on title.Any tips appreciated as i rushed this one a bit(only know basics).Tried a two column layout,but couldn't get it quite right

Thanx all

Bing! Update - Can't use autopager with the search i'm afraid,is all mucked up.Sorry
Changed search design by request.Integrated bits of Bing: no ad + numbered results + better rendering by LeDiscret.
