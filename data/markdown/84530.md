### Description
This works for both the main page scrollbar and for scrollbars within the page. You may need to reload the page(s) after enabling or disabling. It is compatible with dark, light, and medium backgrounds.

For Firefox only - and may only work on Windows?

If anybody accomplishes the same effect in Chrome, I'd love to see it.

If you want to only use this on certain sites, that is easy - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/@document
If you want to only exclude certain sites, that is possible - http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/34446#Item_3 and if necessary ask for help in that forum.
