### Description
A darker Jupiter Ed for the student section of their website. Only one screenshot is provided out of concern for a possible privacy leak (not that it is needed, the theme is fairly consistent). Feel free to edit or suggest edits. I might plan on doing other color schemes in the future should it become demanded enough. Should you want a particular scheme, you can easily look at the theme in the Stylus/Stylish editor and change all reds to their desired counterparts.
