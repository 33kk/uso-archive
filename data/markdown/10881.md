### Description
This is basically the same as style 9349 (9349), except that the location bar text is larger (110%) than the original,  so can it be seen better during presentations.   While the font is even larger than normal there is still a huge removal of wasted space from the Navigation/Location Bar.   

The idea here is to use minimum real estate used for the Navigation Toolbar, and other toolbars, so that you have more screen space to use your browser for it's intended purpose of looking at web pages not space hogging graphics. This style uses roughly about 1/3 of the height of the original Navigation  Toolbar and is the part shown within the red borders.  The rest of the styling comes from my other styles.
