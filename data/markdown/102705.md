### Description
Simple code to make your dashboard wider. (and / but only the dashboard) Should work with other themes.

### Update notes
April 5 2015: Added a line of code to stop the recommended posts from expanding enormously.
      Also added code to stop certain images from expanding to the total width of the post.

Jan 23 2015: I changed the code for the right column. It should work better.

July 17 2014: Tumblr changed a little bit on the 17th July. It should be fixed now.

If your screen resolution is not listed then use an option that is smaller than your screen. Only the width matters.

I think it works best for people who follow text heavy posters. Images are basically unchanged. If it seems too wide then you can use a smaller resolution.
