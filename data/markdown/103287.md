### Description
A custom stylesheet for WikiFoundry wikis which updates styles to look more modern, better suit the WikiFoundry branding/colour scheme and remove traces of Wetpaint branding still present on the site.

This stylesheet affects all URLs ending with ".wikifoundry.com" - so if you're using a custom URL for your wiki, it will not work. Please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikifoundrycentral.com/account/Maxwilly">message Maxwilly on WikiFoundry Central</a> if you would like to have your custom URL added to the style.
