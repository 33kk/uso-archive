### Description
Prior context: http://icca14.sscnet.ucla.edu

Some aspects of the ICCA14 website may pose problems in reading or understanding. Instead of saying "huh?" I decided to use a repair initiator that displays a stronger grasp of the trouble source. These few lines of CSS help us get rid of rotated text and Comic Sans, unwrap the tabbed schedule for easier viewing and printing, and make the abstracts of individual talks slightly more readable. (The abstracts essentially have no structure so this is the best we can do.)

Feel free to reuse this code. And come to our panel on Sunday afternoon to hear more about other-initiated repair (Grand Horizon A on Sunday at 1:40 PM - 3:20 PM).
