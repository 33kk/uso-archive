### Description
I combined a lot of the code I found on here and then made my own tweaks.

1) moves "feeds" to the right
2) adds a scroll to "highlights" 
3) makes the menu/task bar transparent.

Simple.  Makes it look like a version of older facebook that has some new flair. I am not claiming any of this as my own, I just put it up here to save others some time.
