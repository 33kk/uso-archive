- An excellent GUI Improvement for anyone using low screen resolutions, or those who want more webpage content displayed.

Integrates with Styles:

About:Screenshot:
I am already using a compacted theme, so those using other themes (or the default theme) could most likely see a reduction of 10 pixels or more.  Though, a 3 pixel increase is still great!

Changelog:
- Initial Release
