### Description
<B>**IMPORTANT!!**</B> <I>This theme is deprecated! Please use A Dark Night instead. The only reason this theme remains up is due to the fact that the other theme is still in Beta testing. When A Dark Night comes out of Beta however, this theme will be <B>DELETED</B>. A Dark Night will, some day, allow users to pick the colors they want to use and the colors featured in this theme will become available there. Also, if you do decide to keep this theme for now and also use A Black Night <B>NEVER HAVE BOTH THEMES ENABLED AT THE SAME TIME!!</B> as this will cause a lot of graphical glitches.</I>

The A Blue Night user style sheet is my very first theme for a whole site that changes its appearance. [I had previously released a Simplified (No Ads) version of it, but that's not really changing much. :p]

This is a Beta release, which basically means that the sheet is not yet perfect. In fact, it is the farthest thing from. Why did I release it in this state? Because this is the only existing user style for this particular site and the sheet is in operational condition (meaning everything can be read, seen, and what not.) With time, I will improve the sheet up to a point that it will resemble perfection, but for now, bare with me if you all decide to use it. :p

I am going to focus on the Help section since its the part that needs most work. Hopefully, it will be fixed in the next couple of days.

Known Bugs
---------------
 - When typing a name (.e.g. Choosing a friend to send an IM to, choosing people to start a chat with,) a little box with a list of suggestions will pop-up. When trying to select a friend from the box using a keyboard's arrow keys, no highlight color is seen thus giving the illusion of nothing being selected.
