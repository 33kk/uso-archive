### Description
<pre>How to uninstall / turn off:
I really can't tell whether the revamped extension has a crap UI or the end user is at fault. It appears it's easier to leave a bad review than it is to uninstall it lol

Navigate to the ROBLOX website > Click the Stylish extension icon > Click "Installed" > Find ROBLOX 2011 Remastered > Click the bin to delete, or the switch to temporarily disable.
</pre>

<p>Alright lads - I've decided to redo this style from the ground up, and given my lazy efforts & the amount of bugs present in this version, we're back in alpha. I thought I'd release something <i>at least</i> usable while I'm in a state between actually doing it and giving up again.</p>

<p><b>Do not ask me to create more 'old-style' themes for ROBLOX, it's too much work.</b> - When ROBLOX update things on their side, I have to fix issues that may appear on each and every theme just to keep you guys happy. I simply do not have the time.</p>
