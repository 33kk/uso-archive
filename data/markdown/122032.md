### Description
Don't like these small videos on YouTube pages? Me too. So one day I decided to change that and created this userstyle.
<br><strong>This style expands video to fill all free space inside browser window. Like a fullscreen YouTube but not fullscreen. You'll like it!</strong>
<br>Scroll YouTube page down to see comments and other stuff.
Move cursor to top and the top bar with search will appear.

------<strong>Unfortunately, the userstyle doesn't work with YouTube Premium for now.</strong>------

------<strong>ATTENTION! Old YouTube design (pre-2017) is no longer supported. So turn on a modern design on YouTube if you want to continue to use the YTRCM.</strong>------
------<strong>Please try to uninstall and install the userstyle again if it don't work for you anymore even with modern design (which is unlikely).</strong>------

### Update notes
