### Description
Read: This is not an installable style. 

This is meant for Firefox Nightly 57 and if used for it, it'll only work as a userChrome.css file. The proper APIs to fully theme FF 57+ haven't been finalized so until then, this is what we have. I'm hosting here because I thought it still might be useful to someone. This hasn't been tested on any versions below 57 and likely won't work correctly for them either as they use a different layout. It's a very minimal and dark theme where the bookmark bar is autohidden. I can't take complete credit for this, parts of the code were gathered from bits and pieces of other people's userChrome.css files across the internet. View CSS code below for more detail to install and change.
