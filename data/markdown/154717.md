### Description
This is made to improve certain aspects of the school website. I have tried to make it more "modern" and changed colours for a better look. Also, removed some parts which were unnecessary and looked ugly.
You can choose from three different fonts with this style, but you are welcome to suggest any that you think look good and I will see if they are supported. If you have any suggestions on how to keep improving this, then also feel free to message me about it! :)
