### Description
Quick fix for <code>about:newtab</code> page on Firefox 33 and above for users who were using more rows and columns of tiles than Firefox currently allows.

Firefox 33 wrecked the newtab page with its fixed-size, one-size-for-everyone tiles.  There is no way to set the row and column count in <code>about:config</code>.  This userstyle attempts to undo some of this by displaying smaller tiles so they can all be displayed.  Also: userstyles that attempt to circumvent this by having scrollable or full-height tile-grid will likely have severe issues with being able to drag/drop tiles (everything appears to get buggy/wrecked).  This userstyle so far does not appear to have this issue; Drag and drop works fine.
