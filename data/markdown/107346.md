### Description
This style is an alternative to "YouTube Retractable (auto-hide header), which can be found here: https://userstyles.org/styles/105290/youtube-retractable-auto-hide-header
Don't like the original one because it makes your YouTube bar very slim? 
Do you think the hide/show animation is too slow?
Do you have a custom YouTube logo that doesn't fit with the original? For example, My Little YouTube (ParallaxMLP)?
Or do you use an addon that autohides the nav-bar in Firefox (The Fox, Only Better)?
Well, no need to worry!
This style fixes all your problems!
