### Description
This is the Facebook Monochrome theme from Social FIxer. Using it as a separate style means no reload lag time.

I am unable to share the .css here, because it is too long. Open the link, then open stylish, click write a new style, and copy / paste the .css from the link. Then save as Facebook Monochrome.
