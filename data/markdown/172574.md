### Description
The first and only FULL skin for Nitro Type v3, download today and be the first of your friends to have a themed v3!!!

This is the product of nearly 30 hours of work, it's an attempt at bringing the v2 aesthetics to v3 while retaining the modern feel and features. I've expanded the material style nearly site-wide and made it a nice grey/black with red accent. I've also changed several visual elements to be more pleasing to the eye or less obtrusive. There are some things I can't seem to theme so you may notice the occasional standard color. If you run into any issues or something that's broken contact me on discord at dv0rak#0001. Thanks for trying it out!

ALL NON GOLD MEMBERS!!! This theme will correct the centering issue NT currently has due to ad placements.
