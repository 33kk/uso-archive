### Description
This style adds a Firefox logo in the <u>about:blank</u> screen.
This logo also appears in iframes during their loading, what is useful to notice them before they look like the page, or before adblock+ blocks them.

I enhanced the style:

-I changed the picture format (from jpeg to png) enabling the transparency, then I uploaded it to three different image hosts.
-I added the auto-sizing functionality (size auto-adapted to the container when this one is smaller than the image).
These two features were lacking to iconolith's style: the image partially appeared in iframes, what wasn't fitted to be seen.

Test it on the <u>about:blank</u> page.
