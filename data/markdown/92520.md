### Description
If you want to use your image of choice as the banner across most parts of ToonForum, this is what you want. Just replace "http://www.nufc.co.uk/javaImages/ca/a2/0,,10278~9020106,00.jpg" with the link to your image of choice (keep the quotes). The image will be scaled to the right size.

You can adjust the positioning by editing "
    background-position: 0% 35% !important;" The first number controls the x axis (horizontal), the second the y axis (vertical).
