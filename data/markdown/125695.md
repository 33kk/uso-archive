### Description
A WHITE Clone of my other theme called <b>Discord Rebirth (Dark)</b>.

### Update notes
Is it fully finished? Most of it yes still adding some minor changes to it. MOST if not all the theme is whitened.
<b><i>WARNING: This theme is currently optimized for light appearance settings only. Dark Mode does not work and it is more prone to bugs and looks horrendous. In its current state, it is recommended to use the light mode until further notice.</b></i>
