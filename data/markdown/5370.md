### Description
This script tries to clean up the neon.de design. It removes several annoying large graphics (like the advertisements or category images) and also removes the time-consuming who-is-online bar. The main "theme" color is changed from red to blue. This all results in a fresh design.

The script was proved to be working on 09-Feb-2009.

neon.de is the online community of a German magazine for young people aged 15+.
