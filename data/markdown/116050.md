### Description
I made this mainly because I have trouble scanning/browsing thumbnails when presented with variable widths.  While I appreciate the work that went into the new layout, I'll just struggle with it as I do with any other site that uses this layout system.

The attempt here is to fit those thumbs back into their square containers and align them in a neater grid system.  It's not going to restore the old one as Weasyl generated specific thumbnails for that, but should help those that are having issues on the new one.

This is my quick and dirty attempts to restore it.  I'll keep it up until someone does a better job than I.

TO THE SQUARES!
