### Description
Simple re-coloring of DuckDuckGo.  This site already supports it's own dark themes using the site's UI, however I still get a flash of white (kinda blinding) when the page reloads.  This theme takes care of that.

NOTE: This style doesn't do anything about the default color for blank URL's or for about:blank, or about:newtab.
