### Description
Remember those upvote/downvote arrows on reddit? Perhaps you'd like to see them on Voat as well, right? Well, this Userstyle does just that for you. 

This changes the usual Blue and Purple triangle upvoat/downvoat buttons into the reddit arrows respectively. Just keep in note that this does not userstyle doesn't work everywhere, and some subverses that have their own custom voting arrows might not allow this userstlye to work.

This also changes the color of (+|-) to look like the one from reddit, just like another userstyle I made. If you want just those colors, go to:

This userstyle DOES NOT LOOK GOOD with darkmode.

This will not work out of the box with tampermonkey, so make your own edits to fit your needs.
