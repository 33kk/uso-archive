### Description
In an item page hides Sponsored Items.  Does not hide sponsored items in search results.  Removes suggestions from amazon root page once logged in as well.  I disable everything that amazon allows to be disabled.  Privacy is not a commodity.

Best combined with uBlock Origin (since Wladimir Palant's Ad"block" extension is not trustworthy): available for firefox, chromium, safari.
