### Description
I'm giving up support on this... imgur seems set on making the computer version unbrowsable, so really, just browse imgur on your phone. All the pointless stupid-ass javascript makes it impossible for my style sheet to work as intended. I'm sorry all, but the javascript and frequent updates to actively make the computer version worse are impossible to manage. I leave this here for anyone interested in pairing a style with a GreaseMonkey script or something, something I'm not willing to accomplish personally.

This style allows to have imgur take advantage of the full width of your screen when you are browsing inside the gallery (i.e. most viral, user submitted, random, etc.) and others (see below), but not reddit links; I'm sorry! I have no idea how to add support for those.
It will also expand the right browsing column, and is there with a fixed position; even if you scroll down, it will still be completely visible and useable.
