### Description
The default bright white background makes Evernote very hard to use for long periods.  This style is based on Neat Evernote 0.1 (19-07-2014) by Kairi Kameo, but adding additional CSS elements to control note font (typeface), note background color (and padding around the note, which is controlled by the "Body" element), note-snippet background color, and note-snippet title background color.
