### Description
I have a nice log in screen for Facebook and Twitter from here, and wanted to complete the trio, hence this.

This has only been tested by me logging in and out on my Firefox, so if there are problems, feel free to leave feedback or fix them yourself, but there shouldn't be any. I haven't tested this for older versions of Firefox, but I expect it will still work. I haven't tested this on Chrome, but it will probably work too; I have no particular intention of creating anything that encourages or aids the use of Google products.

This doesn't remove adverts or anything else; it only edits the login screen.
