### Description
Adds a margin to the outside of pages, where the background is shown. If you want more padding, edit the code. It's only 7 lines.

Unfortunately, it does break smooth mouse wheel and arrow key scrolling with Chromium Wheel, and all wheel/key scrolling on other sites. This is due to the position: absolute; line.
