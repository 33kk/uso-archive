### Description
[Update: As of 6/5/2018, Google added a divider line between the trash icon and the 2 new icons.]

The new Gmail has several additional icons after the Trash icon (mark unread and snooze) when viewing an email.  I've added a larger margin between the Trash icon and the next icons to make it easier to navigate and matched to the old Gmail Trash location.
