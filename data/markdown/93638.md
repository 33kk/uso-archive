### Description
A style I was originally going to integrate into <a href="userstyles.org/styles/78276">this</a>, but then figured it was beyond the scope of that style, so I made a new style for it instead.

Do also pair with <a href=http://userstyles.org/styles/94233>this style</a> which hides the Google Grid scrollbar, as it looks ugly otherwise.

This style comes after the rollout of a new Google feature known as Google Grid, a button that provides one-click access to other Google services, and is basically a modernized revamp of the "More" menu, with a link to a page with all available Google services. This style is ideal for using a background on the Google front page.
