### Description
Reddit Reborn is my attempt to reimagine the reddit UI - it's an extremely comprehensive skin which aims to improve readability and aesthetics across the website.  It started off as a personal project but I have spent my last few weeks of spare time preparing it for distribution.  I have tried to improve it, fix some ugly hacks and broken pages, as well as adapt it to work on more browsers.  I hope that it should now work for most users of modern Gecko/webkit browers but cannot yet offer any guarantees.

Important: in order for this style to work, you *must* disable custom CSS by logging in, going to preferences and unticking "allow reddits to show me custom styles".  If you fail to do this, certain subreddits may become unreadable.
