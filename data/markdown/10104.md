### Description
Version 1.0

The Ebuyer.com forums use a light coloured theme as standard and do not offer a dark theme alternative.

I built this Style for myself and other community members who may enjoy viewing the site in a darker view.

The design is fixed width at 900px, some prefer 100% width, feel free to modify as you choose.

This is my first time writing a style in Stylish, so please report any bugs, and i will do my best to fix them where possible.

Notes:
2 images in the quickreply box would sit outside the design, but being as they are proberly the 2 least used icons they have been hidden.
Some areas of the User Control break outside the 900px width, again not a huge issue but i am aware, i will try to fix this if i can.
Most images, but not all have been replaced using base64 code. Any images not already in the Style can be added easily, there are a few guides here at userstyles and elsewhere that will teach you how to do modifications, let alone the many examples throughout my own style.

Credit: The style was created primarily by myself with some imagery help by a forum member known as Dredwerkz, thank you mate.
