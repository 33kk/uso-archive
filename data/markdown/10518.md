### Description
The website gimpusers.de changed it’s layout to a new one with two columns. The problem is, that one of the columns needs more than 50 percent of the screen (well, not, but it looks like) and is - for me - completely useless.

So i removed it and gave the content more space


*WOAH!!!!* Can’t upload images here (too “big”, frong file type, over and over again) so i decided to upload the images at another hoster!
