### Description
This simple tumblr dashboard features a repeating image option between watercolor roses and cherry blossom branches that will work on any resolution or screen size, a pink gradient content box that disappears as you scroll, four different tumblr logos to choose from, watercolor rose post icons that lift on hover, and a pink background/less opaque text upon hovering over any text on this theme. If you need something adjusted, customized, or have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact me <a href="http://www.eatyourheirs.tumblr.com/ask">@eatyourheirs</a>.

### Update notes
1/8 - Added a watercolor roses bg to match the post icons & removing the blue from the new next page buttons.
1/12 - Made a little rose home button.
1/21 - Fixed formatting & color issues.
1/29 - Now when you make a new post, your theme doesn't reset to tumblr blue.
4/12 - Logo fixes, unfortunately it's smaller now.
5/18 - Logo re-fixing, search bar repositioning & small edits.
11/10 - Repositioning of the tab bar to account for the IM button.
1/20 - Code updates and formatting for search & logo.
4/14 - Standard updates and blue removal.
12/20 - Code updates & content box fix.
1/31 - Got a new laptop and noticed some blue by the radar. I'm too lazy to update anything other than my two most popular tumblr themes, but the blue should go away if you install this theme and then the less popular theme of your choosing. If not, you can always message and guilt me into updating one lol
