### Description
A dark theme for GroupMe. This is designed to be a very simple and straightforward reskin with very few creative liberties taken -- I wanted it to look like an official dark mode might look.

I've gone through just about every feature I know of in GroupMe and made sure this theme looks right. There's still a few minor issues with consistency and probably a few functions that I missed, but you probably won't notice any issues unless you're really hunting for them. If you find an issue, feel free to leave a comment, tweet me (<a href="https://twitter.com/oxguy3">@oxguy3</a>), or email me (haydenschiff@gmail.com). 

This theme is partially based on Darkly, a free theme for Bootstrap. I used Darkly to override the basic Bootstrap theme rules (as GroupMe also uses Bootstrap), and then I manually adapted all of GroupMe's custom CSS to match the dark style.
