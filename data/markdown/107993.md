### Description
<i>Supersedes Transparent playlist, store and lobby.</i>

This style makes the playlist, history and user settings transparent.

For people who want to always see what's going on behind the menus. All menu items accessible from the user menu at the lower right are see-through, so as you buy avatars*, manage your profile or generally look at stuff, the video is seen behind the UI.

*: Avatar and badge cells are not see-through, that is handled by Transparent dashboard and store
