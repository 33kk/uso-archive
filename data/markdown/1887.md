### Description
A lot of eBay pages written by users display very odd font sizes.  This sets all <font> tags to use a given size, here it's 11pt.  You can change this in a heart beat.

Note that eBay's pages size fonts with css contained in <span> tags or elsewhere, but without using <font> tags, so this should only work to make readable the user-written sections of pages served by ebay.com without affecting eBay's parts of the page.

Update handles header 1, 2, 3 in a sane fashion.  Kills <marquee> tags, eeew!  more scrolling nonsense while I'm trying to spend some money.  Also deals with <strong> and <p> in a reasonable way.

As always, corrections based on countering BAD STYLES that I have encountered in common use!

Updated 2007.07.06:  
Fixed issue -- brace out of place somehow pushed css into global scope.  
Added paragraph-width restriction:  It's really hard to read very long lines of text
