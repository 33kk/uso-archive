### Description
Make the system button on Firefox for Win XP looks like Mac's.
I'm not sure if it works on Win 7 or 8.

This user style is intended to use with default theme.
Might not working or looks weird with some <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/complete-themes/">Firefox themes</a>.

Looks perfect with style 33773.
