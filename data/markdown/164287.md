### Description
Tired of using telegram on the web only to have massive borders on the side and bottom? I was. So I made this.
It mostly tweaks the max-widths on the site as a whole but also does a few things to enable full width messages and ensuring the sidebar doesn't get too wide.
**NOTE** Breaks on narrow screens, when the site switches to mobile layout
