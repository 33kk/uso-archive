### Description
<i>*infomercial voice*</i>
don't you hate having to refresh the page with each food item you feed your villager? are your wrists and fingers about to fall off?

hi, Billy Mays here with a new userstyle! if I were smarter, I would have made it better, but I'm <i>not</i>. ;D

now you can feed your villager without reloading the page each time! wow!
just sort your inventory by food (or <a href="http://www.furvilla.com/inventory?type=is_food">visit this link</a>) after installing, and amaze yourself at the like.... maybe 1.3 second difference in how long it takes you to eat!

Under Customize Settings, you can choose to have BIG BUTTONS.
Word of warning, you will pretty much be unable to do anything other than feed your <i>active</i> villager with that enabled.
