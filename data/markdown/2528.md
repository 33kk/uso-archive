### Description
This style adds background colors to the diffs in the MediaWiki v1.4.7 "Recent Changes" RSS feed. Note that newer versions of MediaWiki don't seem to include CSS classes for their diffs in their Recent Changes feed anymore, so unfortunately this won't work for Wikipedia itself.

If you follow some other wikis that are running older MediaWiki software, though, this makes reading their Recent Changes feed nicer.
