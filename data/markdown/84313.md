### Description
Correspondence becomes  " per-window Private Browsing mode "  since Firefox v20.0 . 

Difficult to see in the upper right for the position of the icons representing the Private Browsing mode, I tried to move to the left.


Postscript (Mar. /16/2013 )
I did not think about the full-screen mode.  I am sorry.
