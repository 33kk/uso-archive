### Description
My fork of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/31267/global-dark-style-changes-everything-to-dark">"Global dark style - changes everything to DARK"</a> that tweaks things a bit more the way I like them for usability. This is not a dark solarized or zenburn or or or, though I draw from all of those a bit.

I have also begun to ad an anti-anti-ad blocker bit, though I will probably spin that off into another style.

The wombat thing is just because I like wombats.

Sorry, currently styled for Firefox/Iceweasel only.

Updated as I find and fix things. Please note that I use a separate dark style for Google services (including YouTube), Facebook, and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/129763/darker-remember-the-milk-new-ui">my own darker UI for Remember the Milk</a>. Those change too frequently for me to keep them as part of this style.
