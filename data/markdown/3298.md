### Description
this is my first time to write a style...

just started testing... need lot of help still... 

rediff.com is not well made... no attributes... had to go with td, table and iframes which is not advisable... or maybe im still not doing the right way

works well except for 
- some right columns go missing along with the ad sections
- still havent learned how to center the first 2 columns of the 3 column pattern... so you might see the space on the right side [3 column]
- some pages are not centered.... dont know why that is happening... guess i need more time to spend on that...
 and many small things which you might see.... so please comment with some suggestions... 

till the next time i find time to update this...

if someone wants to look into rediff.com and help... it would be great...
