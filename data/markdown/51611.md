### Description
Rather obsolete. YOU WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE ERRORS WITH THE NEW DASHBOARD. SORRY, NOT UPDATING ANY OF MY STYLES.

A dashboard theme styled after the new Pottermore website!

### Update notes
OTHER INFORMATION

The icons in the navigation are style 51319 by user 110644. I do not claim ownership.

If you have a very large screen resolution (larger than around 1600 wide), please select 'large' in the options before installing.

----------------------------------------

UPDATE 14th August 2011;
I'm 99% sure that I've finally fixed the issue with the navigation in chrome1 So if that was a problem for you please update and/or re-install and check it out.

----------------------------------------

KNOWN ISSUES

If you make a new post via the 'tumblelog' page, the layout will look weird. I cannot as of yet fix this without disabling the layout completely.

Some pages throughout tumblr will not have the full layout applied: this has been done on purpose as the layout cannot work in some places.
