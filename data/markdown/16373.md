### Description
Strips the forums at RealGM down to the bare minimum required to read and post.  No navigation, headlines, post counts, etc.  Please note that this also includes some things that some users may normally find useful, including links to the user control panel, private messages, login/logout, and the forum jumper dropdown.  Here are a few elements that some may way want to keep that can be easily edited out of the style (just cut them out of the first list of elements):

+ .announcement (forum announcements)
+ .jumpbox (dropdown linking to other forums)
+ .navbar (Control Panel, login/logout, etc)
+ .signature (signatures)
+ #mainnav (header links to home, trade checker, news, etc)

Or, if like me you only rarely use these, you can simply disable the style temporarily when you need them.

=== UPDATES ===
2009.04.16 - A few parts of the site's HTML break when thread titles contain double dashes ("--"), so I added a tiny bit to tidy things up for when that's the case.
2009.05.22 - Removed the new Regional Forums links that display at the top of the page.
2009.05.30 - Fixed display issue on forums that don't have any active announcements. This does leave a small horizontal blue line on forums that do have an announcement, but it's pretty unobtrusive and a small price to pay for allowing the non-announcement forums to display correctly. Will look into this a bit more later, to see if I can remove this extra blue line.
2010.03.23 - URL switched from realgm.com/boards to forums.realgm.com
