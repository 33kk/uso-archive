### Description
*** Updated to work again with the new responsive layout of vdiplomacy ***
*** Update 0.3a: trying to support both domains .net and .com alike (was .net only before) ***

this is my personal css for improving and modernizing some of the aspects of vdiplomacy.net.
it is primarily making more room on big screens for the chat, for the map, cleaning up non-essential seperator lines and using a more modern and readable font (Open Sans). 

there might be bugs or things that are due to my taste, but i'm using this since a few years already without much hassle, so i assume it's somewhat working okay.
