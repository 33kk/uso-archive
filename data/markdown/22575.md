### Description
Lesswrong.com's threads are more readable because levels of comments alternate colors. So I threw this together to emulate it on Reddit.

You can change "max-width: 1120px !important;" to whatever you want if you'd like to extend/shorten the boxes' width.

I made this mostly through trial and error, so I welcome any suggestions.
