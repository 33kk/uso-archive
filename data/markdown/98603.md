### Description
This style fits the Solve360 interface on Mozilla Firefox to my personal needs. The use case is a small laptop screen, in my case it's a HP EliteBook 8440p.

Focus is on
- ease of reading,
- the amount and order of displayed information, and
- a good overview.

This is achieved by some :hover - styles. Information is kept short in base view, and more info is released upon mouse hovering over an item.
