### Description
<b>NOTE: As of 01.01.2013 this style will no longer be supported.</b>
This style was designed mainly with almost any tumblr theme in mind. A pink/floral theme and a generic/blue theme are also available.
The purpose of this style is to provide little extras that may have been overlooked in other styles. The extras include:
- replacing the big green 'Following # people'to match the theme
- styling the Radar to remove the blue background frame and rounding the corners of the photo/video
- turning the 'Add / Remove' category list selection system. Also, it bids farewell to that hideous green selection bar!
- providing rounded corners for just about everything that could be found
And lots of other little things you'll notice along the way.
