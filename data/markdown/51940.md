### Description
This style is intended to speed up TurnTable slightly by removing the avatars from TurnTable rooms, preventing the browser from having to operate the animations. It also replaces the font used in the songboard ticker to a thinner, less processor-intensive font... fewer pixels to calculate, the better. Works in Chrome, untested in Firefox. Hopefully updates to come.
