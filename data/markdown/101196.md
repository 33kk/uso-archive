### Description
After the last update to Firefox (v29), the about:home page was showing a "Web We Want" Graphic with a link to webwewant.mozilla.org that took up the entire width of the page causing me to inadvertently click the link numerous times a day. Existing user styles to change the logo were not helping.

This style hides hyperlinks in the #topsection DIV and places the default #brandlogo back as the image.
