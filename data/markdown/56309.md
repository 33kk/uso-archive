### Description
tired of straining your eyes to read your messages on Google Voice? unfortunately, Google does not yet offer theming options for the Voice page, so in the meantime...

<b><i>STOP THE BLINDNESS</i></b> with my <b>Google Voice Dark</b> style which retains the minimalistic design of Google in a dark variant that is especially easy on the eyes at night.

much credit goes to user 22904 for the style style 22379, from whom + which i originally borrowed most of the code. 

in my opinion, this style looks very good with the Calibri font, great with Google's own Roboto font + <b><i>excellent</i></b> with my new favorite font, Open Sans Light... i'm sure it'll look great with your favorite font(s) as well.

please report any bugs you may find + feel free to drop a comment/suggestion below.

enjoy! :-D
