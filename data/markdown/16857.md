### Description
Makes the background of the search results grey.

Notes:
 - works only in the international version - google.com
 - now works in the Bulgarian version too - google.bg
 - the google logo looks somewhat ugly with white background (it's a picture and it's not affected)

If you want to work for different country code - its very simple look at the url-prefixes and add/edit.
