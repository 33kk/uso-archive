### Description
The best (and only) dark theme for the "eclass" used by the Colegio International Torrequebrada School. This is recommended to students having to submit projects to the site late during the night, without wanting sore eyes ;) This theme is currently still a work in progress and will be regularly updated, so make sure to check this page every now and again. If you have any suggestions, or encounter any possible bugs, and are a member of the CIT school, then feel free to message me through instagram (@elptricko). I hope you enjoy this theme :D
