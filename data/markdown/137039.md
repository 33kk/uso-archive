### Description
The Stylish Manage screen is meant for people with very few styles. For folks like me with more than 100 styles (many disabledâ€”I'm not nuts), it would be nice to pack more styles on the screen.

This style also changes the "Enable/Disable" buttons to a checkbox, and greys-out the title only, not the whole style, so that the buttons and "Applies to" info are still readable and usable.
