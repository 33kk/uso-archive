### Description
An Island to Oneself is an EXCELLENT story well worth the read, however the choice of font colours is horrific and almost unreadable as it is on the website. 
This script attempts to solve that.  It also fixes the layout a bit.  Maybe you don't like my colour choices either, but it's simple to change them.
