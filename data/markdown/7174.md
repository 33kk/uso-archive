### Description
Removes the Orange Feed Discovery RSS icon button from Firefox's Addressbar (Locationbar).  Gives you more room to type in that long URL, or to search using the Awsomebar.   Also works for Firefox 2.

Integrates with Style 7173, and Style 7169, allowing you to remove the RSS Icon, the Bookmark favorite icon, and the Go Button.


Acknowledgments:
Thanks to the wonderful idea from the Firefox Extension Guru's Blog for the codebase CSS Release

Additional Information:
This style works for both Firefox3 and Firefox2.
Gives you more space in the Navigation toolbar's locationbar or the Firefox 3 Awesome Bar (AwesomeBar)

Changelog:
- Initial Release
