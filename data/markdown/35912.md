### Description
▐■▬ Translucent-izes the navigation bar at the top of Google's homepage (not iGoogle, just the main page)
▐■▬ The main search bar glows if you hover over it, and glows even more when it's focused.
▐■▬ The "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons glow, too.
▐■▬ 
▐■▬ EDIT: This badly needs updating! Use style 31464 in the meantime – it's vastly superior to mine anyway. ;)
▐■▬ 
▐■▬ comment please, even if you're not rating my userstyle! I need feedback from anyone who's used this and discovered the defects.
