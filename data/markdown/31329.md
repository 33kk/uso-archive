### Description
A dark theme for the ubuntu google start page and the search pages afterwards.

I copied the main code and altered it slightly for my own purposes, as you can see i've left all the credits as they were although the description isn't right anymore.

The original script is called 'simple dark google v2' if ya want it for the rest of google.
