### Description
UPDATED; may have to do a little editing to fit your resolution, etc. 

A style based on my fairly minimalistic preferences. 
I have not written any of the CSS myself; all is ripped from miscellaneous themes found on the site. 
If any improvements can be suggested, don't hesitate to post.

Note:
I am using this in conjunction with the Hide Menubar add-on;
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762 

I'm not sure if having it installed would make a difference, but I'd install just in case. And if you're this big a minimalist why would you have all that junk up there anyway? ;)

Info:
- Smaller NavBar
- No RSS, Star, Go, or ID buttons
- Smaller tabs
- No tab icons or close buttons
- Centered text

Well I hope all enjoy this. I'd say this is about as minimal as Firefox can get whilst retaining all it's functionality.
