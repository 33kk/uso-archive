### Description
One of Vexx's paintings with pastel orange details for your roblox page! (In case you don't see the Settings button in the screenshot, don't worry, when you download it's still there! Also, the pink lines are a bug, when you download they disappear) I don't really like this one, in case you don't like it too, check out the other themes I made on my profile!
