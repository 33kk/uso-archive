### Description
Colors tabs based on the network they are on. Useful if you are on many networks and you want to keep track of which tab is on which network, especially if you are in identically named channels on two different networks.

If your network isn't one of the default networks that Chatzilla has listed then you will need to edit the style and replace one of those names with the name of your network.
