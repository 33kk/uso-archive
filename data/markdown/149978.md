### Description
Updated theme "Firefox Dark Duality (Compact theme)" by Tony_S with dark scrollbars.

Description of original style:
Black like my other theme but this is for the new compact theme that comes with Firefox. So before you install this, go to about:addons (preferences/options) --> appearance --> compact dark. If you're on Nightly 57, you can also use my userChrome.css, while not like this, still a black and minimal theme: https://pastebin.com/AUSzqWXB
