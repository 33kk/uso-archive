### Description
If you're an Apple fanboy you'll definitely like this style, because it gives YouTube a more refined  touch. This theme adds rounded corners, a better darkmode, blurry backgrounds, shadows and overall a just better looking UI.


<strong><mark>!!!ONLY USE WITH YOUTUBE DARKMODE ACTIVATED!!!</mark></strong>

<strong><mark>WORKS BETTER WITH CHROME OR OPERA SINCE THERE IS NO OFFICIAL SUPPORT FOR BACKDROP FILTERS IN MOZILLA FIREFOX (Otherwise you won’t have blurry backgrounds, but transparent backgrounds. This doesn’t look very well)</mark></strong>

<strong>IF YOU USE CHROME PLEASE ENABLE THIS FLAG:</strong> chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features

<strong>IF YOU USE OPERA PLEASE ENABLE THIS FLAG:</strong> opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features

<strong>Known Issues:</strong>
- Rainbow Theme: Rainbow Elements are not synchronised
