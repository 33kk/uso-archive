### Description
This will mimic Opera's Fixed-Table Layout option for Ultimate Dominion.

Updated to also make the menu look a bit more like the menu in Opera.  You can play around with the li height.. making it bigger would put more space between the links in the menu.. making it smaller would cause the links to get closer together.
