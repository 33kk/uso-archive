### Description
Include  <b>Keyword</b>, <b>Location URL</b>, and <b>Description</b> when adding bookmark (Ctrl+D), or with the Firefox 3 bookmark star to add or modify a bookmark.

The description will fill in automatically from webpages that include the description META tag, and you can change it to what you want.  

By including the keyword in your bookmark Name it will show up in a location bar autocomplete search (AwesomeBar) and a bookmark search.&nbsp;  I place the keyword at the beginning of most of my Name/Title line and most of my public keyworded bookmarks are in the "K" folder of my Bookmarks Toolbar to help me remember the keyword assigned.
