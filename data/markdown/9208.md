### Description
This theme is still under development.

I got addicted to Stylish for a couple of hours and went crazy darkening every website I visit, when I realized that all of the themes for facebook either make very small or unnoticeable changes, or they don't really work. The reason for this was obvious. Facebook has WAY too much crap. Hundreds of DIVs, images, inputs... It was a mess.

And so I decided to make it my task to create a working theme for this. The theory was simple. Start by applying simple features to EVERYTHING, then navigate the site and change elements one-by-one if they don't work properly.

Things to note: Chat still does not work (reading through countless .js files to find the proper class/id/tag to modify), Autosuggest now works, other errors may exist that I have not yet found.

Also, if you want to remove the large blocks of image data at the end, feel free. The first 6 make the gifts feature look a bit prettier, and the last one make the bottom-right chat button look a bit prettier.
