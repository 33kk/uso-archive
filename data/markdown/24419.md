### Description
Let's see... I cut the ugly logo, turned the site black on white, rearranged the top a bit, hid some elements and I made the "assign edit resolve" buttons fixed at the bottom of the screen. Oh yeah: the content in my screenshots _contains_ a screenshot, so don't let that throw you ;)

Enjoy
