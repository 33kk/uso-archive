### Description
MBlue Nav-Style Url-Bar Vista
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
 1. Transforms the URLBAR/SEARCHBAR and make it like the NAV-BUTTONS: same blue background, same buttons and dropmarker.
 2. Make the GO-BUTTON always visible by default, and make it looks the same as the Forward-Button (Nav-Buttons), and apply that to the SEARCH-BUTTON too.
 3. Skins "FISSION" Progress-Bar.
 4. Skins and combine "CLEAR FIELDS" icons (optional) (*).
 5. Supports Locationbar2 and XMarks.
 6. Supports both SMALL and LARGE ICONS.
 7. Highly customizable.
 8. Integrates with the other Nav-Style styles.
 9. Integrates with "Combine Nav-Buttons Vista".
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
-Using other Styles/Extensions/Themes may change some margin/border settings, making the buttons/textboxes overlap each other. If so, try not using other styles that changes margins in the nav-bar, and use the default firefox theme. 

-Works in the Nav-Bar only, small/large icons, no label, no flex.

-If using "Clear Fields" extension, remember to follow the instructions below (*).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*COMBINE "CLEAR FIELDS" ICONS (OPTIONAL):

This style combines the "Clear Fields" Extension Icons with the Url-Bar and Search-Bar. To make it works, you obviously need the Extension installed, then place the buttons in this order:

 [URLBAR] [CLEAR-ADDRESS]     &     [SEARCHBAR] [CLEAR-SEARCH]

The icons will auto-combine as soon as you put the Clear-Address/Search Icon to the Urlbar/Searchbar right side.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can optionally change:

 1. TEXT COLOR/SIZE/WEIGHT.
 2. URLBAR/SEARCHBAR BACKGROUND BLUE/TRANSPARENT.
 3. URLBAR/SEARCHBAR and NAV-BUTTONS OPACITY.
 4. FISSION-BAR COLOR and OPACITY.
 5. SEARCHBAR WIDTH.
 6. COMBINE "CLEAR FIELDS" icons with the URL-BAR & SEARCH-BAR (*).
