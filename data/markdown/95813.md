### Description
Changes the "Google Contacts" UI to a compact style. When opening the contacts inside the Gmail tab, the compact layout can be selected through they UI. However, when opening Google Contacts as a standalone page, there is no option to select the compact UI. [Note: Since 2015, a new UI for the contacts has launched. This style is now outdated.]
