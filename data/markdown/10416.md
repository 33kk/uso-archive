### Description
Places the Tab bar on top of Firefox's window and makes it transparent for Glasser extension (http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=649449) to apply Window Vista's Aero effect upon it. If you have a menu bar shown; it will be placed below it, I suggest using a menu-bar hider extension such as Hide Menubar to make the effect more pleasant.

The colours of the selected and hover labels of the text can obviously be adjusted by altering the required CSS properties in the tab hover and tab selected sections at the very bottom of the file.

Enjoy!

Please Note: There is a strange bug which when only one tab is open, the bar is rendered completely white. To work around this you must set the value "browser.tabs.autoHide" to false, in the hidden about:config page in Firefox.

History:

0.1 - 8th-Sept-2008: Initial Release
0.2 - 9th-Sept-2008: Cleaned up CSS and fixed a minor bug with all windows of Firefox having a 30px padding on the top.
0.3 - 9th-Sept-2008: Made the tabs more readable on a darker background (a very transparent but white background is applied on hover and active effects). An option can be applied to make the tabs have an embossed effect and rounded top corners very similar to the standard Firefox tabs; just uncomment the last CSS style at the very bottom of the file.
0.4 - 19-Dec-2008: Updated it for Firefox 3.1b2, Added an optional section (as shown in the screenshot) to allow white tab labels with a darkened shadow for added readability. This feature is for Firefox 3.1b2+ so it is commented out by default.

(Tested using Firefox 3.1a1 and Firefox 3.01)
