### Description
A Dark Theme for Dragalia Lost Gamepress, I noticed that there were no themes for gamepress and my eyes didn't like summoning at 2 am at night while my heart did. Therefore, I produced this simple theme that makes the site darker WHILE keep some of the good things from the normal version (I.E. 5 stars turning red). This works on the entirety of the dragalia gamepress website as well as the entirety of the dragalialost.gamepedia, Enjoy!
