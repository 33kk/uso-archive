### Description
Turns the new cosmic panda Youtube design into something usable
It deletes all the unused stuff and enlarge the important thing: the Video timeline. 
It arranges the Videos in a Grid layout on dark buttons.
At the moment i am working on moving the Comments button from the left to the top.

I hope You enjoy.


Tested on Mac OSX Lion with Chrome 19 and Firefox 12. 
If you have issues of overlapping text, try changing the zoom of your browser down (i am working with 83% on chrome an it works on all windowsizes).
Also there is a error when looking on peoples profile, i am going to fix this.

If you have suggestions or error reports, please report.
