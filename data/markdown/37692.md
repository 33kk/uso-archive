### Description
This is my own copy of style 1615 by user 1130, updated for Firefox 4 (and Minefield) beta versions.

New (blank) tabs are shrunk to ~36px, lose their label and icon, and get colored blue* until an address is navigated to.

Play around with the code all you want â€” this wasn't originally my idea anyway. (mad respect to user 1130 et al.)

*can be changed to any color you wish.

============================================================
EDIT: In Minefield 4.0b10pre, and possibly other versions, there's a XUL error when you close the "divider tab". 
.....I have no idea how to fix this.
