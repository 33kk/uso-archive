### Description
**UPDATE 3** Now includes regex code to ensure that this style is only applied to individual lesson pages (pages with "/modules/" in the URL) since the chat & mentor buttons don't interfere with the interface on the course overview pages. 
**UPDATE 2** Now includes code to dock the mentor chat window in the bottom-left as well, keeping it out of the way of the "next" button. 
**UPDATE 1** Now includes code to automatically hide the orange notification orb.
A snippet of CSS that that moves the Udacity chat button down into the bottom-left corner of the browser window (adjacent to the Mentorship button). Now it's out of your way when you don't need it, and easily within reach when you do.
