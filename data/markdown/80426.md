### Description
On 12/21/2012, Rift updated the forum with a new style for vBulletin. Unfortunately, there's a few issues with it that a lot of people have had with the largest being that it's stuck on a 960px grid. Not fun if you utilize large resolutions. This style will change the forum width back to fluid so that you're free to resize your browser to your liking. Along with the fluid width I have made a lot of changes to the overall style of the forum to try to rectify some of the coding they've overlooked. Please remember that this is a work in-progress that I will be constantly updating until there's no need for it at all (aka whenever they fix it Live.)
