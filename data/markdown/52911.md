### Description
This style reduces the size of the menu button in Firefox Versions greather then 4. (Firefox 4, Firefox 5 & Firefox 6 tested)
I think thats a better styling for small screens, e.g. on netbooks and notebooks. Have fun!

ATTENTION: Resize windows after activation! So the tab bar will be resized and you will profit of the smaller size with more overview.
