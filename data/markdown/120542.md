### Description
A collection of tweaks for YouTube, primarily disabling features that I find impractical or never use. For example, ads on the home page and video pages are disabled; "Related channels" on user pages is disabled; and some sidebar items are removed.

All of the features in this style can be disabled by commenting out that line. (You can do this by clicking "Edit" in the "User Styles" page, finding the line that has to do with the feature, putting your cursor on that line, and pressing Ctrl-slash. This will comment out that line. Press again to un-comment.)
