### Description
Images on <a href="http://www.pixelcarart.com/">Pixel Car Art</a> and <a href="http://pixelation.org/">Pixelation</a> can now be viewed without the browser blurring the pixel art, especially on mobile, but also on desktop when zoomed in.

Also on PCA the Invision Power Board auto resizing of images is partially deactivated, the images are still resized (if I use the oringal size the javascript of the forum loops and crashes) but there isn't the black frame anymore.
