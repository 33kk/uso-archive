### Description
CLASSIC MYSPACE STYLE ONLY!!

This works well for me @ 1680 x 1050
the only difference between this one and my other myspace style (http://userstyles.org/styles/10452) is this one shows the alerts to the left of the page in it's own fixed div.
I'm sure that will change in the coming days, but for now that is it. The other version just simply hides the alerts.

This style does not affect individual user profiles.
Only viewmorepics, home, messaging, friends and apps.
I'll be updating this style frequently, so check back often.

** UPDATE **

Modified layout, background colors. Added background image to top nav, sub nav, and hover.
bordered main wrap, changed body background color

cleaned code.
