### Description
Makes the spam and reported links, comments and messages easier to read by instead using a single bar on the left and right and a slim bar below it.

The idea originates from ytknows's tweak on /r/cj.

Do note that the preview was taken in Opera 11, so the corners will look different in all of the other browsers.
