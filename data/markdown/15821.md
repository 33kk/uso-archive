fix as you need, I'm new at this so there's most likely many useless things in the code.

Feel free to email me at ShazbotChan(at)gmail(dot)com for suggestions, or questions, or comments. 

If anyone likes this one, I can post my many other ones that I've made, or if anyone wants me to make one for them with an image of their choice email me with the picture, your screen resolution and the colors that you want. 

:D


also- I just took a bunch of pieces from a bunch of other themes, I don't remember which ones though. Don't hate o_o
