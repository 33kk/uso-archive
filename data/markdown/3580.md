### Description
The problem with (the English) Wikipedia is not the very occasional bit of nonsense in the articles.  The problem is the article page-histories, the contentious article Talk: pages (and their own page-histories), the User_talk: pages (and their page-histories).  It's like a sloppy recycling of Usenet.  Remember Usenet?  It started out very smart, but turned into bickering and sniping-- pure mental death on the installment plan.

This userstyle hides:
*Article page-histories (inanity mixed with squabbling)
*Article Talk: ("discussion") pages (the backstory on the squabbling)
*The page-histories of Article Talk: ("discussion") pages (ohgodno)
*The User_talk: pages (horrific)
*The pages-histories of the User_talk: pages (minutiae of horror)

The content of each page is replaced with a box stating, serenely:
  "(You don't want to know)"
