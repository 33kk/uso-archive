### Description
This is a mod of dougeeebear's images in the Stylish Manager Enabled/Disabled script that can be found in the following post: http://userstyles.org/style/show/179

In this mod I got rid of the white box around the images and added a white border that blends in with whatever background may be behind it. The before and after shots show it off better.
