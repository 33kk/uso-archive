### Description
This style fixes a few longstanding problems with the otherwise great website omgubuntu.co.uk. Mainly, it removes the large scrolling banner and eliminates those gigantic blockquotes. It also removes a few other annoying quirks. 

Hope this helps those who can't stand visual quirks. Hopefully I'll have time to keep this updated. :-)
