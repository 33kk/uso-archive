### Description
<b>This theme is currently only compatible with 1080p screens</b>.
You also need browser zoom set to 80% (this tricks G+ into enabling 3 columns, currently only tested on Google Chrome). I hope to one day get this fully dynamic on all screens.

This style was created by myself to emulate the old feel of Google+ Communities as inevitably Google will remove 'Classic Google+' and force us to use 'New Google+' without really addressing any of our concerns :)

I hope you find use out of it.
Would love to hear any feedback or suggestions.
