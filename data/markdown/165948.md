### Description
DUE TO THE SLUGGISHNESS OF USERSTYLES, ALL FUTURE UPDATES CAN BE FOUND HERE:

https://github.com/mgreger/ResetEra_Dark

New theme to fit in with the ResetEra 2.0 redesign. All pre-2.0 custom stylesheets are no longer supported due to the move to XenForo 2.0 HTML codebase.
<b>Note: Please ensure that the site is set to ResetEra Dark before applying theme.</b>

Features:
4 custom widths
3 different unread thread indicators (avatar, logo, or minimalist border)
Show/hide your avatar icon that appears next to threads you've posted in
Fixed/relative nav bar
Keep/remove empty space between posts
Quotes always expanded
YouTube videos resized to 480p within quotes
Completely redesigned forum/thread view to bring it inline with the older ResetEra design.

### Update notes
05/05/2020:
Fixed read/unread logo.

03/12/2020:
Updated styling for thread-reply-banner.

06/24/2019:
Dark-ified the scroll bar.

05/24/2019:
Fixed nav button padding.
Skinned bookmark dropdown menu.
Skinned link previews.

03/30/2019:
Made slight tweak to warning box that occurs when site errors occur ("Template public:_media_site_embed_twitter not found.").

03/29/2019:
Made tweaks to quoted YouTube videos.

01/10/2019:
Added a link highlight color to the new refresh icon in the top right of the screen.

01/08/2019:
Found an unthemed moderator tag which has been fixed. Also removed the css for the showing/hiding of thread preview finally, since it was no longer functional anymore.

12/21/2018:
Fixed the 'Navigation/Quick Jump Button' icon view to accommodate the addition of 'Latest Threads'.

12/15/2018:
The site has disabled the thread preview on hover, so my option for this currently doesn't do anything anymore.

12/10/2018:
Styled the 'View more' link that appears when posting in a thread that has had new posts after yours.

12/09/2018:
Fixed bolded text issues.
Styled the Insert button when inserting links/images.
Many unstyled elements have been styled between this update and the last major one.

Added the following new features:
Show/hide thread preview when hovering over a thread title.
Change the Quick Jump button to a series of icons, which are always visible (no more 2 clicks!) < Thanks to SwordStruck on the forums.
You can now choose to keep the click to expand feature on quotes the same like the normal site, or have them always expanded.
And while it was implemented into the normal site as an option after the fact, you can also use my theme to disable avatars.

12/03/2018:
Pretty much done with the style. If I notice any small things I missed I will continue to update but at the moment it all looks pretty complete.

Added a couple different user highlight options to when your own posts are quoted.

12/03/2018:
Logged out view should be finished, but like everything else, it requires the you to be using the site toggle'd Dark theme in order to get the full effect.

Re-did the border around sticky posts, and updated the post thread bar above sticky threads.

12/02/2018:
Enabled theme for live site, removed beta references. Will be updating any elements missed (how it looks logged out, and the posting interface) tonight and tomorrow.

11/17/2018:
User-highlighting (both posts and quotes) implemented. Unlike the old themes, there is no need to enter your username as a custom field anymore, all you need to do is change the color (if you'd like!).

11/15/2018:
Added the ability to hide the forum banners (Video Games, Hangouts, etc...)
Anything to left to fix (how it looks when logged out, and the posting UI) will happen once the theme is live or modified.

11/15/2018:
Re-added the logo from my previous themes in place of the avatar next to the thread titles. Total of 3 options:

Default (Avatars)
Logo next to thread title with avatar next to last post
Logo next to thread title with no avatar next to last post

If using default avatars, unread thread titles will be a shade of purple whereas the logo will either be purple or grey depending on unread/read status.

11/14/2018:
Made a few finishing touches, and with them the theme is pretty well done. The only planned thing left is I still have to touch up user highlighting (quotes), but I am waiting to see how the site implements this first. Other than that, I don't really have any more changes to make.

The plan going forward is to update anything that changes in the default theme from now until live and tweak anything I might have missed.

One the site is live and I can view the theme without needing to be logged in, I will touch up anything that looks off when logged out.

11/14/2018:
Still working on fixing minor details, but the majority is done.

11/13/2018:
User highlighting implemented, does not highlight your quotes at the moment.
Unread threads have a purple link color for now. Will likely change.
Unsure what quoting the new embeds will look like. YouTube/Twitter still look fine.
