### Description
If you are using NoScript and RequestPolicy within Firefox you may also don't see those fancy Awesome web font. I merely see Chinese or Arabic Characters where Arrows or other Icons should be. 

Reason: The site is sourcing the Awesome Icon Font which is not allowed. 
Solution: Install Awesome font locally and use stylish to force using a local version.
