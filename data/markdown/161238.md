### Description
If GitHub were an operating system around the year '98, it would probably look like this.

Inspired by Microsoft purchasing GitHub.

This theme was based on a design by twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky">@nikitonsky</a>, who upon learning Microsoft was buying GitHub, created a mockup of a Windows 98 theme.

origin: <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1003593821723267072">So I heard $MSFT is buying @GitHub</a>

With his permission, I've tried my best to implement his mockups, because I kinda want my github like this too.

Please send any issues you have with the theme to my GitHub repository for it <a href="https://github.com/AtomicBlom/github98/issues">https://github.com/AtomicBlom/github98/issues</a>
