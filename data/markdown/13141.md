### Description
this is a minimalistic google chrome inspired skin tweaked by me (i'm uploading it mostly to help maintaining firefox over 3 computers)

to have the menu, bookmarks menu and bookmarks just like this you need to merge the toolbars into one

if you prefer to have text next to the bookmark icons remove the following line:

.bookmark-item .toolbarbutton-text { display: none !important; }

addons used: 

tiny menu (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1455)
locationbar2 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4014)

update: 3 Jan 2009
fixed problem with the drop-box (now the content is readable)
it's compatible with ff 3.1 beta2 (so are the addons after a little edit on install.rdf)
