### Description
White style for the very dark MetalStorm website.  I use metalstorm to keep up to date with all the new album releases, and their release-dates.  This style makes readability very easy with vista's Calibri font, as well as the wonderful white, and black styling.


Features:
- Calibri font, although supports XP and Windows 9x with the secondary font being Arial.  (if Calibri is not installed, the site will display in Ariel)
- White background for each page, table data, and paragraph
- Bold table headings
- Extra-large band name headings on specific band's page
- WebSafe Orange as Hovered Hyperlink color
- Light overall look


Future Updates:
- I plan to add the Metal Storm logo into the Style.  I currently need to add a image-insert script into the CSS in order to achieve this.  Should be out soon in release 1.0.0.2.
- Plan to add more CSS to make ALL the track listings on Upcoming Albums to white/black style - instead of gray text (some are white, some are gray)

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Applied background color fix to the Upcoming Albums page.
+ Changed Track Listing text color of upcoming albums, for most instances.
+ Hover Hyperlink Color added for better navigation and Readability
+ Visited Hyperlink Color added for better navigation and History 
+ More Pages with White backgrounds
