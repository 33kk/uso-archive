### Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[My Large Logo user style - - - - Medium Logo user style also available]<br><b>FIXED:</b> Panos' style and other derivatives of it have progressive De-Centering of their Google logo with page-zoom change / a large gray box around the search query box / and a white footer-bar on the Search Results page. <b>ALL 3</b> are fixed in my userstyle. Also, Google logo is larger, more vibrant-colored, with better highlights and 3D effect (Panos' is "washed out"). Detailed "Comments" section at top of CSS demarcates Panos' code from mine, and tutorial shows users how to use their own logo. I also credit Panos for his generally excellent work in my CSS "Comments". I also have a Google favicon mod (a Greasemonkey user script):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revert to Google's Old 2012-2015 Favicon"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(reverts to the "white lower-case 'g' in a blue square" favicon)...
