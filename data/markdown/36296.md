### Description
Removed all extraneous profile data, ads, bookmarks, right sidebar, etc. Good for checking Facebook without it being immediately obvious to somebody that that's where you are.

** 10/20/10 - Facebook updated ID names in their layout that broke some styles. Fixed.
** 9/9/10 - Small updates made over the past couple weeks. Most notably, added back the top-left Facebook home link in the form of a blue box.
