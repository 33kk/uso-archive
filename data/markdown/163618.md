### Description
A free dark theme for driving-tests.org. Normally you would have to pay to get a dark theme. There are still some bugs but as of right now it's completely usable. This theme is based on https://userstyles.org/styles/31267/global-dark-style-changes-everything-to-dark, but with a lot of tweaks to make it functional on driving-tests.org. This is why it is written like a global style, but it only applies to driving-tests.org
