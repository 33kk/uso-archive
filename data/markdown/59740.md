### Description
Removes the obnoxious "videoWrapper" div on facebook.com (currently the boy in the pool of water), hides the weird floating chair in the forest, and also remove the ads which facebook execs or designers or whoever laughably calls the "ego section". Also removes the logo and that trending bullshit on the right side
