### Description
~~~ Stylish/Stylus no longer applies browser themes on the latest update, use <a href="https://pastebin.com/UwAHd0zm" target="_blank">>this code<</a> and follow the instructions. ~~~ On an older update? Check out the options in the Advanced Style Settings on this page, install <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans">>Open Sans font<</a> and go to Customize and check/uncheck show titlebar if it glitches out. ~~~ To autohide the urlbar add a */ to the end of line 197. ~~~ Used w/ my <a href="http://fav.me/d9mkk8q">>Nocturnal Visual Style<</a>.
