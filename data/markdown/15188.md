### Description
This is simply a modification of Glasser that makes the entire toolbar area of the browser look like normal except it is fully glass.

Requires Glasser (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7336)

It is a combination of these styles:
- style 13434
- style 8958
- heavy modification of style 10455 by me
plus various UI fixes in glasser

This was inspired by the lack of functionality of other styles for Glasser on Windows 7.  I can't guarantee it looking the same...or even good...on Vista.

Didn't see that -moz-opacity was obsolete as of 3.1 now.  Thanks.

EDIT:

If you find that tabs are not visible on a certain type of window I might have missed or that the tabs are there and are just messed up, please tell me and be specific.  Also, tell me if you are on Windows 7.  Like I said, i promise nothing about this style on Windows Vista as I have never used it on Vista and do not plan to use Vista any time soon.
