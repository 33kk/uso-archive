### Description
This userstyle is directly based on <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/152164/facebook-jak-s-gradient-rounded-style">Facebook JAK's Gradient Rounded Style</a> by <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/559306">Khoa Lê (JAK)</a>.
</p>
***All credits belongs to Khoa Lê (JAK) and I own nothing of it***
</p>
I personally recommend you to at least try Khoa Le (JAK)'s original style <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/152164/facebook-jak-s-gradient-rounded-style">here</a> for your best experience.
</p>
This version strictly follow JAK's style design and only disable all Animations, Transformations and Transitions due to their laggy behavior on slow PCs. 
</p>
If there's any feature you guys wanna re-enable, please edit the source-code yourself, since it's very well coded with good conventions.
</p>
I may be able to update this version to match JAK's style development once in a while, so please stay tune.
