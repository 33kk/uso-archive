### Description
All google pages (including related services, like Gmail and Reader) will be displayed by default in Segoe UI font (you need Vista or Office 2007) which is much modern than the old Arial font used by default in Google.

Please note that I took inspiration for this theme from http://userstyles.org/styles/178

Check also this other theme (http://userstyles.org/styles/6897) to have row highlighting based on message status.
