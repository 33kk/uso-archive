Determine icons with color for Gmail (new version)

Yes, delete button is red!

### Update notes
I was dissapointed with so little features in new Gmail

11/11/09: First version
11/11/10: Moved icons to Imageshack
          I am happy of 2000 installs:-)
11/11/11: Fixed bug with nested comments
11/11/11: I changed color of some icons to keep readability. Works with "Light" or "Night" themes.
          4400 installs?
11/11/14: Google changed weird names of style classes. Updated mostly.
          Thanks for comments.
11/11/15: Changed icons to be embeded into style (should be quicker)
11/11/16: Reload icon is blue.
12/01/31: Reply to all icon fixed:-)
12/05/02: More actions icon fixed.
15/03/09: 27755 installs. I am happy that it is still working.
16/09/27: 31037 installs. Just checking. Thinking about update.
18/03/27: 33,106 installs. Just going by...
