### Description
The most comprehensive and up-to-date <a href="http://yoember.com/">tutorial</a> to learn ember, in my opinion. In contrary to many other standard tutorials covers a broad spectrum of creating a full-fledged SPA. So to make it even easier to get into the super-advanced MVC-JS-Framwork (when you code your sleep away, like me) here's the more "healthier" late-night variant.
