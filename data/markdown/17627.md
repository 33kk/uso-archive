### Description
I was getting really tired of the pale yellow default XDA Developers Forum style, so I took a few minutes and swapped all the yellow tones out for red ones.  I'm no CSS expert, but it looks good to me, and much more pleasing than the yellow.  Hope some folks like it.

Known bugs:
 - Some graphics on site are still yellow/brown
 - Top navigation bar when hovered the text disappears.  Can't figure out what property this is!
