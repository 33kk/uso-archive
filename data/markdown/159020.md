### Description
Basically I didn't very like how Interpals is colored. The yellow bar at the top, the white background, the small flags, the color selection across the platform... So I threw together this. Not claiming its great but if one person likes it then I consider it a triumphant success, which I like it, so to me its already a success. I hope it is for you too.
