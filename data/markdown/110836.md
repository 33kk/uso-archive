### Description
The Board is resized and colored dark/green.
I've kept what I really need when I browse the forum and I did some modifications to make the appearance more comfortable for my eyes.
So I've removed all unnecessary distracting things.

Things removed:
_ Social links.
_ Toolbar, Navbar, Titlebar (some of them have been reduced or totally removed).
_ Info Center, Stats. 
_ Signatures, Avatars, Profiles, Stars, etc.
_ Rating bar.
