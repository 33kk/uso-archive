### Description
Banish white backgrounds!
This simple style inverts the brightness on most web pages through Google Chrome browser
Turns black on white to white on black, but unlike Google's High Contrast extension, this keeps other colour shades more compatible with the originals. For example, links that were dark blue on white become light blue on black.
Try it and save your eyesight!
