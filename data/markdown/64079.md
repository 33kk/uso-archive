### Description
The whole page is cluttered with unnecessary stuff, and the actual content is just around 50% of the usable space.
Optimised, and removed stuff.

### Update notes
Removed the unnecessary sidebar and footer, the content (with the single pictures) gets autoadjusted - so you can really utilize a widescreen, but also works on small browser windows.
The page-navigator is on the left side, so you always can access the next/previous page.
The borders around the pictures are removed (they look weird imo). 
If using Firefox, you can see when you are hovering an image (css3 animation).
Background black, and the primary color of the page can be chosen (default is green #00BB00)

Just the necessary stuff: the images, the title, (small) logo, and page navigator
Fixed the animation on hovering the thumbnails - replaced by a simple transition on click
search for 
border-radius: 50px !important;
and remove it if you do not want to use it.

dec 2013: Aligned Heading (Title) to the Prev/Next Buttons
