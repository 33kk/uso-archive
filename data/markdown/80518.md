### Description
Decorate the "new post" icons with Christmas lights. Ho ho ho!
(And, Style 80517)

### Update notes
<s>Only Firefox will blink the lights - Chrome won't animate <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html">generated content</a> like :before and :after.</s>
Lights will blink in Chrome now, too. (Yay!)

<s>... Well, the "new post" icons now blink on and off with the green bulbs, but I'll leave that for now.</s>
Hurrah! We have enough bulbs again, thanks to Tumblr's updates.

It would be nice to have more patterns, though.


Decorate the avatars, too, with Style 80517
And Userstyles.org with style 80531
