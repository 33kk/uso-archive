### Description
This is a small modified version of the great script:
http://userstyles.org/styles/45502/all-glass-mod-favicon-mod-tabs-width By northernbear

I've also changed the Tabs and implemented Glass Fox Dimmer for a white Underglow Effect

I've searched a long time for proper glass toolbars in this way and edited a few parts to get a better look with Stratiform 1.1

No extra code is included. I just combined code and deleted unnecessary code for my purpose.
So may someone find it helpful. Enjoy.
