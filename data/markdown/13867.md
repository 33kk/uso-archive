### Description
RIGHT

This is now a merged effort between myself and user 18807

We have removed a good portion of the surroundings from the chat window, as well as simplified that itself. The chat window no longer shows avatars, but you can see them by hovering over the user's name in the user list. 

In addition the text size has been shrunk. 

This is for a small window version, a link to a link of which will be coming soon. 

Any questions, comments, just add them with the link.
