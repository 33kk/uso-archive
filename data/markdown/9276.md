### Description
The title says it all: if you have not clicked on a tab yet, its title will come up in italics.

Tested on Firefox 3, Mac OS 10.5.4.

Credits:
Inspired by style 8247 by user 4639 
It did not quite work on FF3 on Mac OS 10.5.4, so I took a look at style 5319 by user 6147

Disclaimer: 
After some fiddling I stumbled across a winning combination. 
No, I do not know why it works - you tell me if you figure it out ;-)
