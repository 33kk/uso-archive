### Description
**** THIS THEME NO LONGER WORKS PROPERLY! THE CHANGE TO PHPBB V.3 HAS ADDED NEW ELEMENTS. I WILL UPDATE THIS AS SOON AS I CAN LOCATE A V.3 TEMPLATE****

heavily modified but based on the BenHeck smart blue by Darksavant0

an appealing blue/light blue forum theme with green elements, and a dark green background. also features red accents

*note the red links make reading certain parts of the main site a pain, you can mouse over and the links will turn blue but if you don't want to deal with it then choose my other theme. this one looks great on the forum, so if you rarely visit the rest of maximumpc.com then this might be for you
