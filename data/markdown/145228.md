### Description
Despite being intended for comprehension by human readers, the default style of Wikipedia lets text spill out to fill the entire width of a browser window, no matter how wide. This style pulls in the main article text to be just 45em wide, approximating the ideal column width for human readers used by typesetting experts such as those who created Latex. It does nothing except narrow the components of the main article text for comprehensibility, allowing it to be mixed freely with other ones which change the colour scheme and so on.
