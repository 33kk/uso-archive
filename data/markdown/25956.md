### Description
Created by Justin B
Created on 3/6/10

*Update 3/6/10*
I went ahead and just made the 'secret admire' redesign, you can install it at: http://userstyles.org/styles/25957

This style changes the entire matchmaker design to a darker, easier to look at design, since most people on the site spend most of their time on the matchmaker.
This is version 1.

Future updates:
Re color action icons, they will look better with the black background.
New 'Yes' & 'No' buttons.
Black background on the filters, with white text.

Upcoming redesigns:
The secret admire pages of the matchmaker, to match current color scheme.
My Matches redesign.
People I admire redesign.
