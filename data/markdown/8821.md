### Description
Gives you Transparency on all Tooltips (Global style).
** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **

* Thanks to for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 4120

You can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)

This makes your tooltips look really cool.
This style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.

Applies to:
+ Navigation Toolbar (Hover over button)
+ Hovering on a tab (tooltip will have radius)
+ Also Applies to EVERY single item on any web page (Hover over a link)

Additional Information:
+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.
Feel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!
* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.
