### Description
Just a quick dark theme for BerryTube.

Originally mocked up some changes while watching a movie so I could have chat on my second screen, without burning my eyes out. Cleaned up the code and set the colours to more appealing ones, then saved it to reuse later. Figured I'd share.

Perfectly usable wherever, but recommended for use in chat-only mode, as the inbox button likes to float away. If you're ever having trouble finding it, it will always render in its original horizontal position, but below any open inbox messages you have, possibly out the bottom of your screen (just empty some of your inbox to have it move up, into view).
