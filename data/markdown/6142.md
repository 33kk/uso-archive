### Description
Changed all fonts to sans-serif font families, because serif fonts are hideous. :|

update:

- aligned menus to the right, and made layout a fixed width.
- members page is very broken
- calendar page is very broken
- other bugs here and there

I hate whoever wrote the html for yahoo groups :)
