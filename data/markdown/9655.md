### Description
What 'Zap Colors' will do is zap backgrounds, and font color to something easier to read. White background, Black text.

This works great for themes that use dark backgrounds, or just plain unreadable colors e.g. (red text with a blue background). 

Inspired by the bookmarklet 'Zap Colors' by Jesse Ruderman (http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/zap.html), This is basically the same thing, only consistent on page refreshes.

Unless you're a vampire you'll probably will find this handy. 

2008-Aug-13:
added an img background (ensures some images won't be hidden with the background color change)
