### Description
This is a significant modification of the style as written by Sylenth Hikikomori ( https://userstyles.org/styles/146986/facebook-kimi-no-na-wa ). It is not the best of a modification but its what I wanted. It is also my first upload to here.

Significant changes include a red notification box for the top bar, different color schemes, more transparency, and some modifications I felt make viewing a bit easier.

Update V1.1 (2018/05/03) - Some minor modifications for visibility and readability.
