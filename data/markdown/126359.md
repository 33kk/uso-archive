### Description
Makes scrollbars and default drop-down menu arrows really thin and looking nice. This is the style for those who needs scrollbars only for indication of current position. Modify it as you want. Thumb color can be changed.

### Update notes
On screenshot, if you watch really closely, there is a thin bar. And it IS a scrollbar.
