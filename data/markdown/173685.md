### Description
Better Dark Mode with slight UI improvements and backgrounds. As this is an alpha version, it currently only works with 'Dim' mode. Default mode is broken and Lights Out mode seems a bit off. I'll keep working on the style.

### Update notes
<b>Version 0.1.2</b>

- Fixed 'Show more' button on 'Who to follow' not showing.
- Improved the '[user] Retwetted' box.
- Added some more transparencies, as a matter of testing currently.

<b>Version 0.1.1</b>

- Added a dark sidebar mathcing the style.
- Some tweaking done to the left sidebar, should look slightly better.

Next goal is to fix Default and Lights out modes and further improve the style overall.
