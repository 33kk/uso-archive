### Description
This style is abandon due to the old interface can not be used anymore (since Spotify redesigned their UI in April 2017). Please consider my style for the new interface here: <b><mark> <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/148065/spotify-spot-on">Spotify - spot on! </a></mark></b> *************
   
<b>Spotify - spot on!</b> is a theme with options like;
- choose a wallpaper
- choose your own colors on text and icons, just pick from the color chart or type the specific hex-color numbers 
- the scrollbar is thinner and only the thumb is visible, or completely hidden if I want that also
- possibility to insert an own image on someone you like (a girlfriend, your dog, ...). Portrait-format in your cell phone is just fine, focus can also be adjusted to left or right if neccessary.
- ad free
- etc

### Update notes
<b><mark>Workaround for Spotify's new UI (as of April 2017):</mark></b> 
To revert to previous UI just follow this <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux-Windows-Web-Player/New-Spotify-Web-Player-Design-NEW-2017-DESIGN-FEEDBACK-IDEAS/m-p/1641377#M184605">guide for Firefox and Chrome</a>

A very useful addon to pick your favorite colors is <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/firefox/">ColorZilla</a>. Just pick on a color at any web site and ColorZilla will return the exact hex-number.
Inside, at the beginning, of the script you will also find some other color combinations I like.

If you change any scrollbar-settings, please (log out from Spotify and) restart your browser for full effect. This is just a one-time-only-story of course.
Dont miss my own scrollbar-style,  <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/60328/glassfox-the-multi-style-scrollbar">GlassFox - the multi style scrollbar</a> works prefect together with this style.
