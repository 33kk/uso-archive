### Description
Yet another "dark google" style.

Changes Google search pages to use a black background and contrasting text.  Also replaces standard images with ghost-colored (darkish green) versions, to better fit the color scheme.

Fully affects standard Google search and Google image search.

Strongly affects Google news and Google product searches (some images may still have white backgrounds, etc)

Does not affect Google maps or GMail.

Untested on searches from the "more" dropdown.

Feedback is most welcome.  Let me know what you want included, what doesn't fit, what's broken.
