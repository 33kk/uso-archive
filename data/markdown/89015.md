### Description
Google+'s new layout causes smaller screen widths to look terrible because it always reserves space for the Hangouts bar, which cuts off the leftmost main content column.

This fixes that by no longer reserving any room for the bar.

The problem seems to only occur in Chrome, and does not effect Firefox users. Doesn't hurt anything in FF if installed though.
