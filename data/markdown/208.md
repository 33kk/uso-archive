### Description
I wrote a user-style to clean-up Google for my needs. I'm not sure if this will work on every system-configuration, because I'm using different 'google'-extensions with my firefox. Sure is that the main-page (google.com, .de a.s.o) will stay blank, that is because google is not well-formed. (actually I don't need the google main-page) Maybe other users could help to improve this userstyle. Please leave comment (discribe how the site renders on your system). Thx
