### Description
Here is a blue vista style FX3 that does not use background images from hosted sites, but rather the latest nightly native code. It looks great with glasser extension which can be found here http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=632112

I also suggest downloading this stylish http://userstyles.org/styles/6588 so that the menu bar gets glass as well :)

This is a sister theme to my previous one here http://userstyles.org/styles/7056

Please vote and comment, I am very new to this!

*** Update, now the findbar is themed.
