### Description
Colorize action buttons to indicate status of orders (ordered, payed, shipped, received, feedback).

Notes:

* Each state can be identified by at least one button, which only exists in this state and this is the button to be colorized
So, the tracking button isn't colorized, because it is shown in two different states.

* the header or filter buttons (categories) are colorized in the same color

* if one category is clicked only this becomes active, which is indicated by a dotted white border (which looks like a zigzag border)

* empty categories (those with count zero) are left uncolored

* the count is emphasized by a bold font and with a bit space around it

When I go to aliexpress.de I always end at an aliexpress.com domain and this is the only one configured.
May be you need to add a domain (*.de) like this:

@-moz-document domain("aliexpress.com"), domain("aliexpress.de")

If you need this, tell me, so I can add it to the userstyle.
