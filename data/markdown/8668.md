### Description
This Style is made to be used with the Firefox Extension Fast Dial Ver 1.90 at: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5721

What this Style allows you to do is to modify the roundness of the corners of the border of your Fast Dial cells.
(see pictures below)

To see further advantages of this facility please visit:
For users of Firefox 3:                      http://userlogos.org/node/1101
For users of Firefox 2:                      http://userlogos.org/node/1023

By altering the value of the -moz-border-radius: value (at present set to 25px in the code),  and by then saving the file, you will be able to make the corners of all your cells as round as you wish when using Fast Dial. 

Good demo of how this works here:

The original idea for this was put forward by Lain_13 on the Russian Fast Dial Forum see:
