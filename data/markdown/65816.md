### Description
Basically, I made **most of** the StackOverflow.com CSS styles wider by 640px from default.
I could possibly make it wider for a 2560x1440 resolution, but I felt this is wide enough so I don't need to move my eyes as much.

Please let me know what doesn't work because I made this up under 5 minutes.
