### Description
This is a VERY slight modification of the 4chan dark minimal theme.  All I did was tweak some colors so that they would match the current Jolicloud site.  It looks a bit prettier, in my opinion, so I thought I'd share.

You can probably tell that I don't know how to code, so if anyone wants to do the buttons, or has any other ideas, feel free to post.
