### Description
I like to drag the bookmark toolbar up on the main menu toolbar. Once there, it needs to be a little more visible.

Updated for Firefox 3, where it seems "bookmarks-ptf" is now now named "bookmarksBarContent". Thanks to Eric Wendelin (http://eriwen.com/) for figuring this out. I also changed the background colour.
