### Description
1 NOV 2017 - this is abandoned in light of webextensions basically neutering Stylish. 57+-compatible userChrome.css version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7a1xsl/bookmarks_in_toolbar/

Stylizes bookmarks to look like toolbar buttons so they can cleanly fit in the navigation toolbar.

Has options to match Windows Aero (7/Vista), Win8, Linux, OSX, Dev Edition Dark/Light, DeepDark and SimpleWhite. Also has an option that tries to match Firefox's theme outright, using the global CSS variables.
The themes change the appearance of the buttons when hovered/clicked, ideally to fit in. The icons use the Toolbar.png (chrome://browser/skin/Toolbar.png) built into Firefox and should always match (except for probably hi-DPI).

Has options to override bookmark favicons and use custom-defined icons (see details). They invert if necessary for personas, dark themes etc.
JS applets/bookmarklets default to a gear icon, RSS feeds default to an RSS icon.

### Update notes
Unfortunately, all margin/padding values have to be hard-coded for each separate theme. If you're using Classic Theme Restorer's small icons mode (or something similar), feel free to modify until they fit in properly.


This is a highly ambitious userstyle and is likely to be broken somehow and/or break in the future due to firefox changes.
If something isn't working properly, please <i>let me know</i> so I can look into fixing it.


<b>Custom icons</b> - (will most likely not work properly if favicon override is disabled) add any one of the following to the toolbar-level bookmark name to have it display:

page-icon (default for websites)
gear-icon (default for JS applets)
rss-icon (default for livemarks)
search-icon
video-icon
mail-icon
wrench-icon
