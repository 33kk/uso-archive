### Description
2007.Oct.14 Sun, 16:34 --700 (PDT) >> THIS STYLE IS NOW COMPLETE AND SEPARATE FROM GOOGLEVERSE DARKEXPANSE

Originally, this style was meant to be used in conjunction with my GoogleWiki DarkExpanse. But because of increasing trouble in attempting to manage both as a single style, I have now separated them. This should make all future adjustments much easier than they have been before. Hopefully, the result will be a more beautiful rendering of each style in it's own right.

This will also give a nicer icon for WikiPedia!
