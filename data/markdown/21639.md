### Description
This is still a BETA, basically used to go between work and home. Tweak of "Google Web Search - Dark Gray Theme (vC)" by Valacar (Found here: http://userstyles.org/styles/1693). I am also trying to tweak it to work with Google Images, not as easy as I first thought...


v2.0 (5/11/10) - Updated to work with Google's May2010 layout (lost all my work, this was a quick one)
v1.0 (2/02/10) - most bugs worked out, soon to have embedded images!
b0.6 (1/13/10) - Hidden until active fix, minor black text fixes.
b0.5 (12/03/9) - Should fix all notices (awareness days etc.) on front page
b0.4 (11/16/9) - fixed the image borders, adjusted web results width, minor color tweaks
b0.3 (10/23/9) - Alignment adjustments, black text now green, removed base 64 for now, will put them back when I reduce code
b0.2 (10/15/9) - Made my own logos, some color tweaks
b0.1 (10/08/9) - Added what I have so far...
