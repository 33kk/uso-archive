### Description
Style changes to Reddit to make it more pleasant to read, especially for large comment threads:

* change the default font to [Merriweather Sans]() and increase text size across the site
* change standard links to sky blue and visited links to orange for visibility and ease of seeing already visited posts/article links/links in comments
* make tagline underneath comment text smaller but easier to find
* hide CSS popups on up/down vote arrows
* make comment editor box less cramped, use the same font as comments.

RES-related:

* live preview uses the same font as editor and comments, better aligned with the editor
* shrink text in short-cut bar to allow more links
