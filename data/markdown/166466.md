### Description
A personalized Google homepage made into a nice and cute Kirby theme! Some of the letters are hard to see due to the color, but if you edit the theme you're allowed to change the background into something you'd like best. Enjoy ^^

### Update notes
The background is animated AND it adds a little Kirby-shaped cursor! (made by Segab on https://www.deviantart.com/segab/art/Kirby-cursors-95258823 )

Originally a regular code for a custom background by xdnyan ( https://userstyles.org/users/169276 ), I began changing some of the colors and logos and I ended up with an entirely different homepage (using elements from DarkSearch by Nass O! https://userstyles.org/styles/118959/darksearch-for-google ). 
I did not ask to use the code for this style, so if the original users ask me to take this down I'll have no choice but to do so.
