### Description
So you got deviantPLUS and it does a great job of giving you easy access to all the formatting features you can use on dA.
However, there is a slight problem in the fact that the dP toolbar pushes the textarea down, making it become unflush to the mood box.
What to do. Well, this little snippet is intended to, basically, reduce the height of the textarea with the added bonus of removing the black border in dP toolbar.
