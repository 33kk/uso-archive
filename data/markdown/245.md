### Description
Darn website snipping the title. Should be "Stylish - Use prettier enabled/disabled icons in the Manage Styles window", since that's more explanatory.

2007-09-18: Fixed it not working in recent versions of Stylish. Sorry about not maintaining my styles for so long. I'd been using Opera for the past few months, but I just switched back to Firefox, so I should be doing a better job from here on out. (I guess I should update the screenshots too, and also see about replacing the checkmark icon in the bar at the top.)
