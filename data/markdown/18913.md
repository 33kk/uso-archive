### Description
Install this stylesheet (you need either the Stylish or Greasemonky plugin for Firefox, or Opera web browser) to get a more compact layout of song lists at thesixtyone.com. It breaks layout of the artist pages a little. If you find that annoying, just temporarily disable the style.

In case you're looking at a screen that's bigger than 1024 x 768, there's a version available with slightly bigger typeface and a little more space between list items: http://userstyles.org/styles/18907

Btw. I'm Evonity @ The Sixtyone. If you use this style and you like it, than come over to my wall and say hello (http://www.thesixtryone.com/evonity/)
