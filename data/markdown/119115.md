### Description
Plex Web is a responsive app designed to work on any viewport. However, some parts of the UI are a bit awkward at narrower viewports.

In particular, the music control bar (aka the mini player) is not very responsive, and breaks if your viewport is 1014px wide or less. This stylesheet tweaks the mini player so that it can support much narrow viewports (it will ultimately still break at 658px or lower).

Additionally, tweaks have been made to the details view page (i.e. for an album, movie, or TV show) and to the sidebar that make them adapt slightly better to smaller viewports.
