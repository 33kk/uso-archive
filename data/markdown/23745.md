### Description
Article *Only* View:  EFF.org, Newsweek, etc.

Basically, this aims to make clicking on links from aggregation sites (Digg.com, Google News, etc.) lead to a clean version of the actual article content without all the garish advertising and lousy web design.

If you actually use these sites, you may need to disable this style to get around them.  :-P
