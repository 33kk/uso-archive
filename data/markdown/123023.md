### Description
if one is familiar with the usage of keyboard shortcuts or viewing the lists is sufficient, this one should fit. Only search field is visible from navigation and tooling bar.


Important: switch off Stylish for getting into settings etc..

UPDATE 4/2017:
* removed lots of css code, for minimal footprint
* Description field is only editable with 'e' key. That is a workaround for unclear scroll handling of existing website.
