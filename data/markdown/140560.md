### Description
Version: 1.0.4

Changed the colors to something more Modern and Dark. Most colors are based off of Bootstrap's default color scheme #292b2c and #EEE.

Also centered the content pages for example on Userpage, it is now centered instead of all the way to the left. This works for every page I've tested thus far.

Applied the Viewport extension to this theme as well, the Viewport is 900px wide. Easily adjustable in the CSS file if needed.
