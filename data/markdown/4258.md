### Description
This style was written for the Primus Bull Board, found at http://www.primusville.com/bullboard/ and http://www.prawnsong.com/bullboard/. It makes the board wider (1000px) so there is more horizontal space, increasing the number of words per page at high resolutions and for widescreens. It also uses a pseudo-inverted color scheme that can be easier on the eyes than the original Aria (white/blue) color scheme. Finally, inline links are colored differently than surrounding text so as to stand out better.

Please Note: a few items (for example, the log-in button) have not been styled. This is because I never see them and, on the rare occasion I do, was never motivated to put forth such effort. If there is something I missed that renders the style too difficult to use, contact me on the board, and I will do what I can to fix the problem.
