### Description
This is a simple style sheet that aims to do the following:

* Change highlight color of searched terms
* Change hyperlink colors in posts 
* Reduce empty whitespace between the end of your post and your signature.
This empty space is created by the kickstarter badge for those who have it.
* Pin thread navigation, and User/Thread Controls on the top of your browser frame. 
These will not move when you scroll.
* Resizes large images in the poster's signature. If the signature is still large a scroll bar will be automatically added to keep the poster's signature into a manageable size.

** Note: This style sheet is NOT intended for mobile devices.
