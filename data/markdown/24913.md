### Description
Requires UrlbarExt extension for Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/8758

This style is a replacement for icons in the urlbar area for both the UrlbarExt extension (copy, tiny, search, up, tags, sequence, proxy) and browser's standard (go, bookmark, rss feed, search).

Modification includes:
- extra spacing to "Add bookmark" icon making it more significant, separated from other icons (Firefox)
- grippy exactly the same as FF's grippies, was different (UrlbarExt)
- small shape/color mod of the "special" tooltip (UrlbarExt)

With the release of Firefox 3.6, version 1.6 of UrlbarExt became incompatible with the browser. There's a workaround however, untill the author updates. While on extension's page, browse user reviews and look for comment by jonwww on a version with simple hack removing compatibility issues. Works.
