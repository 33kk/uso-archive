### Description
This userstyle tweaks a few elements in FurAffinity's beta preview.
Some of the changes include:
 - Added soft shadow gradient to site banner image, so that the white text used for the links is more readable.
 - tweaked radius of rounded edges on images/profile elements, as well as on text fields.
 - added orange colors to certain text to add emphasis (this orange matches the current orange color found in the logo and website)
 - made max size of footer smaller to match current amount of text there.
