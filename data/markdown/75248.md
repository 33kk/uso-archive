### Description
UPDATE NOV 7, 2014
MS changed some IDs to classes. Changing style to compensate. Mostly affected the compose screen's awful "your screen is a tablet" side-by-side waste of space. Putting TO, FROM, SUBJECT back on top, where it belongs.

UPDATED MAY 17, 2013
The new Outlook.com is awful on a monitor. Large, blocks of UI that have way too much padding and are positioned at the wrong spots.  This is version 1 of trying to fix it, starting with the Compose screen. The "from/to/subject" are takes up half the screen, and is in the wrong place. Reduced font size, removed blockiness, put it back on top.
