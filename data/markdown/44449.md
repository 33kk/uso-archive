### Description
Based a lot on The Aeroboy Chrome extension (http://goo.gl/1fBKP), these scrollbars are a slight refinement. Choose between his and mine, I'm not sure how much better or worse mine are! WEBKIT BROWSERS ONLY (Chromium, Safari, ect. - NOT Firefox).

NEW - Mozilla version: style 46044.

Differences to Aeroboy's extension:
 - Transparency on all scrollbars except the far outer ones.
 - Change of colour on hover and mouse down.
 - Thinner.
 - Possible other things I have forgotten.

Screenshot notes:
 - Them two scrollbars in "after" really are the same colour, it's an optical illusion! Even I (who wrote the code) had to check this in Paint.
 - The scrollbar in "before" is from an XP theme I have downloaded (i.e. the system default).
 - The screenshots are from this page (the edit page), with style 44215 activated.
