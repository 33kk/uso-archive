### Description
Mostly, the left sidebar has fewer elements and icons. Started from Lee Fuhr's <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/143591/asana-simplified-and-with-more-hierarchy">Asana â€¢ simplified and with more hierarchy</a> (v6) and removed most of his mods to fonts, headers and the Inbox, while keeping his mods to fade the Task "ministories" until you hover over them.
