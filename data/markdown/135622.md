### Description
Dark theme for National Weather Service local forecast page (forecast.weather.gov). So far this works only on the new NWS page format.

Does not work on *.noaa.gov pages (including translated pages like the old format Spanish page, for example).

Does not evenly shade headers of pages linked from the forecast.weather.gov local forecast page due to the way some of the header images are implemented, and tends not to work on other *.weather.gov pages.

All of these are surmountable problems. I just don't feel that motivated.
