### Description
This is a recoloring of the Fimfiction 'user toolbar'.  The background is a reverse of the subtle grey gradient the top bar uses, the normal button color is a gradient from the hint of pink in Celestia's coat to pure white, and the hovered-over button color is S1 Luna's coat color, to pure white.

...because, seriously knighty?  Olive green?
