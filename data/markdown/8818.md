### Description
Gives you Transparency on all menus, poups and toolbar drop-downs.
** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **

* Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771

You can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)

This makes your menus look really cool.
This style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.

Applies to:
+ File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus
+ Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)
+ Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)
+ Right-Clicking on a tab (rounds the menus)
+ Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)
+ Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane



Additional Information:
+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.
Feel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!
* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.
