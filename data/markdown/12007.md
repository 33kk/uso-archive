### Description
Screenshot: http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f60/bededog/ot_screenshot.jpg

This is a simple theme with the purpose of replicating the look and feel of the 'Ice' theme on Gamespot. After the latest site redesign they no longer support the theme and have gone on record that they will not make an updated version. 

By default this theme edits the look of the entire site(minus unions atm). If you wish to only change the look of the forums you can edit the code. Replace the line:
@-moz-document domain("gamespot.com")
with: 
@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.gamespot.com/pages/forums/)

The theme isn't perfect but it does a decent job. I hope you enjoy it. 
*Note: This theme is best used with the GS dark(default) theme enabled. It works with the light theme but doesn't look as good and has some mismatched coloring.

Thanks for the help from the_foreign_guy and jakeboundville. =3
