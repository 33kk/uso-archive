### Description
Yep, made myself a theme that just changes all the fonts to Comic Sans. Memes-aside, it's a pretty useful font for dyslexics, and I know that Comic Sans can help people just write faster in general. Comes in OG Cherubplay colors for now, but I'll most likely make one for the default Cherp colors as well! Will most likely not do this for the other styles, though.
