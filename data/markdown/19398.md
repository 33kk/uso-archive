### Description
This is a style that makes the Gawker sites dark in color. 

The style is still a work in progress, but it works well enough for now.

[Update March 20]

Finally got around to fixing Gallery posts. I also changed some things on the tag pages. You can easily change the size of comments now, just change the pixel value of #comments. I set it to 800px instead of 600px as well. Some other changes as well.
