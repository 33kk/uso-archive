### Description
Ever had a nice picture you wanted to use as background on tumblr but couldn't figure out how?
Ever wanted to have that one precious character always with you while you're tumbling?

Here you go, with this theme you just gotta set your preferences, provide your links and bam, you can slap your husbando or waifu on your dashboard... or just a simple wallpaper you really enjoy.

PS: friendly advice - better use links than uploading your pictures, it works faster. If you upload your own, hit the green button and wait for it to turn blue, it might take a while if the images are big. It's quicker to put them online somewhere and use links.

### Update notes
●UPDATES●
22 Jan 2015 ∙ Counters have same color of sidebar text. / Added option to choose background color when hovering over sidebar sections.
10 Jan 2015 ∙ Modifiable "back to top" arrow color / Removed blue bg when hovering on sidebar text / Removed blue strip behind scrolling avatars (happens in updated Firefox) / Removed blue bg from "recommended for you" bar on search page + make it scroll or not / Replaced blue bg with transparent white bg when composing new post after clicking the compose button.

1 Dec 2014 ∙ Modifiable color of the sidebar text / Radar & recommended blogs: show or not.

30 Nov 2014 ∙ Fixed "new post" text box, Firefox users won't see the background invading the box.

▶Just a few explanations before you start:

1▸ If you choose a pattern for the background, please use only big/wallpaper sized images. As you can see from the third option, I let you choose if the image should be repeated or not, but if you choose a small one (and therefore set it on "repeat"), you need to open the code itself (click on the userstyles app on your browser > edit) and at this line:

background-size: [png size you've chosen], cover !important;

change COVER into AUTO, remember to hit save, and it should look right.

To make things easier just choose a wallpaper sized image/pattern and you won't have to do anything.

2▸ You don't have to add a transparent character, if you just want to change the color, or the background image, you can just write "transparent" where the url should go. Don't worry I've left instructions, it's easy. ^^

3▸ GIFs work too! That's right, try out a transparent gif as foreground image (you can find many on tumblr) it's quite entertaining!

4▸ One of the options lets you choose the size of the PNG, some are already small enough in their original size but I've left other options in case you're using a big image. If those are not working for you, open the code (again, userstyles app on your browser > edit) and at that same line:

background-size: Npx, cover !important;

change whatever value you've set for N into something that might work better for you, like 350px or 250px. (Remember to hit save!)

5▸ Last thing I promise! Once you've installed the dashboard you might want to change something, like the color of the background or the size of your PNG, in that case you just need to refresh this page, change the settings and hit on "update".
