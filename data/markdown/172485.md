### Description
This script allows the images used for reactions on the Smogon forums (like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry) to be changed. By default the original XenForo reacts will be used, but this can be changed to any images the user desires. Note that the same image can be used for multiple reacts and that different file formats (including gifs!) can be used. Coloured text for reactions will be removed by default, but the colour of text for each reaction can also be invidividually changed.

To change the image for a react, edit the line of the relevant area of code of the form "background: url(https://i.imgur.com/VjOCJVJ.png) 0px 0px no-repeat !important;" to have the URL of the desired image.

To change the colour of text for a react, go to the relevant part of the code and find the line starting with "colour:" ("color: inherit;" by default). Enter a hexcode, e.g. #1371a9, so that the line is of the form "color: #1371a9;".

For any problems, contact Yoda2798 on Smogon or Showdown.
