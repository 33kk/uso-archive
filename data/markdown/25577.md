### Description
I whipped this up quickly after not finding any other styles that gave the results I wanted. This theme was made for the Elementary theme for Firefox on Ubuntu. I cannot guarantee results on other operating systems or with other themes. In fact, I'm fairly certain it'd look horrible with any other themes. :P

It was inspired by style 13511 by user 14809. I admit that I referenced his code in order to figure out what everything did, as this is the first style I've ever made. I kept the code simple as I don't think I could do much else. If I can figure it out, I'll try to get some subtle gradients in the tabs later, and maybe tweak the borders a bit. Feel free to leave suggestions and tips!

//UPDATES
- Added highlight on mouse-over to unselected tabs
- Gave active tab a gradient

//MORE UPDATES
- Tab strip and inactive tabs now have gradient backgrounds. Probably won't update it any more beyond this unless the Elementary theme changes significantly.

//YET MORE UPDATES
A user on the Elementary Project forums created a modified version of this theme for the Tabs-on-Top extension for Firefox. It's really nice and I recommend checking it out! http://www.elementary-project.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=177#p177
