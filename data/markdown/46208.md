### Description
This is an attempt to fix the icon for the Read It Later extension in Firefox 4 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/read-it-later/).

The RIL (Read it Later) icon in FF4 is ugly. I have attempted to make it smaller. Its an ugly hack till RIL fixes it themselves. The problem, I believe, comes from the unread count (though I am far from certain this is the problem). This is broken in FF4, yet there is space. So, disable unread count in the extension, and install this mod.
