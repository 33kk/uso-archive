### Description
After being inspired by the thread <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/the-mad-admin.538541">"The Mad Admin."</a>, I decided to create a CSS theme that allows you to set your own GBAtemp.net background.
This style only works with tempStyle 2 Dark. Please use tempStyle 2 Dark at all times when using this style.

### Update notes
This is the first release, and it is in a BETA state. Some things may not be tested, and some things may not be completely skinned.
Please report issues to me on GBAtemp (sks316) or on Discord (sks316#2523).
