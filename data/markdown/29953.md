### Description
The friends menu didn't really fit in with v7, so I darkened it and matched the color scheme with the rest of the colors in the top bar. Obviously there are some limitations and it's not a perfect fit, but I hope that it looks at least slightly more cohesive with the rest of the site.

If there are any errors, please leave a comment. I don't use deviantART often anymore, so bugs may go unnoticed for a while without a heads up. :)
