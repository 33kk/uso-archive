### Description
This style is compilation of two other styles (by user 60):
          1. style 547
          2. style 513

This style also includes suggestions made by users in discussions of those styles.

I made vertical alignment of items and as a result missing icons appeared again (Flexible Space and Space).
Long labels are now cropped.
