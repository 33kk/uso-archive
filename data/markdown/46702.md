### Description
All credit goes to the original authors.

I have streamlined many styles into one that works well with a widescreen monitor and a dark theme. Simply edit the text colours to suit your theme.

This style moves the account activity and usage to below the Sign Out link in the top right corner.

The style implements the following:
1. Hides Invites.
2. Hides Chat.
3. Hides Ads and relocates actions.
4. Hides the Buzz Icon.
5. Hides each component in the footer separately.
6. Includes the code if you want to switch off quick links.
7. Includes the code if you want to switch off the entire footer at once.
8. Moves the % usage and account activity below Sign Out.
9. Adds row highlights.
