### Description
For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This style was resurrected, since user 169 deleted style 36762. I restored style to the "Check for updates" button in AOM 'Available Updates' category and restored "[Ext]Add-on Manager Hilite"(AMH) compatibility and updated "[Ext]Is it Compatible?" style compatibility and also added "[Ext]Scriptify" and "[Ext]Extension List Dumper" style compatibility, and also gave "[Ext]TabGroups Menu" an styled add-on icon in AOM add-on list view, and hide AOM "Get Add-ons" category and the AOM scroll-bar which can be restored under the style code section:

/* =========== hide stuff =========== */

Tested on Firefox 4 and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

To customize or fix Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds, you can also have a look at my other styles: user 61655
