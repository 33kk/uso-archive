### Description
This script will cleanup the new yahoo mail interface.

* Hides the ad on empty folders
* Hides the ad on the welcome page
* Collapses the adbar so there is more room for content.

This works better than the current greasemonkey solutions because yahoo added scripts to check if people try to kill ads with js. So most js solutions no longer works..
