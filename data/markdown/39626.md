### Description
First time posting a style.

I adapted this from some existing styles for use with Gmail's Phantasea theme. I prefer all hovered mail to look the same whether it's old, new, or checked, but you can change the colors as you like. Height of the top color in unread and checked mail can be changed as well.

Unread mail is light blue to dark blue (top to bottom)

Selected mail is light green to dark green (top to bottom)

Hovered mail (both read, unread, and checked) is gray on top and bottom, white in middle.

Read mail has white background.

Styles running include http://userstyles.org/styles/22248 which takes bold away from new mail, and tweaks font colors in message area to black for sender and subject, gray for body of e-mail.
