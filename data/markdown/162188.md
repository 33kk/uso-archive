### Description
I liked the UIkit 2 components and style and so tried to gave that tinge to our Stylish extension. This is for Google Chrome however you can edit to make it work in Firefox if you like by changing the URL.

Important:
	- Ensure to remove the comments for @import rules to import external fonts.
