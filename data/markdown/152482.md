### Description
Allows you to fully customize how the subtitles look on Hidive. Read the additional info for installation instructions and limits.

### Update notes
To customize your settings, click the "Advanced Style Settings" button. Here is what each option does (most should be self-explanatory):

<bold>Border Size:</bold> How many pixels thick to make the font border.

<bold>Border Color: What color to make the border. I recommend something dark since the subtitle primary color is white/yellow. 

<bold>Override Subtitle Font?:</bold> If enabled, overrides the subtitle font with whatever you input in "Custom Font".

<bold>Custom Font:</bold> The font to use if you enabled the above. Examples: "PT Sans", "Trebuchet MS", "Open Sans". You can use any font as long as you have it installed on your system.

<bold>Override Font Size:</bold> Override the font size (shocker). 

<bold>Custom Font Size:</bold> If the above option is enabled, it will use this value.

<bold>Override Font Weight:</bold> Force a specific font weight. Options are bold or normal.

<bold>LIMITS/WARNINGS</bold>

The way Hidive's subs work is each line in the script has its own CSS. By using this script, you are overwriting whatever custom settings they may have had. For example, let's say there is a sign that they used a cursive font for. If you overwrite the font, it will use that instead. Long story short, enabling overrides will probably break most typesetting (although the typesetting is bad anyway, so it's not much of a loss). 

The other "issue" is how the player renders the subs. When you override the border size and font size, it will set the font/border to that size for both the small, windowed player and the fullscreen player. Basically, the subs are set to a small size and then to a bigger size when you fullscreen the player. This script is limited to only changing both at the same time. If you make the subs extra big for full screen, they may be too big for the regular player. This is not really that big an issue considering you'll either be watching it in one or the other and not going between the two constantly.
