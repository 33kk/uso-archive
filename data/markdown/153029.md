### Description
A tweaked / updated version of the Dragon Pokémon Showdown Skin theme created by Liance. *A lot of things have been improved upon by me as the original was released in 2015*

*Added some tweaks from Pedro J. Miranda's theme as I really like the effects he added to the Default Pokémon Showdown*
