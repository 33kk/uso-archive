### Description
This style modifies the Gmail style included in this add-on (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=google+redesigned&cat=all). Please install this add-on before using my style. 

Here are some of the modifications I made to the original Gmail Redesigned style to suit my needs:

1.  Email list scrolls (thanks to http://userstyles.org/styles/7013)
2.  Removed Contacts button, Tasks button, and "Invite a friend" box,  since I don't use these.  
3.  Removed "Archive", "Labels", and "Move to" buttons from upper toolbar, since I don't use these. 
4.  Repositioned "Print all", "New window", "Expand/Collapse all", "Turn off/on highlighting" buttons. Removed "Forward all" button.
5.  Removed stars and labels, since I don't use these, and repositioned dates/times in email list
6.  You will notice other adjustments as well, but I've covered the important items that won't be displayed
