### Description
Implements a series of changes to the video-viewing pages (youtube.com/watch?v=#########) to make them look cleaner:
<ul><li>Removes various extraneous information, e.g. unrelated "Hot This Week" video suggestions, the new "Guide," the footer, and background images.</li>
<li>Removes the comments section, because let's be honest, YouTube comments are a pit of hell.</li>
<li>Makes the page take up pretty much the whole width of the window, and centers everything.</li>
<li>Shuffles the suggested videos list down below the video information, with three videos per row instead of just one.</li>
<li>Optionally changes the "Large player" mode to proportionally resize the video to your window size, instead of using a fixed 854x480 resolution.</li></ul>

### Update notes
Updated September 12th, 2013 to handle changes made in YouTube's HTML and CSS since the style was first posted.
