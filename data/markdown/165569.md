### Description
A set of CSS to make Microsoft Teams a little more like Slack, for those of us being force marched into the painful migration from the eye-friendly and space efficient Slack to the backlog-heavy vast emptiness of Teams

This version is based HEAVILY on the existing work mstmstyle did for his "Condensed Microsoft Teams for Light theme", in fact I flat out copied, pasted, and modified it.

mstmstyle says this is fine :)
This style was created to make up for the issue complained about here: https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/17408641-please-create-a-professional-compact-chat-layout

Please visit that link, vote it up, and hope MS fixes Teams :)
