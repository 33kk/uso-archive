### Description
Firefox 4 introduced hardware acceleration into the browser. On Windows Vista, 7, and 8, this acceleration uses DirectWrite for fonts if available, which is particularly sensitive to font weights. xkcd manually specifies numeric values such as "800" instead of relative values. GDI approximates the values, but DirectWrite produces fonts that are "too bold". This simple style does nothing more than change font-weights to their relative names to fix the display.
