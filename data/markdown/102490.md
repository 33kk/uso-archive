### Description
Inspired by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/283m59/with_the_gatherer_style_refresh_this_is_what_i/">this article</a>, I decided to see how close I could get to the proposed visual style without modifying any of Gatherer's HTML.  The changes are only applied to the "Standard" format of the output, and aren't guaranteed to display beautifully for every card.
