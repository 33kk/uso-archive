### Description
Just a simple style i made for site scrap.tf
Allows you to change background of it and adds a nice transparency to stuff

### Update notes
1.8
Fixed text boxes background also being changed
1.7
Few corrections to profile with new layout
1.6 and half
Highlight colours are now determined with rgba values instead of hex, sadly this forces me to use predetermined values in placeholder function.
1.6
added raffles transparency back AND added highlight to entered raffles, colour can be customised thanks to use of placeholder function (Thank you so much Jesse)
1.5
Removed transparency to raffles panel making recognising already joined raffles easier (i tried to do a highlight to those but couldn't do it)
1.4
Added transparency to stats on profile
1.3
Added use of place holder function making customising it easier.
1.2
Added darker background on main site welcome message to make it more readable
1.1
Changed background size settings so it will be always stretched to fit window size, instead of cutting off not fitting parts of image used
1.0
Initial release
