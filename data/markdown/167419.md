### Description
Do you like my style? Please support my work and fund me a coffee (via PayPal to the left of "Install" button). Also share style with your friends. Thank you for being awesome!

Darkest Fusion supports almost every Google site. Due to a style size limit Darkest Fusion has been divided into 2 parts. That one contains dark theme for most common used Google sites: 
<strong>About, Account management, Alerts, Books, Calendar, Contacts, Drive, Finance, Groups, Hangouts, Maps, My Activity, One, Patents, Payments, Passwords, Photos, Scholar, Search, Sheets, Tasks, Translate, Travel and Trends</strong>.

<strong><mark>Second style is available >>> <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/180430/google-darkest-fusion-2-2">there</a> <<<</mark></strong>

Keep and Support currently have stock dark themes.

Originally based on great work by DeathTBO who abandoned his project so I decided to continue his work by rebuilting everything from scratch. I hope you like my vision for Dark Google :)

### Update notes
If you find issue, describe it accurate please. Provide screen, tell me language/area and browser you are using because often it depends of them. <mark><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7IZvIma.png">See example</a></mark>. Please don't give thumbs down/OK in comments with small issues. I will fix them as soon as possible. Thank you.

Additional informations:
- on Chrome/Opera Homepage may not work correctly, <a href="https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/80475/"> solution there</a>
- Images in e-mails on Gmail have a bit different color, it's result of "workaround" to make most of e-mails dark themed (you should also enable official dark theme for Gmail)

Added support for dark messages for Gmail (not customizable yet due to an error with userstyles - I've contacted with support). A lot of thanks to @Idomo for his help and both @ㄢSmallaluz  and @Wolf68k for finding and reporting issues :)
