### Description
Read-only, more legible wikipedia.

NOTE: I use this style in conjunction with a keyword assignment to the wikipedia search box (so I can type 'wp searchqueryhere' into the address bar in Firefox) but I have also added the search box to the top right for convenience.  Also note that I have not accounted for all the template styles available in Wikipedia, but most articles seem fairly well formatted (forewarning).

Update 12/02/08 -- Made various text formatting enhancements, added rounded corners, added search box to the top right
Update 12/19/08 -- Fixed issue where long titles would overlap with the search box
Update 1/9/09 -- Fixed some overlap issues on homepage; called out blockquotes; improved list formatting
Update 1/17/09 -- Hid new ad banner at the top of the page
Update 4/21/09 -- Added 'edit this page' button to top right per request in the comments
Update 5/30/09 -- Added a 'sans serif' version of this style: http://userstyles.org/styles/18282
