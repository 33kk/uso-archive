### Description
An updated modification of <a href="/styles/118617/scp-wiki-night-mode">SCP Wiki Night Mode</a> to add additional edits to pages that like to mess with the format.

NOTE: Unfortunately there is an error with stylish that causes the regexp to be cut off in code 2 due to how lengthy it is, the only method I know of how to fix it is below.

1. Select the edit button above (assuming you installed it).

2. Scroll down to code 2 in the new window.

3. There should be an "applies to" section under the code, replace it with the notes from the latest update below: 

4. Press save. If you did everything correctly it should be functioning.
