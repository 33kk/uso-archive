### Description
Found some old screenshots of the old 'legacy' Twitter layout lying
around, and decided to make this imitation just for fun.
Its not exactly like the old one, but I've tried:)

The theme doesn't know your header image by default, so you have to link it
(click on your header and select 'copy image url').

Its a very fresh version still and there might be some
bugs/inconsistencies, if you found some send dm or tweet me 
at <a href="https://twitter.com/vitaminiser">@Vitaminiser</a>.

Enjoy!
