### Description
By default this style will be blocking hairstyles from exploration(victoria, lucia, naboo, effie, curtis, lara, lawrence, jackson, xianghua, makoto, hinoto), eldarya vairons(…that i don’t use), old common clothes - like patchworks or ruffled pants and things from other guards, that show normally with red background. By customizing you can easily hide whole sets, things you got from bindles but don’t like or hide all hairstyles except those in colors you use. Anything you don’t want but can’t sell, it all can be gone :D
