### Description
I made this code because I am an online student working on a course run on Apex Software. The header bugged me, so I made this.

This code removes the top header on Apex and moves the controls up to their proper place.

NOTE: WILL ONLY WORK ON APEXLEARNING.COM!!! DOES NOT WORK ON APEXVS.COM!!!
