### Description
For Firefox 14+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This styles the Urlbar Identity-box label to make it look more similar to the Identity-box appearance before the new Urlbar Identity block design for Firefox 6 landed due to Bug 634065.

Works well with "LeftSideStar" extension:
