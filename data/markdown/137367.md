### Description
Small stylesheet that unstickies the footer bar on Wikia. Does not remove it entirely, because it contains circumstantially useful links and tools, but does stick it to the bottom of the page instead of the viewport.

You may also wish to check out style 137367, style 137613, and style 162390, which I've tried to keep compatible. Combine them to make Wikia look how you want!
