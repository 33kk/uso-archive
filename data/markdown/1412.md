I have the other QJ Cleaner and I didn't like it. So in the end I decided to make one myself. It does many things, some stuff that people may not like, but hopefully someone finds it useful

Changes to the original:
-All main text (non headers) are Tahoma @ 9px
-Many frames gone, Content is all that remains

Things I plan on fixing/Things I couldn't figure out:
-I want to make this a liquid site... but I can't figure out the code to do it, If you look in my CSS you can clearly see where I tried but none of it worked.
-I couldn't get that bar at the very top to disappear...

Any help with those would be greatly appreciated, pop an email to n00b310@gmail.com

*Note that I use adblock, so theres already no ads on mine -- I've also blocked some random images on my after page*
