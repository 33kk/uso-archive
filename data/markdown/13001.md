### Description
Expanded on the other style...

Removes a bit more from the site but still remains looking like more then a blank page with text.

Header is hidden but can be shown by hovering the arrow in the top left corner, it's only 17px, so you won't be causing the header to pop all the time...

Changed font in question and answers....

Check it out and see what you think.. :-)
