### Description
TPB theme fully made by me. Inspired by Moko's theme (https://userstyles.org/styles/110548/pirate-bay) but I legitimately didn't use anything from it except the background color :)

Only tested in Chrome and on my computer. I'll not add or remove any detail for anyone because (I'm sorry if i'm being rude but...) I made this style for me. I uploaded it here so I won't lose it. Thanks for being comprehensive.

NOTE: I WROTE THAT WHILE USING AN ADBLOCKER. IF YOU DON'T USE ONE, IT WILL NOT LOOK THE SAME.
