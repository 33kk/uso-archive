### Description
Hides comments and all the recommended videos on the front page, and some more minor stuff.

This is for anyone who feels like every time they read a youtube comment they lose an IQ point, and whose recommended videos seem to be just a bunch of cut outs of adults infront of a super bright background making faces like children.

Also hides search button (press / to focus on the search bar and Enter to search, it's faster), video statistics and action buttons, all the buttons in the top right (Upload, G+ notifications and the profile button) and all the social media buttons on the Share Video screen.

I guarantee your quality of life will increase when you start using youtube strictly for viewing videos. Plus no one actually cares what you think of a video
