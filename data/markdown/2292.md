### Description
This style changes the Fark design to something more akin to the old skin while retaining some of the better parts of the new skin.  Essentially, it reverts the comments to the old style, removes the ads, takes away the rainbow of tabs, and moves the important links to the left rather than the right.  It also leaves some space on the right to give the main content a more centered feel.
