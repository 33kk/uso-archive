### Description
<p>A fork (custom version) of Reddit Slate Nights 2.0 by Tenderhooks (the #1 theme for Reddit on userstyles at the time - https://userstyles.org/styles/70271/reddit-slate-nights-2-0-dark). </p>

<p>I installed the original months ago and didn't like the colors or the size of the texts. I changed them and have been using it for months. I decided to upload my work since the original theme is no longer being updated and there was a recent Reddit update that left white spots in some areas. </p>
