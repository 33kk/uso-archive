### Description
***** To the Mac O.G., RIP! Thank You, Steve, for the changing the world and making it a better place! You will be forever loved and missed! Steve Jobs, 1955 - 2011 *****

*** Please be sure to "Like", "+1", etc. my style if you use it! ***

Completely rebuilt and now compatible with both Firefox 5 and Google Chrome!

Like the other, a simple Google home page style, done with OS X style. Simply choose from one of the thousands of Mac wallpapers on the net to set as your Google home page wallpaper and you're good to go.
