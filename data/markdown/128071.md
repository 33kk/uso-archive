### Description
This website has an abhorrent amount of bloat and this is just a simple snippet that will help clean up the top side of the website greatly.

I recently migrated 3DSISO Nightly Plus into this style, as I see no purpose in maintaining two separate styles. Nightly Plus was moved into the "Better Nightly WIP" option, which is disabled by default. 

This does not block advertisements. That is a job for your AdBlocker, not Stylish.

### Update notes
-migrated 3DSISO Nightly Plus into this theme so I won't have to double maintain
-removed Server Crash Section, changed name to something more sensible.
-removed New Titles Section
-removed Donation List and Begging Infobox
-removed Gateway, CFW, and Sky3DS Infobox
-removed Cloud Storage Advertisement Infobox
-removed Facebook Login Button
