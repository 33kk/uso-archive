### Description
This style removes "almost" all Twitter bullshit.

DON'T RATE THIS STYLE BAD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK, TWITTER CHANGED THE WEB DESIGN MAKING ALL TWITTER STYLES BROKEN. Use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodtwitter/jbanhionoclikdjnjlcmefiofgjimgca">THIS</a> then log out and make login again to use the older design. 

You can help me fix things on <a href="https://github.com/innerphilim/A-Better-Twitter">Github.</a>

What it removes and do:

1 - @someone liked @anothersomeone bullshit.

2 - That crap of Moments wich I think you don't use so do I.

3 - Shitty Twitter ADS.

4 - Any polution on the sidebars like users to follow and etc.

5 - Expand Twitter media like photos, so you don't have to click on them like a idiot.

6 - Centralize content.

7 - Removes your depression, just kidding.

Thanks to those who helped me to fix and maintain the style:
