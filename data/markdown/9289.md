### Description
This style adds extra glow effects for Firefox Addons site (http://addons.mozilla.org). It can be used without style 7138 (best when both are used), but remember it only works with Firefox "Minefield" 3.1-alpha-pre or later. Text-shadow has been supported since the first nighlies, so why not have fun with it ?
Firefox 3.1 has been renumbered as Firefox "Shiretoko" 3.5 in latest betas, so this style will work for both.

This style has been updated to match v1.4 of style 7138 .

More info and compatibility check, see: http://www.css3.info/preview/text-shadow/
