### Description
Inspired by the upcoming new design of BatchBook seen here (http://support.batchbook.com/discussions/updates-announcements/9-sneak-peak-at-upcoming-bb-redesign-browse-contacts), I thought to put something together modifying the existing site until they launch the new design.  Feel free to submit suggestions or requests as this was put together quickly & the entire site hasn't been scoured for adjustments.

Color palette inspired by "Justin" on Batchbook Forum.

3/1/2010:
• Added icons for footer screencast & FAQ items.
• Altered white for right side boxes to softer tone.
• Blanked out background on H4 items. (Right side sections with grey divider lines.)
• Adjusted H4 again to account for other page transparency.
