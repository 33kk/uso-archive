### Description
A simple style to enhance the candystripe effect on charts, tracklists and forum lists around the lastFM site.

### Update notes
I've given a choice at install from two colours for each of the dark rows, and light rows. You can easily alter the shades later to suit your own taste by editing the style.

The style is set up to work on the English & Russian versions of the lastFM site from the outset. If you need to use a different language version, again it's easy to edit.
