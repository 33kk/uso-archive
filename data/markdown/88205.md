### Description
This is a highly modified copy of Awesum Dark *chan Style. I started using that theme years ago and modified it to my liking and when features and stuff changed on 4chan. I use it with 4chan X so it might not look complete other wise.

I will continue to update as 4chan changes, just give me a bit of time to remember to update here.
