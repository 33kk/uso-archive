### Description
The fixed background on atheistnexus.org appears to be causing fairly large performance issues for some firefox users. This is intended as a temporary fix until the site devs fix the problem. This script will get you far better scrolling performance, but I'm afraid the website will also look considerably uglier. Oh well, like I said, it's temporary.
