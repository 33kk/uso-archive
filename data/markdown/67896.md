### Description
Australis inspired theme made to match my GTK theme, Immunity. (http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/ImmUnity?content=150278)
Also works well with the default Ubuntu Light themes. (Ambiance, Radiance)
Contains code from Australis Styles (http://userstyles.org/styles/61129/australis-styles), and some modified images from what used to be the Australis Redesigned Firefox theme and the elementary GTK theme.
Tested only on Linux with Firefox 13.

ps.: If you would like to make parts of the style optional request in the comments. Also post bugs.
