### Description
<p>Note: Firefox 14 broke this a little.</p>

<p>I wrote this stylesheet to work with my KDE colour scheme, which is applied to Firefox via the oxygen-gtk GTK theme (and previously via QTCurve). It is meant for use with the default Firefox theme.</p>

<p>My desktop colour scheme uses a window background colour of #303030 and a default text colour of #E0E0E0. This stylesheet does not set those colours in any way, but it is written with the assumption that those are the colours that are in use for Firefox's UI. However, it should look okay when used with similar colour schemes too.</p>

<p>This stylesheet:<ul>
<li>changes the identity box background colour to match a dark scheme;</li>
<li>adds a pale, semitransparent radial gradient behind the urlbar favicon;</li>
<li>changes the colour of the fullscreen minimize, restore, close controls to</li>
  match a dark scheme.
</ul></p>

<p>I changed my tab colours in Tab Mix Plus, so this style doesn't cover that.</p>
