### Description
Hide the names of your contacts and groups on the left side by only showing the icons.
The names will be made visible again after hovering your mouse over the icon.

This theme has evolved based on my own requirements, which was privacy.
On the longer term I might add additional features, however I will try to prevent the loss of features if possible.

### Update notes
This style will work with other user styles that customize the theme.
Can conflict with themes that alter the sizing of elements on the screen.

2018/12/05 - Search box now also scales with the chat heads
2018/11/30 - Added a option to hide scrollbars in the chat heads section. I don't want to add visual changes to my style that alter the way scrollbars look, since some style developers use their own styling. In order not to collide with their programming, I've decided to add a hide while not hovering option. This way the nasty looking scrollbars will not be visible at all times
