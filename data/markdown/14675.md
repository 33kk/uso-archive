### Description
I based on many existing styles about this. I should have written somewhere which ones, but I have not. Anyway, my only work was to compile these styles, to clean the script and make the way I like it:
- the active tab is orange with bold font;
- the line between the tab bar and the open website is orange as well;
- the other tabs are gray (or the default theme color, I imagine) when mouse not over;
- read tabs are blue when mouse over;
- unread tabs have bold blue font and, when mouse over, are green.
All this (colors, font specs) can easily be changed on the style.
I only tested it on the default Firefox 3 theme. No idea how it deals with anything else.
Have a nice use!

Update: http://userstyles.org/styles/6125 was definitely the base.
