### Description
For Firefox 4 or later

This makes the addons bar fold into its corner, making it appear with a nice animation when the mouse pointer is near the bottom right of the window.

It does not prevent the use of the scrollbars in the corner.

The buttons that you may put in the addons bar (which is actually the main point of this bar) are handled correctly.

This has been tested and works fine on Windows XP and 7, and Linux.


See also the "Barlesque" extension https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/barlesque/ , that provides a similar experience, with more control.
