### Description
This script modifies websites and UI elements I've run into that don't match whatever color scheme you're running in KDE. It makes the websites that somehow become unreadable or weird-looking look the way they normally do (since they aren't designed to match the OS's theme anyway) and makes the UI elements match the KDE theme.

UPDATE: I found a way to fix text boxes more universally, consistently, and less painstakingly: the inherit option!
