### Description
Code Red is a Firefox userChrome.css theme for lovers of Dark Red, and inspired by Visual Studio Code. 

The images in this picture use an  accompanying firefox theme:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/code-red-dark/

Code Red aims to stylise like Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, but also makes changes to firefox's UI to allow its GUI to be resized to miniscule sizes without breaking usability. Code Red also turns firefox's accent colors to Dark Red, and is compatible with both light and dark themes. 

There are also some small QOL fixes, such as making the searchbar always editable, and making the top bar more compact.
