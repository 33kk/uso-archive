### Description
Translucent header that is clean and minimal, when hovered/used it is more visible again.

Please checkout my other WorkFlowy styles, they compliment each other. I keep them separated into smaller ones so you can choose which bits you want, also use other people's styles as I do with these (I didn't want to repeat what others have done very well so far :) )
