### Description
Now you can see just the myspace login screen instead of all that other crap that comes up with it and if its a little off center go down to where it says, left:200px!important; and change it to 200px to 250 or 150 or whatever until its centered, actually works. 

Somebody got into my bank account and took a bunch of my money :( so if you could be kind enough to donate some money that would be great. Any amount would help :)
