### Description
This style will make scrollbars blend in better with the UI. Scrollbars are hidden ("blended") until hovered, in which case only the scrollbar thumb becomes more visible. Scrollbar arrows are (optionally) removed. Designed for seamless integration with any color scheme. Tested with Classic Compact theme and a few others. Works great with transparent or glass styles!

Note: You will likely need to reload your current page for scrollbar changes to take effect.

Edit: Hiding of scrollbar is now optional.

### Update notes
I borrowed much of the code from http://userstyles.org/styles/47951/hides-scrollbars-till-hover-for-dark-personas, by mdc. 

The scrollbar thumb color and visibility can be adjusted by making appropriate changes to the code where indicated, although the current settings should work fine for any color scheme.

Edit: scrollbar thumb color changed to black. For black themes, you may need to change this to another color, such as grey.
