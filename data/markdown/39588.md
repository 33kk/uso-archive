****IMPORTANT****
to change the background and install your own background pictures, look for ////// background-image: url("") !important; ////////  obviously you will post the desired link between the ""

example  :  background-image: url("file:///C:/Users/Uncle%20Will/Documents/temp%20b-background.png") !important; that selects a picture from my computer.

if you still can't find it, see this pic : http://i56.tinypic.com/2u75aw6.png
