2. Go to the Application tab.
3. Drop down the Cookies menu and click on the youtube link. (https://www.youtube.com)
4. Use the filter search for the word "PREF"
5. Change the Value to al=en&f5=30030&f6=8 (copy and paste) and hit enter.
6. Click on the little refresh icon in the Developer Tools bar and refresh the page.
 
The old youtube layout should return!</b>

### Update notes
Youtube took away the old youtube option without telling anyone. I've added the solution to the problem in the description. Thanks to bensonburner85 on reddit!
