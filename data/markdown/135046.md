### Description
This theme includes plain color hp bars, squared edges, and a dark HP background. Looks best with default dark showdown theme.

Majorish update: Since it was already looking pretty Sun and Moon-y I decided to just add the sun and moon splash background. This can be disabled by commenting out line 3 in the source
