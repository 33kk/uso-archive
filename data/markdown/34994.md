### Description
Really similar to the style I did for beta 1 (based mostly on max2400's skin (http://userstyles.org/styles/33391), this style reduces the tab height and shrinks the firefox button on Firefox 4 Beta 2. The only thing I don't like about this and haven't worked a way around yet is the position of the app tabs; they overlap the back and forward buttons slightly. If anyone has a fix for that let me know.

Worth noting that the favicon bookmarks toolbar was achieved with the smart bookmarks bar extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4072/).
