### Description
Makes Moodle generaly prettier. Wiki pages are not all squished up, forums are cleaned up a bit, some redundant info and useless introduction boxes are removed, etc.

This is specifically designed for the Monash FIT HDR students (if you don't know who they are, you are not one :), but will probably work for other students too.
