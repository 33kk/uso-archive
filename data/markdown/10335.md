### Description
This style changes fonts, makes things fit into smaller boxes, reduces the whitespace, adds a grey background, rounds edges, deletes ads, deletes junk, rationalizes buttons and boxes, and otherwise comprehensively redesigns Facebook. See end of code for deletes. Change as you like.

I do check comments regularly, so if you have suggestions or find broken pages, report them there. 

Dark (Inverted) Version of this available by using (both of) these two styles: style 15215 and style 15138. 

February 2010:
- Updating to newest changes. Am not going to spend too much work on it.

September 2009:
-- Unbroke. Some miscellaneous bug fixes (Button background-colour on the inverted version, e.g.)
-- More miscellaneous bug fixes.

August 2009:
-- Reversed Facebook's latest changes. Let me know if I've missed anything. Update coming to darkened version soon.
-- @ user 26630. See style 19268 for enabling backgrounds.
-- Made the notifications tab look better.
-- Made the help bar into a question mark. 
-- The entire page should almost always be visible. Please report any times it is not.

July 2009:
-- @ user 26450: Facebook Alter does break it. I've added a fix you can comment in in style 19268.
-- Moved tagged people to column beside albums; it should look fine for any albums with > 2 rows of pictures. This could be better done with Greasemonkey.
-- Made popup help bar (originally from the Options menu) standard.
-- Rounded more corners.
-- user 26207 is now content.
-- Fixed problem reported by user 6589. It was already fixed in the fork, but I missed it here.
-- Put gradients on pop ups from presence bar.
-- @ user 4241: See style 19268 for some quick fixes for what you talked about. I'm not going to lower the amount of grey, though moving filters to the right side does help.
-- Rounded the profile pic thumbnails in your inbox
-- Made "Share" button half-decent. Fixed some border rounding around.

June 2009:
-- Adapted to Status Bar changes. The little icons for your various attachment types are hidden. 
-- Finally gave up on moving Events before Highlights after Facebook broke it again; use "Facebook Fixer" Greasemonkey script for that.
-- Gave main bar and comments a gradient. 
-- Made the Add new box tab look better.

May 2009:
-- Changed blue background to grey, gave bottom bars a gradient.
-- Fixed Share stream so the narrow column stays on the right.
-- Adapted to Facebook resizing panel on event pages.
-- Fixed photos problems reported by user 5464.
-- Made Events and Requests scroll and take up a fixed amount of space at all times. 
-- Added a line to force the background to repeat; hopefully that'll fix user 22974 's problem. I've never seen that happen, so... 
-- Fixed problem with profiles breaking, originally reported by both user 19494 and user 15203. I never quite understood what the problem was because I couldn't reproduce it. But I think it's fixed now. If not, let me know. 

April 2009:
-- Moved events to the top of the page so you can find out immediately what's on tap.
-- Many other little fixes.
-- Fixed the problem that user 4339 reported. 

March 2009:
-- Fiddled with Single photo page so that it's easier to see the tags and the photo at the same time. 
-- Adapted to Latest Facebook Redesign
-- Made page footer scroll with the page.
-- Fixed Broken Notes problem reported by user 14920.

February 2009:
-- Fixed Status Composer
-- Fixed Photos
-- Fixed alignment issues of Notes on Profile
-- Made Photo Stories have black background
-- Finally fixed left-hand Profile box alignment issues
-- Increased max-height on left-hand Profile box to account for font-size difference
-- Made boxes have a proper border
-- Silenced Facebook's latest method of notifying us about things.
-- Fixed Help and Developer Pages
-- Made Photos fit properly, changed background of photo table to black. 
-- Deleted background on Status Changer, made it properly rounded.
-- Fixed Public Search Listings


Known issues I'd like to fix: 
 - I shouldn't have used "#content .UIOneOff_Container {width:964px !important;}" in the Layout Changes section. I didn't realize at the time how pervasively Facebook uses the UIOneOff_Container class. It's in so many different contexts, that a lot of the "Fixing" I do elsewhere in the code is to make up for that one line.
