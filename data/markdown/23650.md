### Description
Auto-hide the menu bar to gain more space in the website area and make the toolbar more clean.

I've already used this kind of script and understood why such function don't exists by default in any browser (that I know). It's really awful to seek where is the 1px area, so I decided to use a little bit more of space and put a image to show where to point the cursor.
