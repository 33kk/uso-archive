### Description
Hides the progress bar and current time on YouTube videos - and shows them when you mouse over after a short delay.<br>
Advertisements still show progress, but with a different progress bar element that may look slightly different.

### Update notes
Changelog:
2017-11-25: Big mode fixes (adjusted ad progress bar and increased current time display max-width).
2017-11-05: Fixed the ad progress bar by replacing it with the one that's normally shown when the controls disappear. (Using the usual one didn't reliably hide the main video progress.)
2017-11-09: Fixed fading time incorrectly appearing behind video length when entering and exiting video ads.
