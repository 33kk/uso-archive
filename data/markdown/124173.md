### Description
SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH, FOR ME IT'S FOREIGN LANGUAGE.
This style base at this style: https://userstyles.org/styles/95554/mac-os-x-scrollbars-for-firefox 
But for me my style better. So, you can just try to use it.This style change original scrollbar to better one. I wanted to find normal style for scrollbar, but didn't find anything. I don't know CSS so good to write my own style, so I decided to chang one's.
