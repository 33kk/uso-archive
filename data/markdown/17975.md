### Description
An alternative to style 17453

For Stylish users who liked the old logo more than the new one, but also want a fresh change for version 1.01.  This icon keeps with the theme of the old paper and brush while also adding the 'S' and making things more vibrant and colourful.

You can also modify this style to add your own custom icons.
