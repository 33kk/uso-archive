### Description
This style is a combination of a few different styles I've seen. It makes the app menu button a transparent Firefox logo. It also moves the tabs to the same row as the app menu and makes the full "alt" menu more in-line with the first tab. The way I've worked it, these things happen both when Firefox is and is not maximized.
