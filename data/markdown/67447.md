### Description
A style that removes nothing from the page but clutter.

(1) Collapses the page header to a thin horizontal strip at the top of the screen - mouse over the strip to expand the header again.
(2) Collapses the left sidebar menu to a thin vertical strip at the left edge of the screen - mouse over the strip to expand the sidebar again.
(3) Collapses the page footer to a thin horizontal strip at the bottom of the page - mouse over the strip to expand the footer again.

The sidebar scrolls independently of the rest of the page, and never scrolls out of view when the page scrolls. The header can either be attached to the screen so that it never scrolls out of reach, or attached to the page so that it scrolls when the page scrolls. Ditto for the footer.

### Update notes
All pages on <a href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/">freewarefiles.com</a> will use this style. It is <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">valid CSS 3</a>. (Woohoo!)

N.B.: I use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>. If this page looks busier in your browser than in the screenshot, that's probably why. I also believe that no news is good news - I'll assume that this style works correctly until I see a comment to the contrary.
