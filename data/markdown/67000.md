### Description
Autohide the headers and footer. Nothing is removed from the page, only hidden at one of the edges of the screen. (Out of sight!)

### Update notes
This style hides the header, footer, and sidebars by reducing them to thin placeholders at the top, bottom, and left edge of the screen, and expands them again when you mouse over a placeholder.

Style is applied to all pages on <a href="http://tvlistings.aol.com/">tvlistings.aol.com</a>. Despite what I said above, the two banner ads are deleted, as is the redundant search box at the bottom of the page. (Apologies - they're easily restored, though, if you want them back.)

N.B.: I use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>. If this page looks busier in your browser than in the screenshot, that's probably why.

14 Jul: Display the hidden headers as site icons instead of as gray stripes.
