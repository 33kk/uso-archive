### Description
This style is meant for Slashdot.org, a news site for people interested in IT and technology.

It removes:
 - Sidebars (optional)
 - Tags (optional)
 - Unnecessary whitespace
 - The day breaks (don't care when news was posted, just show it)

It changes:
 - Grey/black background
 - Centers articles with a fixed width of 900px
 - Moves the 'from the ... dept' text to the right side of the article subheader

Note:
 - I ranted about their code before, but with the latest redesign they've produced proper HTML. Very possible to style, so: yay!

### Update notes
Updated 27-12-2015.

Fixed 'new' layout elements. Not a great style anymore, but works well enough again.
