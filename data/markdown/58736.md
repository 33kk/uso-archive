### Description
This is the same as 'Ivar's Translucent Firefox V2' except with total transparency on the newtab page.

V1 rel DEC/31/2011 - This is version 1 of "Ivar's Translucent Firefox - Clear Minimalism".  This is a conglomeration of my work and lots of UserStyles that I have enjoyed and still use.  I hacked my collection into one page, never thinking I'd be sharing. I cut & paste in lieu of installation from UserStyles and don't recall where credits are due but if you see something here that you authored, please contact me so I can remedy the situation.

Pinned tabs can be a problem if there are too many opened tabs (see "More Info"), which are 'invisible' on the left (if you hover over them, the popup will tell you what tab it is).
