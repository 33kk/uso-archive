### Description
I probably won't be updating this any more, because I just don't have time.

It changes the Google Docs page to a grey and green color scheme, and rearranges some of the headers to clean up a bit.
I am trying to leave the document edit/compose fields untouched, so that there isn't any interference with what you are trying to create or edit.
I'm also replacing a few images as necessary, but haven't done the entire site. I'll probably just finish the editors for the document types I use less frequently when I actually start to use those document types.

It matches 
style 17417
style 27060
style 22379
style 22386
style 17685
