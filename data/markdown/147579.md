### Description
This forces a certain font on all websites, allowing you to use, for example, any fonts you've made or fonts no website designer would use! Open the "advanced settings" on this page to set this up! <b>Jokerman</b> was used in the screenshot.

### Update notes
Added font size settings for if your fonts are too small, like some Fontstruct fonts.
