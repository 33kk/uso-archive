### Description
For Firefox 3.6+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds, also works well on Google Chrome.

With the recent userstyles.org update things look a little odd and out of place, so this is a simple style to change the page layout color and to remove and rearrange a few page layout elements to make it easier on the eyes.

Tested on Firefox 3.6+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

Modified code from Userstyles:

style 44360

style 43836

user 13023

user 14255

To customize or fix Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds, you can also have a look at my other styles: user 61655
