### Description
When you use the private mode a lot, the purple warning sign can get a little distracting, and also, if you wanted to keep secrecy about using the private tab, the purple page on every new tab will make it obvious from a distance.
This makes the page dull grey, with everything very faded, so it doesn't attract a lot of attention.
