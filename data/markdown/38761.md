When posting comments on Livejournal, makes more visible the alert which reads:

"Notice! This user has turned on the option that logs your IP address when posting."

The CSS for other Livejournal clones (Journalfen, Insanejournal, Dreamwidth) is also included, but commented out.  To use this style on those sites, remove the " /*  */ " from around the CSS.
