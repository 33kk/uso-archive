### Description
version 0.1.1

--[description]------------------------------------
Any phpbb2 forum (and forks of phpbb2 appearing in some CMS) which uses the subSilver image filenames (which is most, because it is the default theme and usually used as a template).

Part 1:  There are a lot of images, so it's a large file, and broken into two parts for posting here.
Part 2:  style 5196

This is also a graphics pack add-on for:
style 4407

The images are GIF and PNG, transparent background.

Add domains and urls you want styled to the @-moz-document block.  Copy your @-moz-document block to clipboard before allowing Stylish to update, so you don't loose them.  I can't offer to add domains on this one.

Before Screenshot: Shows this style enabled, without applying any other styles.
After Screenshot: Shows this style enabled alongside style 4407

--[series]-----------------------------------------
The "painted clearly" series replaces images with transparent background PNGs.  I usually encode them PNG-8, selective palette, with as little data as needed to not be ugly on my 32bit-color displays.
