### Description
Nothing says "get it done" like a big dumb sans-serif.  Large Helvetica Neue Light (for Mac kids in their ascots), stylized tabs, cow removed.

In case the font is just too big, you can set it to you liking.  The property to look for is :

.xtd_text, .xtd_entry input {
  font-size: 24px !important;
