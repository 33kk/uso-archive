### Description
All credit should go to the original creator of 'Facebook Black' but I did notice that a lot of their code was bloated and some of its functionality had been lost (be that by original coding, or facebook having updated their design causing incompatibilities) Anyway my version fixes the following issues:

Home Hover Fixed
Menu Down Arrow Hover Fixed
More/Less Applications on Left-Pane Restored
Unnecessary CSS Elements Removed
CSS Shortened
More Advertisements Hidden

UPDATE: 31/05/10

Wow, haven't checked UserStyles for a while; but pleased to see so many downloads! Unfortunately this theme is now 3 or 4 versions of Facebook out-of-date so won't work and I don't have any plans to update it, don't install.

UPDATE: 15/01/08

Sidebar Menu Now Also Black

Amendments Post-Facebook Update:
You may have noticed the search bar cocked up yesterday, Facebook changed their coding. This broke this CSS Patch and I have now repaired it. It was too much effort to edit the new Search Button so I just removed it, its uneccesary in Firefox anyway.

Thanks For Downloading!
