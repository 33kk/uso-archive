### Description
Wrote this KoL theme from scratch, ± (more or less). It's completely different from style 22564 (also by me) in that there are absolutely no shadows. 

The main idea is to color everything in the background layers, while preserving the white background color of any elements containing images.

NOTE:
If you find anything screwy happening to colors or borders or whatever, please Kmail me (in-game mail) and leave me a brief description of the area you're in, as well as a link to a screenshot so I can figure out where it is in the game. My character is often in Hardcore mode, and can't access all the areas you probably can.

If you want, leave a complaint here and try to specify what looks wrong, so I can fix it.
Feedback is !important. :P
