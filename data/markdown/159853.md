### Description
This is a pure CSS transliteration of names and agencies on the main vote page for PRODUCE 48 located at http://produce48.mnet.com/pc/vote

This is only for that specific page, and does not provide transliterations or translations for anything besides the trainees' names and agencies/48group. To avoid confusion, I used the spellings on their profiles on this site.

This style will be updated when more profiles are added. If there are any issues, please contact me on Twitter @XinChun93 or Discord @Sei#2975
