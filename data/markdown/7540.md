### Description
** Take a quick glance at my other styles and see if you like any :) **

Idea came from the style 'tvguide.com - minimalist listings' by Webb (http://userstyles.org/styles/1788) but all the coding was done by me and is also done in a minimal amount of coding too (or at least the smallest amount I could muster).

If I missed an ad or need to change anything lemme know. This is my second style so I'd like some tips for efficiency or whatever you can give :).

PS - this isn't mine but I figured I'd give it some love because without it userstyles.org would be unbearable for me: 
"userstyles.org - screenshots unresized & vertical" by mod_wastrel
