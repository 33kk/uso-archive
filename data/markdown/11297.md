### Description
NOTE: This is a slightly modified port of the popular style 10637, and I loved it on my Vista computer. Unfortunately, on my main computer, an XP, this style wouldn't work (okay, worked, but with ugly-looking parts). Therefore, I made this style. Please be nice to me, this is my first style. I'll see if people like it or not.

CREDITS:

user 14909, and his wonderful style, style 10637, where most of this style comes from.
user 140, and his wonderful style, style 398, making it possible to make the active tab bigger.

Sorry if I didn't acknowledge everybody; I really only used style 10637 and I may have indirectly used someone else's stuff.

Now, onto the installation.

YOU WILL NEED:

A computer running XP (for Vista, just use style 10637)
Firefox 3, with Stylish (duh)
the addon Personal Menu ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3895 )

DO THE FOLLOWING:
Note: you must follow every single step! Do not leave out any; that's what I tried while using style 10637, and it did not work out.

1. Verify you have everything you need.
2. On the toolbar, right click then click 'Customize...'
3. Tick 'Use Small Icons', and drag back/forward, address and search bars (and anything else) to the 'Menus' toolbar. Do NOT ignore this step.
4. On the toolbar, right click and untick 'Navigation Toolbar' to hide that bar. We won't need it anymore; make sure everything on it has been moved to the "menus" toolbar.
5. Play around with stuff, get it looking right!
6. Put your bookmarks and anything you want (see screenshot for what I mean) to be on the Bookmarks Toolbar on the (duh) Bookmarks Toolbar!
7. Now load this script into Stylish.

Known problems: 1) the list all tabs thing floats right behind the last tab.

NOTE: If you want to use large icons, open up the style editor, and scroll down to where there is a giant blank, a line of stars, and another giant blank. Underneath that, look down to the sixth line, where you will see comments. Follow that comment to change it to large icon looks. Have fun!
