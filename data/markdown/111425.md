### Description
ATTENTION!!!
This Script is discontinued and may become outdated.
==================================================

This is an old style I made for the site: http://shellcity.net

One I never publish until today. It's a very basic alternative color scheme and other small adjustments I like, but nothing major, except maybe that the minimum wide in pixels that I recommend to use with this style is 1250 or more.
