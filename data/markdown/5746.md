### Description
Whenever you click a watch video link on you tube , this userstyle makes the video centre and take up the whole screen. It removes all other features like comments because I find them useless as youtubers have nothing educated to say anyway.  This is based on the 'youtube.com - Video Only (Winter 2007)' theme I only modified it.
