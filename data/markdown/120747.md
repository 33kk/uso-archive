### Description
A nice simple dark blue theme for W3schools.  I made sure to click around to find all the odd parts that don't color the way you think they should.

Unfortunately some of the UI elements are not CSS, they're HTML.  So I wasn't able to make it super clean like I wanted.

*** no need for my greasemonkey script anymore ***
