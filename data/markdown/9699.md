### Description
ｷﾀ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!

v1.2

New stuff you may have missed:
-Aligned to accommodate widescreen
-Firefox extension skinned to best of my abilities
-Pretty much complete

This is just a simple Burichan recolor of the Yotsuba-Chan skin, and STILL has all the same stuff from the 4chan improvement style (http://userstyles.org/styles/5200). Looks best in Futaba and Burichan.

(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞

From 4chan improvement:
-Rounded corners on replies
-No ads
-fixed position post area that scrolls with the page (mouseover opacity)
-fixes blurry thumbnails in fx3

New Stuff:
-Yotsuba background
-Rounded corners on post area and op post
-No border between threads
-No "Reply Mode" bar
-Blue/green color scheme tweaked from Burichan original
-OP post has background color, table is tucked behind thumb

(´_ゝ｀)

NOTES about the screenshot:
-I'm using the 4chan firefox extension

( ゜▽゜)=◯)`ν゜)

Issues:
-Not 100% skin: Front page tables not covered (but why would you go there anyway?)
-In some non-worksafe boards, the reply field gets shifted off-center. I don't know how to fix this
-Code is messy and probably contains a bunch of unecessary stuff in it

Please provide feedback, lemme know what you think.

About me and my styles, and how to get me to make more of them:

I update my styles a lot because I often make stupid little mistakes AND I like to tweak stuff to death, so make sure you always have the most current versions of the styles. I will note a few important changes in the description.

Thanks for the big number of installs on the Konata skin! I am truly flattered. Because of this response, trust me, I will continue to make more skins in the future. In fact, if you drop me a line I will even take commissions. At this point, my proposed prices are 10 bux for a 4chan skin and 20 bux for other websites. This is because I have more knowledge of the 4chan CSS and am not yet a full-fledged CSS wizard, so each new site will have a bit of a learning curve for me. Also in general there are still several things I don't know how to do, but I could easily make some skins even more involved than my current ones with a little bit of research.

COMMISSIONS IN SUMMARY:

-$10 for 4chan skins and $20 for other sites. If the skin is pitifully simple I'll drop it to $5
-Talk to me at kifte_arcane@hotmail.com or quiche on Rizon
-Tell me what you want and I will try my best to deliver
-I will work closely with you and you'll see beta screens
-Skins could take up to a week to complete
-If I fail at making the skin for some reason, you don't pay
-Payment is expected once I tell you a skin has been completed and show final screens

Also, random acts of donation are highly appreciated. WHY DON'T YOU PAY ME A LOT, FOREVER?
