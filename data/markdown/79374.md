### Update notes
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul><li><strong>If you like this style, please create a quick account and give it a <a href="https://forum.userstyles.org/post/discussion?Discussion/StyleID=79374">green thumbs up</a>.</strong></li>
<li>For more options, see the supplementary style: "<i>Style 88820</i>"</li>
<li>If you'd like to be able to toggle between dark and light modes, install this in light mode and then install Style 96481</li>
<li>Styles with options (like this one) don't update automatically, have to be uninstalled to be updated sometimes, and have to be uninstalled to reselect new options.</li>
<li>Dark-mode overrides are more aggressive attempts at darkening everything, but will sometimes darken things that shouldn't be darkened (like the phylogeny timelines on a species' page).</li>
<li>Transparent panels (like the navigation) restore on mouseover.</li></ul>

<strong>Known issues:</strong>
<ul><li>Some users have the reference-tooltip boxes flying off from where they're supposed to be, but I can't determine the cause yet.</li>
<li>Page editor isn't all darkened.</li></ul>

<strong>Known issues, unfixable-ish:</strong>
<ul><li>In dark mode, some images with transparency that shouldn't have white backgrounds do, and some that should don't - it isn't possible to tell them apart by their code sometimes.</li>
<li>In dark mode, some tables with colored cells are instead transparent, even without 'Dark mode overrides' (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Swatches">Ex</a>)... it isn't possible to darken all of the boxes in normal articles without affecting these tables too, so you'll have to disable the style when using these.</li>
<li>In dark mode, code boxes aren't darkened.</li>
<li>Dark mode's background repeat possibly broken on some setups, but I can't determine the cause yet.</li></ul>

Jul 20<sup>th</sup> & 26<sup>th</sup>, 2013 — Wikipedia added a background color to the Table of Contents, making it light - fixed. <i>(Note: you can avoid having to update for changes like this by selecting "errythang" in the override option.)</i> Some edit buttons weren't being hidden, for that option - fixed.
Jul 13<sup>th</sup>, 2013 — <small>Many many small fixes, some small tweaks.</small> Wikipedia made changes to edit buttons and editing - partially adjusted for. Front page search boxes were sometimes transparent in Chrome - fixed.
