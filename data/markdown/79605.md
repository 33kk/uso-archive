### Description
Centres the site design of YouTube, because extreme left is silly.

Still some work to do on the header, possibly. I might leave it as is.


Also, unlike most people, aside from the left alignment I quite like the new YouTube and won't change anything else about it. Except maybe re-locating the title above the video.
