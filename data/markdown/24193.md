### Description
Several changes to reduce vertical white space and other tweaks to the geocaching.com site.  CSS is heavily commented and individual sections can be removed or tweaked.

For maximum enjoyment, I suggest using this in tandem with Chrysalides's greasemonkey script found here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/66400
