### Description
This style removes: the Gmail logo, border lines between messages in your inbox, and some other links on the bottom and right of the page.
It also centers the search bar.

It is intended to function independently of color styles like style 17417

2011 11 08 - Commented out the removal of the message meta-pane. Not sure if this needs "cleaning up," so you can un-comment it if you want to hide that stuff when viewing messages.
2011 05 03 - Div class for Gmail logo changed
