### Description
If you have a Roku box, you can visit the channel store in a web  browser as well as through the Roku. Each channel has a 185px thumbnail with words below it. 

I found it too hard to tell the small blue "Add Channel" text from the small green "Installed" text when skimming the page to find channels I'd missed.

This style makes "Add Channel" into big yellow buttons that react when you press them. 

If you already installed a channel, it doesn't get a big yellow button. Instead, "installed" takes on the appearance of a disabled control the same height as the "add channel" buttons.
