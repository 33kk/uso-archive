### Description
My first style, a reskin of GMail.

*Updated September 15, 2007
- Worked on some basic kluges for HTML email with white backgrounds

*Updated August 1, 2007
- Fixed dropdowns for font size and face selection with some help from Yeraze
- Toned contrast down a little
- Made search bar more reasonable for people without enormous monitors
- Changed colors of the different contributers to a thread (only goes 6 deep, I haven't seen any threads with more people involved to know what colors are there)
- Styled the advanced Filter and Search options\
- Fixed tooltips to be readable with some more help from Yeraze
*


- Added a wide search bar at the top and removed the 'Search Mail' and 'Search the Web' buttons (added to be consistent with http://userstyles.org/styles/1690)
- Simplified various buttons and repetitive toolbars when viewing messages/message threads

The font choice and text size dropdown menus use Javascript mouseovers to control the background color, and I wasn't sure how to fix that with Stylish.  If someone wants to tackle that problem with Greasemonkey, feel free.
