### Description
This is just a quick user style to make Daring Fireball responsive to various window sizes. It also improves readability, using the Apple native San Fransisco typeface, and larger, more readable text throughout.

There is a Github for this style, and that is <a href="https://github.com/good/fireball-userstyle">located here.</a>
