### Description
Changes the Tumblr interface into a slightly more compact one. It is mostly compatible with Missing E and XKit. Several different backgrounds and colours for your dashboard.

Will feature different colours. Blue, green, purple, red, orange, and transparent are available at the moment.

Check back later for chocolate, gray, and pink!

Have feature ideas? Want a specific colour? A specific background? Send me a message http://not-good-with-computer.tumblr.com

Bugs:
- Some pages may display in the most ugly way possible, please, PLEASE report them.
- Always visible header breaks j/k navigation altogether, auto-hide breaks it only on classic dashboard.
- Without Missing E the only scheme that looks good is Brave, sadly there's no easy fix for this.
