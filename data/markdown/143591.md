### Description
Goes much further than just changing colors or changing fonts. Generally the goal is to fade back or hide the less important stuff, enlarge the more important stuff. At our shop, we don't use Conversations and barely use Calendar. So those are hidden. We don't often change who's on a team so that's hidden. Etc.
