### Description
<b>Make Twitch.tv Grey(t) again.</b><br/>
This userstyle (mostly) brings back the Grey dark-mode styling previously provided by BetterTTV before Twitch changed their front-end to react.
<br/><br/>
Requires dark mode to be to be activated on Twitch, either under BetterTTV settings or in the drop-down menu on the top right of the website. 
<br/><br/>
It is heavily recommended that you use the BetterTTV extension together with this Userstyle.
<br/><br/>
This userstyle will not be held on the same standard as the old dark mode from BetterTTV, it is a personal project because I can't handle the glaring purple. I have not tested this on every browser/section of twitch.
<br/><br/>
If you have any issues or suggestions, talk to me on Discord (dansa#0001) or Twitter (@dansaDisco)
<br/><br/>
Most of the color choices are taken from the old BetterTTV CSS, I take no real credit for this work and you are free to use/redistribute this as you wish.
