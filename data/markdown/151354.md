### Description
Originally uploaded by Malthe, I fixed it so that it went inactive on the home screen. To be honest, that made it look kind of ugly.
UPDATE: Google recently updated their Google Drive apps to change the UI at the top of the screen. This somewhat breaks the theme; however, I actually kind of like the way the theme looks now, and so I will not change it.
