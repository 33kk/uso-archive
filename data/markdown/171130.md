### Description
Constantly reading through the FAQ page in it's default color scheme is tiring, so why don't we hop on the dark theme train? This user style does exactly that. Darkens the entire page, while creating a subtle contrast among the text elements. Caution: this uses global styles due to the HTML markup lacking a unique ID or otherwise for the page.
