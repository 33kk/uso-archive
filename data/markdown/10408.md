### Description
MySpace BandView - optimizes MySpace for non-members to look up bands
by Dan Rasmussen <http://danrasmussen.org>

Some of us aren't members of MySpace, and will never be. MySpace BandView hides those parts of the site that aren't useful to us, and tidies a few things up.

Here's what it does:
1) Hides the background image - makes for faster scrolling
2) Hides the MySpace-specific contact table
3) Hides the list of MySpace friends
4) Hides the MySpace friend comments
5) Makes some of the text bigger* (when the default is too small)

*: I'd like some help to get this working better. I've spent too much time working on it already. Maybe at some point I'll have interest in doing it myself, but it will get fixed sooner if I get help.
The following is either too small, or irregulary sized:
General Info: Band Website, Band Members, Influences, Sounds Like
Upcoming Shows: heading, "view all" link, venues.

This style isn't perfect. If you send me corrections and suggestions, I would be happy to take them into consideration for posting an update. My contact information is on my website, http://danrasmussen.org/contact

To do at some point:
Fix text sizes (see above)
Widen page (left and right margins are rather large.
Make links stand out a bit (not always easy to tell from text).
Make section headers smaller.

If you're interested in blocking ads or flash, look up the Firefox plugins "AdBlock" and "NoScript".
