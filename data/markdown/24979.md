### Description
By default Compact Menu 2 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4550) has kind of an unpleasant icon. I came up with something to accompany style 8620 by MBLUE.
As of Compact Menu 2 v. 3.1.x the add-on seems to support multiple icon by itself. But as I couldn't figure out how to use this I think this style is more flexible.
