### Description
With their new forum software Gameforge changed the style of their Runes of Magic forums. Unfortunately many users do not like the new style's colors. 

This stylesheet tries to solve the problem by recoloring fonts, colors and backgrounds of the forum to have less aggressive contrasts, while containing some fixes for missing element styling or incorrect page layout.

### Update notes
Change Log:
v1.2
- hide those unnecessary user rank images of mentors, moderators, etc...

v1.1

- made box-shadow configurable
- some minor stuff

v1.0
