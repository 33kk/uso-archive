### Description
You can hardly pull up a single article in Wikipedia without it having a big bold warning box on top, pushing down the actual content, just to tell you things like:

"This article does not cite any references or sources."
"This article or section may contain original research or unverified claims."
"The tone or style of this article or section may not be appropriate for Wikipedia."
"This article/section is missing citations or needs footnotes."
"This article has been nominated to be checked for its neutrality."
and so on.

...which are practically *to be expected* in a Wikipedia article anyway.

This userscript hides those warning boxes.
