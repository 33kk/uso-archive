### Description
Ever wanted to completely hide some or all of your notifications on your Tumblr dashboard? Try this! (Only works on dashboard.)

### Update notes
Please use the dropdown options to choose what you want to hide. Hides every notification but replies by default.

2018/02/06 note: Now hides notifications you got a new ask, because I forgot those existed. I'm waffling over whether to hide answertime banners/notifications but New XKit hides those so I think I'll leave that to them.
