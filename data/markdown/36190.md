### Description
I really enjoyed Craptacular's reddit syle [http://userstyles.org/styles/23440], but there were a few things that annoyed me that I wanted fixed before I started using it, so I just fixed them myself.

Summary of my changes....

1. Made the sidebar bigger.  On his version, it is ridiculously tiny, and it causes the content to go down much lower than original.  Mine is a similar width to the default stylesheet.

2. Changed the link colors [visited and nonvisited] so they are the default colors.  Thought they were too dull in craptacular's version.

3. Fixed the bug in craptacular's version which caused the links in the sidebar and the footer to change colors when visited, which looks awkward.  [ie: changes the "Create your own reddit" link color, which it shouldnt]

4. Removed some of the link hover effects.  [I found them to be a little annoying]

5. Made some of the text bigger. [some text in craptacular's version is 8 or 9px, an almost unreadable size without getting closer to the monitor]

6 [aug 29 update]: added the clickable subreddit name on the subreddit pages.
