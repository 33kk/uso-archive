### Description
<h1>Google Music's new design wasn't made with desktop in mind.</h1>
Probably won't work anymore. Maybe I'll ever make an update.
This theme strives to change that- by taking some design choices from Microsoft Groove's web design and putting them together with Material design.

This theme provides a much flatter experience, with smaller buttons and smaller menus so that more albums can be visible on your screen at once, focusing on content and clarity rather than beautiful box shadows.
