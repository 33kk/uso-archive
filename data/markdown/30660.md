### Description
** ONLY WORKS WELL WITH FIREFOX 3.6+ FOR NOW. I cannot stress this enough. This style, at this moment, uses -moz-linear-gradient(); which is only supported in the newer versions of Firefox.

dAmn chats restyled to match the rest of dA v7. Designed with simplicity, aesthetics and practicality in mind. Not overly flashy like some of my other styles.

Made with the suggestions and ideas supplied by my friends and supporters.

Works with TinydAmn, SuperdAmn and dAmnColors very well, and I would actually recommend downloading those particular Greasemonkey scripts.
