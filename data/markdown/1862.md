### Description
This is an attempt at making the articles and front page of the nytimes.com site less 'busy' and more useful - in particular for readers who do not need local info but just want the news. 

- Links to various alternative ways to browse the site (my times, today's paper, etc.) are removed
- Ads, personals, weather info and similar reader services are removed.
- Articles display redux-style (looses some links to other sections and articles for a less cluttered display)

For advertising blocking purposes this style should be used in conjunction with the Adblock (Plus) extension.
