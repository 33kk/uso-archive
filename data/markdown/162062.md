### Description
Just a really quick dark theme I threw together for the new design so I didn't have to look at a white website.
Pretty sure I got most of the white and I tried to keep it at least somewhat consistent, but it is what it is.

If you have any suggestions or find anything that seems broken message me on Discord, slendercraft#0913.

Make sure to check out my custom character cutout style as well! :)
