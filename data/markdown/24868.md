### Description
Well... dark grey Flickr!
It's an absolute *must* for photographers!
It may not cover absolutely *everything*, for instance, there may be some elements that don't show often, that I didn't feel too important to style. 
However, everything directly visible and the most common elements are styled and coloured properly.
If you see any problems with the style, feel free to contact me.
Includes spaceball remover... as in, it allows you to save images by removing protective layers.
Please note that in new view page, you have to zoom in, in order to save.
Also note that some elements are almost impossible to style; for others, I am waiting for Flickr to settle and finish updating the markup before I apply fixes.
Enjoy! Cheers!
