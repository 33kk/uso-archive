### Description
This style is designed to blend the appbutton (Firefox's orange menu button) into the fxOpera theme.

6/21/13 - I forgot to mention that it won't look right unless you use the Tabs Always in Titlebar extension. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tabs-always-in-titlebar/

6/24 - After installation, if your window is maximized it, unmaximize the window and maximize again to see the design properly. This style modifies some of the margins and Firefox has to adjust.

7/10 - Uploaded the wrong v2.0 code by mistake. All fixed now.
