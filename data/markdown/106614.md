### Description
A light version of the default theme created (sort of) by LukeLC.

When I browse the site on a mobile device, I sometimes get a broken version of an old theme (or so I presume it to be) rather than the new theme that should be displayed. Well, I actually like this old theme better, myself, so I recreated it from a couple screenshots and added a few tweaks of my own to complete the look in the most usable and aesthetically-pleasing way possible. If you find dark themes a bit hard on the eyes or just want a change of pace, I hope you enjoy this theme!
