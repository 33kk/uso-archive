### Description
Meh, I took the code from "Browsin /a/ with C.C" and messed around with it, so now all pages from zip.4chan.org open with this skin, and Sanya is the background~~~. It is really basic, and I basically know jack shit about html and html colour coding. HOWEVER, I wanted something for Sanya fans to be happy with.

You can modify the colours in the file itself, if I can do it, it isn't that hard.

All coding credit goes to the creator of the "Browsing /a/ with C.C" skin.

Thanks!

EDIT: Optimized colours to what I like. Feel free to change 'em.
