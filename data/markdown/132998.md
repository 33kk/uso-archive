### Description
A Black Theme for tss.asenheim.org "Nostalgic Visual Novels on-line" plus some extra features.
Even though Asenheim is great, the playing environment in the site always bothered me. From the white background, to the distracting menus and the bilinear filter from the browser zoom, so I finally decided to fix it myself.

### Update notes
<blockquote><b>You can configure the options in the <u>⚙️ Customize Settings</u> button up top ⬆</b></blockquote >


Features: 
 ● Dark Background
 ● Option to choose between scaling modes: Nearest Neighbor or Bilinear
 ● Scanlines
 ● Screen Noise
 ● Color Contrast
 ● Obscures the Sidebar and the Music Menus, and will show up when hovering
 ● Replaced the Sidebar Buttons

I also tried to add a persistent 2X zoom using the "transform: scale(2);" css tag, so you didn't need to use the browser zoom, but it would cause problems when registering mouse clicks in some games. Not sure why it happens, but it seems to consistently happen on all browsers.
Complement it with Browser Zoom (Preferably 2X) and Fullscreen for better experience.
[Since Firefox handles browser Zoom awkwardly (not zooming from the center) <b>I'd recommend using this in Chrome instead.</b>]
