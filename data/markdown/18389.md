### Description
I was experiencing some problems with elements on the site overlapping, particularly on the Achievement Guide pages, plus the big margins on the left & right sides kinda bugged me. This makes the main content portion of the site span the entire browser window, as opposed to an absolute 1000 pixels. I also removed the useless top banner graphic. Finally, because the resizing causes the graphics to go even more out of alignment, I simply removed all the background graphics and changed the background to simple white. This is my first Stylish script and I used it as an opportunity to start teaching myself about how CSS works :) I might make a better version at some point, but for now it works fine.
