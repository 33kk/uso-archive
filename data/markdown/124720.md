### Description
Smarter Tags. I actually use "Work a Simpler Flowy v2.0" which works well with this, so I'd recommend checking his/her script out too.

This creates a full width tag, for a calendar style view, with many options. I don't use them all, but added some extra in case someone out there wanted them. So take a look in the CSS for them all (#Now, #Next #ThisWeek, #NextWeek, #Monday... etc)

I also have tags for #Important, #Due, #Event, #Note which I use beneath the day heading. These are coloured red, orange, green, yellow respectively.
