### Description
SpeedRunsLive has done great, but responsive UI is so nice I had to throw something together. No longer fuss about all the wasted space/repositioning -- let the UI respond to your screen size.

This was a quick project with the main target being the initial page of www.speedrunslive.com. The other pages have not been optimized as of yet. This should make the experience a lot nicer for those, like me, that hop around the front page all day.

More to come!
