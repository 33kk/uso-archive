### Description
*** ADDED FLAT OR SHADOW OPTION ***
Select your desired style with the options below.

~~~ REGARDING SIZE CHANGES ~~~
If you wish the download bars to be bigger or smaller please use the options in download status bar itself, changing the size options will not affect the layout or colours of the bars. :)

Please keep the feedback coming.

This is a great new style for download statusbar which looks great in Firefox 4 and goes well with the default theme, it removes the word buttons and replaces with nicer icon buttons. Also stylises the download bars themselves to make them much nicer looking. Further it adds a glass tooltip instead of the default yellow one. Finally colour codes download status for improved interface.

This is an amalgamation of a few different styles, thanks go out to:
* Style 42771 
* Style 1015 
* Style 45283

All helped to make this style possible.
