### Description
The screenshots should spell it out. This stylesheet gets rid of the wasted space and ads on the boards while maintaining functionality. It is meant to be used with IGN's Classic theme and is now compatible with Vesti Tools. This stylesheet doesn't do anything to fonts or colors other than the blue areas at the top and bottom.

Additional bluetex 3 stylesheets:
(These can be used with or without the Main Stylesheet)
style 878
style 885
style 880
style 882 and style 883 (combine for invisitext)
style 884 (for Classic theme)
style 25703 (for Classic theme)
style 23374

NOTE: I only release what I actually use. So since I've been using Vesti Tools lately, I've made some fixes for it and am releasing it for you all. I only use the Classic theme, which has a totally different HTML/CSS layout than the other themes. I seriously don't have the time (or desire) to be maintaining three different stylesheets for what amounts to three different websites, two of which I never use. I'm not asking for donations, so I feel completely justified being a lazy ass about this.

This stylesheet shouldn't break the Grey and White themes, it just won't do much more than shrink the area at the very top. There are probably other stylesheets that fix up those themes which you can combine with mine, I dunno. I've labeled the different sections in my code and even put in short descriptions for most things to make it easier for you CSS coders out there to change things around. You can use parts of it in your own scripts and release it, I don't care.

So if you aren't using the Classic theme (the third little theme square up top) and there are some problems, I'm sorry, but I'm probably not going to be doing much about it.
