### Description
I thought that the top navigation bar of DeviantArt is way to big - so I made it smaller. The other thing is that you need the bar always on top of the screen (to navigate forward and backward) so it would be cool to have it fixed instead of let it scroll of if you view a bigger image. I changed that too.

It's not perfect but it works.
