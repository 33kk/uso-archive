### Description
Pins the global navigation bar to the top instead of it going over the Wiki's header as you scroll down, made it transparent too. Removed all I am aware of.

I've had this script for several years, I just add more and more code so it's a bit of a mess now because some of these codes might no longer be working since FANDOM updates a lot, but this still works so it doesn't matter. I finally decided to upload this and I'll continue to update it for as long as I could.
