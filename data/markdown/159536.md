### Description
Red & Black centered theme for lichess.org. Originally made for myself but due to few people actually also using it I strongly revamped it.
NOTE: ONLY DARK LICHESS THEME IS SUPPORTED AT THE MOMENT, MAKE SURE ITS ON

You can also find couple red & black themed boards replacing some of less used board themes in the usual lichess board theme selector.

I also use the arrows style for red/black/white themed arrows (not by me)
