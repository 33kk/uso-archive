### Description
When I switched to the new Gmail I had no less than 3 internal scrollbars (and that's not including the ones for widgets!). One on the left column, one on right-side chat and one on my main mail. This gets rid of them, replacing them with a good old fashioned master scrollbar for the whole page - Enjoy!
