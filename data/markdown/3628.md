### Description
We tried this for Thunderbird but the image is brought up in a newly composed message as the "stationary"
Anyone know a fix?
In the meantime, to continue using the image, in Thunderbird, we've replaced our TBird start page (in "Preferences . . .) with:
http://www.primetap.com/TBirdBB.html
HOWEVER, this code can be used in Firefox if you like the look of the TBird.
