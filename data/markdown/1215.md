### Description
Dataface is an Application Framework for displaying MySQL data. It is very easy to learn and use. Currently though it has no print.css to clean up the data when you wish to print. This style will do that for you. It will also eliminate the Firefox error that causes only the first page and last footer to be printed, with nothing in-between.

Enjoy,
Thank you kindly.
