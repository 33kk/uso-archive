### Description
Credit to 4reeeal for the original 2009 ROBLOX style (https://userstyles.org/styles/122867/roblox-2009) and is compatible with the "Vote For Builderman" banner (https://userstyles.org/styles/126083/roblox-2008-builderman-for-president)

RIP Tix.

This design brings back the classic 2008 layout that many people first logged in to see. This iconic design was a icon of old ROBLOX and many users beg the admins to bring back this layout.
