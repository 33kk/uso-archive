### Description
This theme was made for RockyRoadSmith, but I suppose you can use it too if you want.
The theme features red and black colors as well as the characters Iris and Rocky. 

Note:
Best when zoomed in at 110%, might change to 100% [based on what Rocky thinks]
Member cards are affected, colored Red and scratch out the current highest to Iris.
