### Description
Credit goes to equinox, who I assume made the style in the first place - but as he has no updated it in a while I felt it was more than overdue.

Something Awful forum black with a dark color scheme. Ads were removed. Fonts were changed to Calibri/Consolas. If I've missed anything please let me know.
