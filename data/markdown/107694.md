### Description
It's probably just me but Amazon is too wide for my non-widescreen (square shaped) 17 inch monitor, which means a horizontal scroll-bar appears on most Amazon pages for no real reason. Maybe I should set my monitor to a higher pixel ratio but I don't want to.

This simple style merely makes Amazon fit on your screen, <a href="https://twitter.com/2045singularity/status/538252374591430656" target="_blank"><u>without a horizontal scroll bar</a></u>. The scroll bar is superfluous, it doesn't really show any extra info except some blank space, so good riddance.

I think the Amazon site (CSS) is badly designed.

<b>This style applies to all Amazon sites around the world.<b>
