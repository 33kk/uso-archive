### Description
This is a dark grey / black theme for DuckDuckGo with green highlights. It provides an alternative to the default orange / black theme with subtle visual improvements. DuckDuckGo appearance settings and customizations can be saved with a cookie, bookmarklet, or cloud storage. However, none of these were options for me as I have my browser set to clear all cookies, LocalStorage, and site settings when it is closed. This prevented me from being able to save any site settings with DuckDuckGo. By utilizing a userstyle, I am able able to keep my desired security settings and achieve the visual customization I desire. If you're security conscious like me, or just desire an improved alternative to the default themes, give this a try.
