### Description
This blurs all elements on the screen so that people can't read over your shoulder - elements unblur on hover.
This allows me to use WhatsApp Web at work without worrying that passersby will see anything they shouldn't.
Not tested for compatibility with any other WhatsApp Web styles, but I imagine it should play nice.
