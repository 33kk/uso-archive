### Description
This style is for the ServiceNow platform and will re-style the user interface with a dark theme that matches the look used from Geneva onwards.

As ServiceNow has become a vast platform there is no way that this can be tested for all use-cases, so please let me know if there is a specific area I'm missing and I'll see what I can do.
