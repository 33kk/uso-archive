### Description
This is not an identical copy of Dreamwidth's look but a somewhat similar one intended to transform InsaneJournal's outdated early 2000s look into something more modern. Feel free to edit the code and colours or whatever as much or as little as you please. I'm not a pro at this, I simply tinker. If you can improve upon it, please do so. (And then tell me about it!)

For optimal prettiness, use in conjuction with the InsaneJournal <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/16795/insanejournal-simple-icons-images-skin">Simple Icons Skin</a>!

Please note this script will ONLY work with the "Monodramatic (Dropdown)" siteskin.
