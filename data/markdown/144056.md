### Description
Update 1/17/2019: initial support for the redesigned home page; this will probably break but I'll try to keep it updated

On 6/16/2017, twitter made everything all circular; avatars are within circles, buttons and text entry fields have extremely rounded edges, etc. This style changes it to slight rounded corners, reminiscent of how Twitter was only one day before.
