### Description
Not crazy about the Genesis fan forum's style choices and dismayed by the inability to hide people's signatures, so I created a stylesheet to clean it up a little.

- new light and low-contrast background based on Genesis's "The Hits" artwork
- hid signatures
- avatar boxes are left justified
- hid weird unnecessary banners and Conforum advertisements

These are based on my personal preferences. Feel free to modify and come up with your own.
