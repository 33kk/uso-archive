### Description
An unoriginal dark theme for <a href="gw2raidar.com">gw2raidar.com</a>. Theme is based off from <a href="bootswatch.com/darkly">bootswatch.com/darkly</a> because I have no originality. Numbers might be difficult to read. There's not much I can do about it because all the scripted colors for the bar graphs makes it difficult to get a good readable color on a dark themed background, but I tried.
