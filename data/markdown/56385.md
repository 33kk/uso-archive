### Description
V2 rel DEC/30/2011 - This is version two of "Ivar's Translucent Firefox - Clear Minimalism".  This is a conglomeration of my work and lots of UserStyles that I have enjoyed and still use.  I hacked my collection into one page, never thinking I'd be sharing. I cut & paste in lieu of installation from UserStyles and don't recall where credits are due but if you see something here that you authored, please contact me so I can remedy the situation.

I try to keep distraction by my interfaces to a minimum and without advertisement; simplicity, functionality and usability with the hope of elegance.  I've always found translucency Ã¦sthetically pleasing due to the interplay between light and color.

Pinned tabs can be a problem if there are too many opened tabs (see "More Info"), which are 'invisible' on the left (if you hover over them, the popup will tell you what tab it is).
