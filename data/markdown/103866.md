### Description
Some personalized (and probably opinionated) tweaks to Memrise for learning Japanese. Use Japanese (not default Chinese) fonts. Make the questions in a bigger font, and put a huge gap between the questions and answers (avoid contamination with multiple-choice). Inspired by ShadowDrgn's contribution from 2012.
