### Description
This just removes the yellowish banner in G.images...
 
 But does not work well, if at all :(

 BUT here's a faster fix, no .css innvolved.

 Just reset Google's filter to "none" - if set @ moderate or strict.
 Voila! top suggested links & the ugly yellow surround will be gone.
 It appears that google has "gbv=2" in the url (get by voice) in mod.
 & strict filters. It works :)  
 Thanks to those that gave this a try.

  (Do not bother with the code below)
