### Description
UPDATE: Oncourse changed their layout for Summer 1 '09, so this style will make the whole thing seriously unusable.  I'll try to update it sometime soon.

Gets rid of some of the useless elements in Oncourse (https://oncourse.iu.edu/), moves some things around, changes colors, etc.  Please report bugs as you find them :-)

v0.1:
* Header: gets rid of the "Indiana University" header at the very top.  Moves the search, contact us, and logout links to the bottom-right of the page.  Clicking "search" will bring the search options up to the left of the bar (at the bottom).
* Course tabs: extends the course tabs bar across the entire browser and makes the font a bit smaller so it's more likely that all your courses will fit on one line
* Tools sidebar: makes the background white, inverts the header to make it black text on white, gives the links a red hue, highlights the current tool with a black background, adds a black right-border to separate it from the main content area
* Content: adds a slight gray dashed border between table rows
* Graphics: adds icons for .docx, .pptx, and .7z files in the Resources tool and tools that allow attachments.  Changes the open/closed folder icons to sleek black icons

To do:
* Graphics: add support for .xlsx and other "unsupported" files.  Recommendations for specific file types and icons are welcome.
* Graphics: remove inaccurate instances of closed black folder in certain tools' breadcrumbs
