### Description
ubuntuforums.org blue, and easy on the eyes.

UPDATE 9/26/07: Tweaked a few things, and swapped a few more images.

!!!NOTE!!!:  Code is too long, so I've uploaded it in two parts.  After loading into Stylish, remove the brace just before the "cut point", add the second piece of code, and remove the first 3 lines of it.

Second piece: http://userstyles.org/styles/3595
