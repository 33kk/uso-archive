### Description
LiveJournal e-mails new comment notifications that include a quote of the original post or replied-to message. If the post or message is long, scrolling past it to get at the new comment is annoying. 

This script makes the quoted part small with scrollbars.

It should work in any webmail client that preserves the HTML of the notifications. Tested in SquirrelMail and Gmail.
