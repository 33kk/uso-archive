### Description
This style makes some readability changes to the Mozillazine site.  It also changes the fonts so it looks more pleasant on Windows systems that don't offer clear type fonts (i.e. pre-XP).  The changes are:

- changes all fonts (except when a post quotes another post) to 10pt arial
- changes <code> to monospace font
- increases line spacing
- underlines all links
- changes the colour of links when the cursor hovers above them

Very minor update 2006-12-29:

- increased quote box font size to 10pt.  Originally felt that quotes simply looked better in 8pt,  but agree that 10pt is better.  Thanks to Valacar for the feedback
- changed front page, main navigation bar hover colour to white instead of black (looks better on a dark green background)
