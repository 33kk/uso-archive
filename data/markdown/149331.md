### Description
As the name suggests, this redesigns scrollbars (and buttons, optionally) to look like Google Chrome's <b>Glossy Blue</b> theme. I made this as that's usually my theme and it makes them blend in!

### Update notes
Optionally, buttons can be styled! This is disabled by default as websites like Google Maps and YouTube look weird with them modfied.
