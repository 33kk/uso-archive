### Description
A pretty black and green layouit for TV Tropes ( http://tvtropes.org ), the website almost everyone who visits seems to spend hours and hours reading. ;P

Like with some of my other styles, feel free to change the colors. :) I just prefer black and green, harhar.

I've also made the spoiler tags a dark grey, and if you've got a certain resolution, you can read it. But if you want to see them, change their color to #FFF, if you -don't- want to see them at all, change their color to #000 (Or if you changed the background color, change it to whatever that is :P), or change it to some other color.

_SCREENSHOTS_
Coming soon...
