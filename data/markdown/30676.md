### Description
Same style as style 27436 but with a Male background.

Preview here: http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/7976/darkmale.png

Works with all boards on Pawsru.org and 4chan.org.

Due to the image size of the background it works best with screen resolutions of 1680x1050 and larger. Tested on 1920x1080 and 1680x1050.
If you want to use it on a smaller screen simply download and re-size this image to something that's more appropriate. ( http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/476/ransomretrostandwip.jpg )
Then replace the url in the line "background-image:url('http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/476/ransomretrostandwip.jpg') !important;" with your re-sized image.

Once again, I also made a Female Furry theme that looks almost exactly like this one, which is located here style 27436
