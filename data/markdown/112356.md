### Description
• Assign 12 custom tag colors to 12 unique tag names
• Works with "#" and "@" WorkFlowy tags
• Replace "Tag_xx" below with the tag of your choice.
• Select a color. Repeat.

See Notes below for important additional information.

### Update notes
• For unused slots, leave "Tag_xx" in place or you will get an error at install.
• Do not include any spaces.
• This method is case sensitive, while WorkFlowy is not.  Workflowy treats #Due and #due the same. To fix this, create 2 entries or edit your tags in WorkFlowy.
• If another user style is conflicting with your custom tag colors, edit the ".contentTag" code in the conflicting style by removing "!important" next to "color".

Get some "wildcard" capability as follows:
• "#due" will color any tag that <i>starts</i> with that string: #due, #dues, and #due-15-04-15, but not #isdue or @due
• "due" (no tag character) will color any tag that <i>contains</i> that string: #due, @due, #this_is_due, @dues
• "#" (alone) will color all # tags.
• Order matters. The higher tag number will take precedent. If you set "#" to blue for the first entry, and follow with #due set to red, all # tags will be blue except for red #due tags. Set your "global" colors first.
