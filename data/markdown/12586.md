### Description
The progress bar in Fission become animated when loading (like Mac/Ubuntu)

Firefox 3.x only 

for Tab Mix Plus, please go style 12590

- I am really sorry that my style is not work some users, so I upload 2 GIF versions for them to use it. 
However, I am REALLY NECESSARY to know what means of "doesn't work" ... is it means the image not animated? or whole style not work ,or CSS error... if I don't know what is the problem then I cannot adjust it

- I have uploaded the APNG for test, if your bowser does support APNG, then the image will not animated. 
- If you are using firefox 3 and it still not animated, please tell me the config (OS, fx version, any addons/CSS progress bar related) and I will try to fix it
... OR just use the GIF version and leave it not work
style 14653
style 14651

Sorry again that my bad tone and bad English
-------------------------------------------------------
version 0.1.8:
change nothing! just the name and I will post the GIF version for some Firefox that not support APNG

version 0.1.7:
by user 18532 suggestion, I change "#urlbar[fission="fusion"] > #statusbar-icon > .progress-bar{ ..."
to "#urlbar[fission="fusion"] > #statusbar-icon .progress-bar{-moz-appearance: none !important; ..."
both tested in Windows Vista and also work for me, if still cannot work, please tell me

version 0.1.6:
correct the incorrect link for customize ("chrome://browser/content/web-panels.xul" ->  "chrome://browser/skin/urlbar-favicon-glow.png")

version 0.1.5:
can change the color of progress bar FROM the Options of Fission (by default)

-------------------------------------------------------

To okonotrop:

- Have you already install the Fisson (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951) ?
- can Fisson works without install my style?
- Also what is your config of Fisson?

my setting:
Fisson version: 1.0.3 (1.0.2 also works)

Color: default
Image URL: none

Address Bar Features:
F Progress bar at the right of the address bar (ar... MUST be F, as default setting)
F Connection status at the right of the address bar (both T/F works)
T Active link/mouse-over link in the address bar (both T/F works)

- Also I tried to enable/disable the Locationbar^2, it also works

- Do you have any add-ons or styles Fisson related? if so, please tell me and I will modify it
