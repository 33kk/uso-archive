### Description
Problem: If noscript in ff3 (tested on win and lin) is disallowing all javascript, the site navigation in container #menu becomes irrepsonsive.

Solution Attempt: Since fading in the site navigation involves loads of javascript wizardry, the easiest solution I have found is to make the #menu un-floating which lets it become a new row between the title and the main content. I centered the link anchors inside instead of blocking them per line and added a .25em margin around the donation image. The splash area and intro paragraph are expanded to full width to fill the gap.
