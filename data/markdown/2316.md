### Description
I did this partly because I want some privacy when on reddit and partly because I wanted to see more headlines on the page. It also helps remove bias when voting (I vote on the merits of the headline and article not the user.)

- Removes ads, the logo, up and down mod toggles (assuming you open links in a frame you can still vote on the article.) 
- Removes all article data except headline
- Reduces the opacity of modded arrows for articles you've voted to 40%. 
- Removes most styling, leaving links with a simple hover styling
- Lowers contrast of color to a black on white with a light shade of blue for high lighting.
