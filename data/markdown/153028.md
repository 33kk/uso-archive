### Description
A theme that I originally revamped for Pokémon Online (http://pokemon-online.eu/threads/28162/) but have ported over to Pokémon Showdown.

*Added some tweaks from Pedro J. Miranda's theme as I really like the effects he added to the Default Pokémon Showdown*

### Update notes
Make sure you have the Stylish extension installed for your browser...
