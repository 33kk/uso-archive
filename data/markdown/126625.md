### Description
A light-weight Firefox theme for Windows 10 that doesn't suck.

### Update notes
I wasn't satisfied with any of the Win10 Firefox themes out there, so I took what I liked from a few and put them all together. This theme's css is light-weight, simple, and straightforward.

*Additional Information*

This theme requires the latest Firefox version, and that you disable Firefox's native titlebar through the "Customizations" option of the Firefox menu.

The tab-bar is white by default, however it can be set to any color desired or transparent to match your Windows 10 color palette (if you've enabled colored titlebars within your Windows 10 color options). You might have to edit the tab text color depending on what color you've chosen.
