### Description
Keeps <a href="http://www.gog.com">GOG.com's</a> main nav-bar at the top and prevents it from following you down pages as you browse.

Fully compatible with <a href="http://www.gog.com/forum/general/barefoot_essentials_2_gogcom_enhancement/page1">Barefoot Essentials</a>.

### Update notes
Inspired by <b><a href="http://userstyles.org/users/123153">Raina's</a></b> now-defunct style, Style 63161, my updated style directly answers <i><a href="http://www.gog.com/wishlist/site/option_to_hide_top_bar">this requested site feature</a></i> on GOG's Wishlist.

Unlike our previous attempts to keep GOG's nav-bar on top of the page, however, this style does not have <i>any</i> known scrolling or page-width issues with either Chrome or Firefox, and should work on any screen.

If you encounter a problem of any kind, however, wish to make a request, or have any feedback whatsoever, I'd love to hear from you.  Click my name above to see how you can contact me.
