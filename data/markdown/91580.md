### Description
<b>This theme is for use with the <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/63573/wikipedia-layout-enhanced">Wikipedia - Layout, enhanced</a> layout and may not display properly on other layouts.</b>

This is my brand-new Firefox-themed Wikipedia skin! It's based off of code from grom's <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/64023/wikipedia-dark-blue-simple">Wikipedia - Dark, blue, simple</a> style. It adds a super-nice wallpaper with Firefox's old (pre-23.0) logo in the upper right-hand corner (credit goes to <a href="http://jb55.deviantart.com">jb55</a> for the background). The theme is designed to make Wikipedia much easier to use while also making it look better. Download it today and try it for yourself!
