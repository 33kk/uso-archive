### Description
A YouTube Player Skin which gives tooltips and menus a frosted glass blur effect. Works with Safari, Edge, Chrome, and Opera. Instructions for use in notes.

### Update notes
<strong><a href="https://github.com/GarethPW/YouTube-Player-Frosted-Glass">Find the source code on GitHub</a></strong>

Safari and Chrome 76+ support this style by default.

Microsoft Edge 42+ (EdgeHTML 17+) supports this style by default. However, you'll need to install it as a userscript instead.

In order to make this style work in Chrome (75 or below) or Opera (62 or below), you must enable the flag, <i>#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</i>:
<ul>
<li>Chrome: <a href="chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features">chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</a>
<li>Opera: <a href="opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features">opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</a>
</ul>
Some versions of Chromium 7x prior to version 76 do not render this effect properly on HiDPI displays.
