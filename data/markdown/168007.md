### Description
The aim of this style is to have a good centralized view in three-column mode. Still, you can enjoy its minimalistic schema in other modes!<br>
<b>p.s.</b> I think heart/like sucks!<br>
<br> <i> " My healing is not in the "heart" of crossroad passengers. Reza Baraheni, Iranian poet"</br></i><br>
So I replaced the "heart" with the old-school fave icon, the legendary "star".
