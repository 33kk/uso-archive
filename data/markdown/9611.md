### Description
Version 0.3.2
2008-08-13

Inspired by style 6403.
All graphics used are original.

This style revamps UserStyles.org with a cool dark tone. It covers the main page, the forums, and the blog. It supports resolutions as low as 800x600. To change this style to fixed-width, find "/*width: 1234px !important;*/" (near the top) and remove the "/*" and "*/" tags and change "1234" to the desired width in pixels. This doesn't work well as a percentage.
