### Description
A theme I made using code from Rhyhex's green theme (I added more code myself, though). The theme is navy blue and includes a background of my building server, Nobelium Town v2.
NOTE: This theme is compatible with everything in the site except Die Mauer. I cannot figure out how to fix the post form's transparency.
