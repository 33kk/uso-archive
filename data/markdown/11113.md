### Description
This is a style for dyslexic people who have problems reading  the web pages they're visiting. It removes practically all formatting elements from a page and leaves it clean and easy to read for dyslexic individuals. 

It was created after following the University of Dublin's Clear Print Guidelines [http://www.tcd.ie/disability/information/accessibility/accessible_information/formats/clear_print.php]. 

The code that was used to highlight links, text areas, text boxes and buttons was taken from the 'Bright Focus (for buttons, links, and textboxes)' style [http://userstyles.org/styles/305] and modified to suit the needs of this global style. 

I will try to constantly update the following code as I browse the web and try to make it as usable as possible. 

I hope you will find it useful and please make sure you leave your feedback, either it's positive or negative. 

Thank you! 

** Update 2011-01-12 : Added support for HTML5 tags.
