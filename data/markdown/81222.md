### Description
Today I fancy Open Sans, so I decided to put it everywhere.
Also cleaned the site up a bit (inspired by reddacted).
Very much WIP.

Note that I don't use RES and have therefore not styled it.
Also please note that I've disabled custom subreddit styles and use compressed reddit (found in options).
If you use other options, the style will probably go bad.
