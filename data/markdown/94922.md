### Description
Some little tweaks I made to Confess.ly's CSS for fun.

### Update notes
Features:
- fading links
- customized scrollbar
- changed some headers a bit
- Made new sidebar chatroom scroll with you (with options to put it on the upper or lower right or left) so that you can see it no matter where you are on the page
- <b>(New!) Optional dark theme, suggested by AutVeniam - select "Dark" on the drop-down</b> - still sort of under construction
- more coming - please send me a suggestion through PM or chat on Confess.ly!

<i>Note</i>: Sidebar chatroom is optimized for higher resolutions. If you have a low resolution, it may cover up parts of the navigation/textboxes. In that case, it may be better to choose a lower right/left (probably lower left) option or turn it off ("None"). To change the option after you're already installed it, refresh this page and grab a different option.
