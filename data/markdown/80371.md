### Description
<p>Allows gmail to shrink to a width of about 500px by hiding the sidebar (gmail button from sidebar is moved to where the google logo is, hover over it to show sidebar!) and making other elements shrink properly.</p>
<p>Plus hides the right sidebar (when viewing a mail) below 1050px.</p>
<p>Plus makes the new compose wider. Not tested with the old compose!</p>
<p>Tested on Firefox 20 on OSX. <b>Only tested with standard theme & compact display density!!!!</b></p>
