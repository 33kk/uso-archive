### Description
This style flattens the overall appearance of the site and hides irrelevant elements. Overall, I believe it provides a very modern and minimal design.

The list of television shows in the sidebar on the right is given an opacity value so that it's darker than the rest of the content, thus putting more emphasis on the video player and comment section.

The huge excess of random <code>br</code> elements are hidden, thus condensing the content.

This style assumes that if you know how to use Stylish, you're already aware of the basic troubleshooting tips provided by Couchtuner and hides those.

Player tabs no longer have a border and are made light grey instead of bright yellow, which is significantly less obnoxious.

The navigation bar fades into the background, again, putting more emphasis on the video player and the comments.

The site's banner and most promotional links are hidden. Ads are not removed. If you want to hide ads, use uBlock.
