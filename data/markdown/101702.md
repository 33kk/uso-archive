### Description
Craigslist forces certain serif typefaces, namely
`"Bitstream Vera Serif","Times New Roman",serif`, but I like my default serif
typeface better. The current goal of this stylesheet is to replace only
the areas of *.craigslist.org which are written in a serif typeface with the
browser's default serif typeface.
