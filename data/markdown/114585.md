### Description
This style closes tabs with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28graphical_user_interfaces%29">hand <b>pointer</b></a>, pointing finger, instead of the default <b>arrow pointer</b>.   

A <b>pointing finger icon</b>, for links, seems best for tab-close buttons. I also applied the hand pointer to bookmarks toolbar, and personal-bookmarks, which considering they're actually links it seems correct. "Help cursor" is implemented in bookmarks menu. 

Hand pointer makes it easier to close tabs. Closing is more focused-precise.

<i>You can easily change my cursors-pointers to any type you desire via the helpful resource list in the code.</i>

You may be interested to note I use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus/">Tab Mix Plus</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/">Classic Theme Restorer</a> <b>for other styling issues</b>, but those addons aren't needed to make this pointer-style work.
