### Description
A simple script to always show the Go-Button on the right side of the Nav-Bar. Tested on Firefox 40.0.3

Works well with many Styles an Addons, such as https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/classic-rsgb/

I found the script on http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=2826209, written by Gingerbread Man, and just wanted to make it available for everyone. Thank you very much!
