2016/08/19 Note:
Oops! Google seems gonna change its style dramatically! Stay tuned for upcoming update!

2016/07/21 Update:
Bug fixes.

2016/07/20 Update:
In response to some users' requests, now you can change Unsplash.com's refresh rate! 

2016/07/13 Update:
Now if you choose Unsplash.com as background, you can use the new option "Keywords" to load the image you prefer. For example, if you input "cat", only the photos with cats will show up.

2016/07/12 Update:
I'm afraid some of your PC's screen resolution might differ from 1920x1080, so I added an option for you to set up.
Otherwise you can just leave it as default.

2016/07/03 Update:
Enhanced the compatibility with Firefox and Opera.

2016/06/17 Update:
Added an option of the top bar's position.

Added an option to toggle text shadow.

2016/06/08 Update:
Big update to Google Images! Get hurry and enjoy the elegant image viewer NOW!

2016/05/31 Update:
Few bug fixes.

2016/05/30 Update:
Fixed the bug in Google maps.

2016/05/29 Update:
Removed the gratuitous change to button.
Fixed the bug of search by image dialog.

2016/05/28 Update:
Added unsplash.com as an alternative random image source to unsplash.it.
Notice the difference between these two: Unsplash.it is a third-party service which has only 1000+ pics manually selected from official Unsplash.com but somewhat more elegant maybe...well, just personal feeling. You could try both of them.

2016/05/27 Update:
Few bug fixes.

2016/05/26 Update:
A nonlinear gradient is now simulated by interpolation. I'm sure the gradient on front page is much better now.
Bug of input element has been killed.

2016/05/25 Update:
Thanks to a third party api, now it supports Bing daily wallpaper! 
And Unsplash random pics as well!
Simply select them in the drop-down setting!

2016/05/24 Update:
Slight adjustment of the gradient to make it look more smooth.

2016/05/23 Update:
Fixed the search bar and text shadow for Asian characters.
