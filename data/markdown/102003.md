### Description
Bring Sonic to your YouTube videos with this custom video progress bar! Animated Sonic leaves a blue shiny trail behind him as he gallops faster than ever!

<mark><b>This style only works on YouTube videos supporting the HTML5 video player.</b> You must also have the HTML5 video player enabled on your YouTube account (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5" target="_blank">you can do that here</a>). Please note that <b>not all videos currently support playback in the HTML5 player, so it won't work for every video.</b></mark>
