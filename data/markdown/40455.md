### Description
This style is lightly inspired by style 33672 but is largely improved:

1. Needs less maintenance if YouTube changes it's configuration slightly (hopefully!).
2. The original YouTube Dark used too many dark elements thereby reducing visibility in some circumstances (buttons, menus, etc.).
3. It's completely cross-browser compatible including css border-radius/box-shadow tags for for each browser that supports such tags.

Keeping this style up-to-date takes a lot of work! Showing your support would go a long way in keeping me motivated.
