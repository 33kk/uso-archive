### Description
This style is designed to optimize the layout of the Firefox theme SIT - originally created in order to match the Aero interface of Windows Vista and 7.

I optimize the code for the use of the three most commonly used buttons like Home, Downloads and Bookmarks. Hope you enjoy.


Important:
Open the code and look for a place where it says the following:

/* margins on sides of tabs toolbar while in titlebar */
#toolbar-menubar[autohide="true"] ~ #TabsToolbar[tabsontop="true"] {
     margin-left: 135px !important;
     margin-right: 110px !important;
}

Along these lines, the number of pixels in bold refers to the buttons on CustomTitlebar. Each button is equivalent to 30 pixels, then just add or decrease according to the number of buttons that are there.

Notes:
Sorry for wrong English ... I am Brazilian and I used Google Translate.

Thanks for Xeviousss for this great theme for Firefox.
