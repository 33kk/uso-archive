### Description
I was dissapointed on my 1900 x 1200 display that the new changes to Trademe (March 2009) made the body text (main text area of an auction listing) look far too small to read in comparison with the way it used to be.

Yes you can Ctrl + to make text bigger, but TM made the listing area text smaller, so if you make that text bigger, it makes the menus etc huge.

All this contribution does is to change the font size of the body area. That's all, nothing else.

Hope it helps some members that don't like the tiny text.

Cheers
