### Description
google looks so great without it.

enable compact mode in gmail, google reader & calendar before enabling style

may not work in all setups, works in chrome

note to google:  do this at least for those on ChromeOS.. the black bar takes away from the app look/feel (as soon as i see it, or any nav bar like it, i immediately think website.

without it glaring at me, i often forget that gmail, drive, reader, etc. are websites.

DO IT DO IT NOW
