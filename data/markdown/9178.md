### Description
Here's a light blue GameFAQs css. I used it for years but I just took the trouble to update the damn thing to v10.

Credits have to go to : 
Dark Blue GameFAQs - Charizard06 : http://www.mediafire.com/?ztj9xwszdmz ... helped me figure out how to change the default board colors and login.
The bundled "Wide Default Layout" CSS. Helped a lot, thanks.
The bundled "GFCode" by Ant. P. Very neat features in there. Just had to change the colors though!
The bundled "Standard Default" by GameFOX devs to update my CSS from gfaqs9 to gfaqs10.
