### Description
The upper fold of the new design is very messy, so I cleaned it up, and also removed the redundant top story box above the main blog stories. I only removed the ads that were in-between the story summaries and in the header, not the ones in the right column. I also changed the main story fonts back to Arial/Sans-serif instead of Times New Roman.
