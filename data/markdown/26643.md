### Description
The Separe addon for Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1945) is an addon that highlights blank tabs such that they can serve as simple dividers between groups of tabs, e.g. between work and leisure, you could put a blank tab.

The addon is no longer supported, and a few Stylish replacements have been made including http://userstyles.org/styles/2033 and http://userstyles.org/styles/1615.

I use the tree-style tab addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5890) which stacks tabs vertically, but neither of the Stylish Separe replacements interacted well with the vertically-oriented tabs.  So I modded one of them so it works with the vertical tabs.  I don't know anything about CSS, so it was literally trial and error, and as such, I can't make any guarantees it will work on your system, but it does work for me...  My changes are trivial, so all credit to the previous authors.
