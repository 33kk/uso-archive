### Description
This is a dark style for 20minutos.es, it mimics my other styles. It's oriented for those that read the news via RSS, all the navigation bars have been removed, there's no adds, no spam, no 50-lines-long-footer with links, etc.

Those that like the style but miss some of these elements will find comments at the end of the css file with instructions on how to re-enable these. However, these are not themed, and won't ever be. I don't use them so... However, you are free to take this as a starting point for a more complete theme, if you wish.
