### Description
Subtly tweaks visual indicators for the Container Tabs experiment currently available in Beta, Dev, and Nightly.

### Update notes
Note: This style is currently only made to work with the default Australis UI. It should play nice with lightweight themes, but complete themes are another story. For compatibility with a particular theme, feel free to start a discussion!
