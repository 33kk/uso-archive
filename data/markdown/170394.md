### Description
!! This style is not supported by author anymore, so it's really low chance to get any updates. Modify and release it by yourself if you want. !!

Many students are spending much time on this site. We all know how long it takes to completely be sure in yourself to pass the exam with maximum res. Finish task after task, test after test again'n'again. Eyes can't bear that blinding white color for a long time. It's uncomfortable to read. And here it comes. The Dark Theme. The savior for your eyes!

### Update notes
!! This style is not supported by author anymore, so it's really low chance to get any updates. Modify and release it by yourself if you want. !!

You can also change colors if you want. All of them in a separate block, that's makes it easier to change for yourself.

If you spot a bag, it will be nice of you to report me about it. :)
