### Description
A dark theme for Google Plus. The design is inspired by vaaski's theme "YouTube Dark FADE".

[[Notice. This has some bugs, but I have no motivation to fix them as I don't use Google Plus anymore. You are allowed to copy this style, and (if you're an awesome person) continue to keep it alive and up-to-date! I'll repay you with my infinite gratitude.]]
