### Description
History
- v1.0 added on May 20th 2010


Simple code tweak to allow zoom-in to fullsize when you click on the resized artwork.  

Notes:
- You'll only see the thumbnail while the full image is loading.
- The super-browse thumbnails don't always show up.
- If you want to remove the super-browse arrows and the show all button, the code is included but commented out.

If anyone wants to expand on this, go for it.
