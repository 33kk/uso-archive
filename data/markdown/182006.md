Consider supporting me by donating on <a href="paypal.me/giorgioadamo"><b>Paypal</b></a>

Even just a coffee worth donation for the staggering amount of hours spent to fix it every time WhatsApp decides to deliver a new version, would be super appreciated!
Ooooor... just <b>send me a message / mail at rwndeloused@gmail.com</b> to share your feedback / appreciation. That means a lot to me!

N.B.: I suggest uncommenting the line of code below in your Stylish code editor to be able to import the Raleway font. It's unfortunately not allowed to me to publish the skin including external urls for safety reasons.

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway");
