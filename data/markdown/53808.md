### Description
Alpha (first release)
This theme simulates bungie.net before it was updated to a darker space theme. There ARE problems with this theme, such as the footer not working as it used to, as well as certain pages on bungie.net adopting the old background when they're supposed to have a unique one (for example, the Crimson project page). No idea whether these will be fixed as they seem to be minor problems at the moment. I guess it depends on the popularity of the theme.

Enjoy!
