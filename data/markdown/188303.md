### Description
Applies Paul Suvada's Rainbow Chess colouring to pieces on Lichess. Due to using filters, it will apply to any piece style, although certain sets can make pieces (mainly knights and kings) hard to distinguish, especially if they use a lot of grey

### Update notes
If you wish to alter the colours, use the tool at https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp to generate filter combinations from a hex colour
