### Description
Requires the user to read the comments in the code.

This CSS is packed with selectors, and by default, hides those objects.

<b>How to use:</b> If you want to restore a particular object, then delete the code - it's either a line, or a small block of text.

<b>Important:</b> I strongly suggest you save your customizations in a new style, otherwise your edits will be undone if you download an update.
