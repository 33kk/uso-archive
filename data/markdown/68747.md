### Description
Adds a neat auto-hide effect for the bookmarks toolbar that hovers over the page content instead of pushing it down. Also replaces the bookmark item's default rollover and hover states and tweaks the vertical spacing between them.

Works and looks best on Windows with Firefox 12 or higher. I have created a separate CSS for Mac users.

### Update notes
Version 1.0.0 - 7/04/12 - Initial version (Happy America Day!)
Version 1.0.1 - 7/06/12 - tweaked padding around bookmark items and toolbar animation speed.
Version 1.0.2 - 7/07/12 - now working for users who show always display the Menu Bar.
Version 1.0.3 - 7/16/12 - fixed bug that caused bookmarks toolbar to appear when not directly over the navbar.
