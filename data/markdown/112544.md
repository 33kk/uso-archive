### Update notes
I use Jira in my day job. It very good famous and extensible bug tracker. But even I use wide monitor additionally to notebook their design seems to me very sprawling.

That style was born several month when I tried there and there reduce elements and spaces between, move description right, highlight title and key fields like status…

100 words have worth less than example looks (for simplicity and easy distinguishing I will show screenshots of original Jira in Firefox and in Chromium with that style applied)
