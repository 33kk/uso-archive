### Description
This (hopefully) unique skin is something I made in my free time to practice, and it features a (not very unique) dark colour palette, contrasted with bold fonts and unnecessarily large buttons in battles as well as different backgrounds from XY and ORAS and animated weather. This skin is constantly in the works (and is probably buggy), and if you have any suggestions, questions, bug reports or criticism, feel free to let me know on Showdown or on Smogon!

Shoutout to Doubles room and meta for being cool.


<b>If you have any bug reports or questions, please message me at 13ulbasaur on either Smogon or Pokemon Showdown. I do not get any notifications when I get messages here and I rarely check this site except to update my style so I rarely see messages until a long time.</b>
