### Description
Want to Carrot at work or confuse yourself? Now you can make Carrot look like Slack's Aubergine theme! (Plus some small UI improvements)

### Update notes
Choose your options from the list above. To grab a new version, refresh the page and choose your new options. 

Full width - expand carrot to the full width of your screen, like Slack.

Full height w/no header - expand Carrot to the full height of your screen - takes away the navigation bar/header and instead lets opens up the space for more lines of chat!

Preview includes full-width option only (will add screenshots for other options in the future).
