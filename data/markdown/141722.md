### Description
The original Brick-Hill seasonal themes (Summer and Winter).

Note: The Summer style is still accessible by using inspect element (along with an extra autumn theme I haven't uploaded), I just uploaded it for the sake of simplicity and in case it's removed from the site later on.

### Update notes
•4/24/17 - Created Style w/ Summer theme
•4/24/17 - Added Winter theme
•4/30/17 - Added a screenshot (I would add more; however, the 200KB limit is a pain)
•5/31/17 - Changed the blue areas (such as the navbar) of the summer theme to their correct color

•To pick between the Winter or Summer theme, click Advanced Style Settings under the description.
