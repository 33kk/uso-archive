### Description
This style basically makes the bans page look a bit like the Desteria store. It gets rid of the nasty looking gaps around the navigation removes a few borders on table headers and a few other little slice of life things. I haven't changed the default color of the tables because the white looks fine to me but you can easily change it if you wish.
