### Description
This style is designed to allow the .maincontbox (and it`s equivalents) to span across the entire screen width, rather than wasting the space on the right-hand side of the screen. The first line (removing line breaks) was lifted from style 1739 to reduce the number of styles I use. As well, the color scheme is changed to be easier to look at for extended periods.
There is definitely some unneeded code in this, as several approaches were tried before finding something that worked. 

Thanks to user 7765 for the original suggestion which got me working on this.
