### Description
Based on "Slashdot - use whole screen width, bigger font" with various adjustments for more optimal mobile viewing.  New and improved to remove the "new and improved" DICE additions such as inline polls and Video Bytes sections!

More new, more improved!  Removes some post-DICE junk.  Sorry Whipslash, I'mma let you finish but ur site is real ugly.

    + Add rule to remove annoying new sponsored ad "stories"
    + Remove social bar sharing junk
    + Misc. cleanup
* 2015-06-04:

    + Also fixed issue with the story divs on the home page not filling browser width.
* 2015-06-06: 
    + Fix header line-height making story titles jam together on Firefox (mobile).
    + Hide topic icon on small screens.
* 2015-08-22:
    + Hide topic icon on all screens, it's dumb anyway.
    + Remove the ugly comment chat bubble thing from # comments display
    + Add [] on either side of # comments on story list to help differentiate it from the story title
    + Removed the silly red beaker thing that doesn't seem to do anything, unless you're the rare duck indeed who messes around with the firehose.
    +
