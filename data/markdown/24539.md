### Description
~Friday March 5th, 2010
Edit: The shoutbox on the chat page of deviantART was appearing a bit strangely, so I went in and fixed it. 

~Saturday January 30th, 2010
Edit: Made the shoutboxes more symmetrical. Also, I wasn't aware that there was a similar (much nicer looking) dA shoutbox style on here. I didn't steal, you can check my inferior CSS capabilities for proof of that. XD I apologize nonetheless.

~Friday January 29th, 2010
Edit: Fixed the Z-Index on the Avatars so they didn't overshadow the Edit Page function.

~Sunday January 24th, 2010
Instead of the list that deviantART has set up with their shoutbox where it's hard to distinguish who's talking and where the message ends, I redesigned it to separate each comment in it's own space, then separated and discolored the timestamp at the base of each comment. It only makes the shoutbox slightly larger, and doesn't really make an impact on deviantART's already bulky profile pages. It works on both the profile page and the journal page. 

If you have any problems with the style, feel free to note me on my deviantART account ( http://artehpants.deviantart.com/ ), or make a comment on the Rounded Shoutbox ( http://artehpants.deviantart.com/art/Rounded-Shoutbox-151625812 ) submission. Also, if you want to edit and repost this userstyle elsewhere, you must ask permission. Thanks very much for your interest. ^^

The preview is on my deviantART submission since UserStyles does not allow jpeg and the after image is too large.
