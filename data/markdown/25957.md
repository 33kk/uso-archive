### Description
Created by Justin B
Created on 3/6/10

This is an update to: http://userstyles.org/styles/25956 
This style redesigns the 'secret admire' page of the matchmaker.

Leave a comment if you find any bugs.
I know that the remaining guesses isn't visible. It has to do with my MyYearbook clean up style.

***If you would like a homepage dark theme, that will match the 'matchmaker' then leave a comment and let me know.***
