### Description
(This style has been rolled into my updated version of Ultra Minimalist UI, rendering a separate style unnecessary. You can get it here: style 59377)

This is an adaptation of style 12864 meant to be used in conjunction with my other style, style 35018.

It further slims down the navigation and tab bars, and curves the bottom corners of tabs into a pleasing, streamlined shape.

When installed together with style 35018, it reduces the combined height of the navigation and tab bars by about a third, leaving you with more screen real estate.
