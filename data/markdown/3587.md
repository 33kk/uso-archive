### Description

Do I really need to explain to you what Newegg.com is? If so, you should go there and find out what it is. Again, this style was written to compliment the NASA Night Launch theme. The link for that theme is posted in this style. Go there and check it out. If you don't like it, you probably won't like this either.

This style is for people who don't need explanations as why someone would use a dark browser interface. If you're not one of those people, don't bother installing this style.

Newegg.com and Eggxpert.com are both handled by this style.
