### Description
A Black style with an additional accent colour for WA.
Note that the default pink is the exclusive YouPorn pink.
Also recommended is this kinda cherry pink: #c4254a (personal favorite).

### Update notes
Based on 
Dark-Orange (JM-Skin) (Web Whatsapp Skin)
and
WA-Web - Dark Skin [V.3.0][by SKIN-FACTORY] 

I mixed them and liked what came out so I started to develop my own style out of it, but as this is mostly not my work I give credit to the original creators here and hope they like what I made out of it.

Over time I work on this style to improve it, remove mistakes done by the original creators and also keep it up-to-date as there are always things that are added to WA-online. I use it every day, therefore updates are rather quick.

NOTE: The "updated" part is deprecated, to get your emoji area in the correct color take this userstyle addon: https://userstyles.org/styles/122069/wa-web-emoticon-extension-by-skin-factory
this will give you the little emojis back like you like them.

Sorry that it took so long guys, enjoy!
