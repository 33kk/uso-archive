### Description
Often in forums someone quotes a post that already contains a quote, resulting in extremely large quote boxes. This style deletes quotes within quotes. It leaves the top of the quote box behind so you know that there was a quote there (furthermore, you can use the snapback link to read the quote if you really want it).
