### Description
Roblox.com modified to something less... white. Includes tweaks I make to better my browsing experience.

### Update notes
<b>update:</b> removed force sidebar option for now.

Improved may be subjective, but I like it for the most part...

It's not a complete overhaul, but it does tie together some of the old and new website together with a consistent gray background along with various other tweaks. I may have missed a few pages, so if something looks off just send me a message. In the future I may create a dark version for night browsing, but that could be a bit of an undertaking between styling everything and design choices.

This is built off my other style <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/114128/roblox-landing">Roblox Landing</a>
