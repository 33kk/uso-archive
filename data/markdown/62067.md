### Description
More user styles by me: http://userstyles.dreamflame.in/
--------
Firefox doesn't support/use that download manager window anymore by default.
Sorry, this style is not maintained anymore. You might want to take a look at <a title="Noisy Navy Firefox UI by hkr" href="http://userstyles.org/styles/95220/noisy-navy-firefox-ui-by-hkr">this</a>. I bet you're gonna like it :)

Download Manager made prettier
State-specific color on downloads as well :)
