### Description
This is a full-site user style that aims to pretty up all sections of Craigslist.  I attempted to address every detail of the site, in order to provide a more legible and aesthetically pleasing experience.  At the same time, I preserved much of the basic style of Craigslist.  Don't expect anything too radical.  It's still gray/white background, blue links.

* Default font is changed from the browser-default of Times New Roman to Helvetica Neue/Arial.
* Extra spacing and a greater leading has been added for better legibility.
* Front landing pages have been tidied up and is now presented in three columns.  All those tiny blocks are gone.
* Perhaps the biggest difference is that Table-of-Contents and Listing pages are now only 700px wide.  This setting greatly improves legibility for long blocks of text.  However, any listings that employ in-line styling with a custom width might have content that extends outside the new skinnier width.
