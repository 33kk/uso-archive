Tumblr dashboard theme, with custom 'new post' icons.

"<i>The earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 4th or 5th century; the recipe gives it no special name, just Aliter Dulcia 'another sweet dish'. There is a 14th-century German recipe under the name "Arme Ritter" (German for "poor knights"). "Poor knights" is also the name for French toast in Sweden, Norway and Finland. There are 15th-century English recipes for "pain perdu" (French for "lost [or wasted] bread", suggesting that the dish is a use for bread which has gone stale).</i>" <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_toast#Etymology">*</a></sup>
