### Description
Auto-hide the page header, <s>page footer,</s> and article sidebar. Each is reduced to a thin placeholder (at the top, bottom, and left edge of the page, respectively) that expands and floats over the body of the article when the mouse hovers over it.

<s>The article now fills the width of the browser, no matter the size of the browser window. Comments are suppressed, as are social networking links within the article text. The "tools" menu (Print, Font size, etc.) also auto-hides, collapsing to the ABC icon.</s> (Well, maybe, but so much has broken I expect that's all broken too.)
