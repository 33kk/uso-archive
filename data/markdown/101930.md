### Description
This userstyle removes the background from unselected and pinned tabs and adds the thin separators from the default Australis theme.  Hovering over unselected tabs will display a soft, red gradient background.  This userstyle also changes the new tab button to a plus sign.

<b>This userstyle is designed to be used with the FXChrome theme only.  Not only will it probably look weird on the default theme, but using it with the default theme would be kind of counterproductive, don't you think? ;)</b>
