### Description
Just another simple script thanks to help on the forums.  I'll update the image every once in a while to change the logo for ya.  ;)

Does exactly what the title says.  It changes the dA logo in the top-left of the screen to something a little more "stylish."

I'm not gonna post screenshots because it's too much work to update every time I change the picture...
