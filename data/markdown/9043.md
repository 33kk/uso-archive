### Description
Keep the Tabs Bar Size to a Readable Minimum Size.   The purpose of a browser is to read web content not to lose valuable real estate for content you already know what it says.   Along the lines of providing more space see my other styles as well.  See Notes below for more information including Firefox 29 disaster remediation.
