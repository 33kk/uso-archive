### Description
This script keeps the Battlelog "userbar" fixed to the top of the window. No matter where you scroll on the page, no matter where you are in Battlelog, it will remain visible.

### Update notes
Also does the following (most users won't notice): 

-Replaces an image in favor of dynamic transparent color (RGBa) (faster browser loading/rendering). 

-Pushes down Battlelog's main header to leave room at the top so the user header doesn't overlap.

-Written for the /r/battlefield3 community.
