### Description
************READ THIS COMPLETELY********UPDATED 3-23-08- but STILL READ!!--  The style I used has too many characters to upload- so I put it up on some space I have- the URL is HERE:  

The code for this is HERE:

http://cdrs.us/RedShiftGoogle.txt 


This is an edited version of someone else's dark gray theme (I'm not sure who I think "oltra" - I can't find it now) to go with RED SHIFT theme extension in firefox.  I did nothing other than edit font  and other misc colors- so I get no credit.  

Looks great with the columnar display of results too.

Make sure you remove other references to gray Google redesigns you may have already have in stylish.
ID DOES GIVE YOU AN ERROR when EDITING AND SAVING- BUT IT WORKS 100% FINE with no ill effects- the other guys did too, and his worked fine- I don't know enough about this stuff to stop the error- I've been using it on 4 different computers with no problem whatsoever.

Use with Google gray logo replacement url of that is :  http://userstyles.org/styles/1695

Your buttons would be your regular system buttons- mine just happen to be green.
