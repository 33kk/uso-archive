### Description
I installed All-Glass v2 after Firefox 3.5 came out, and promptly disabled it because of the headache-inducing changes from the original Glasser (like the tabs being nearly invisible, Download Statusbar being completely unreadable, and Stumbleupon sitting there in an island of opaqueness. So, despite knowing nothing about CSS, I fixed it.

Much love for Kálmán Tarnay's Firefox Vista Aero theme for showing me that it's possible for clear tabs to not suck (and a tiny bit of cribbed code =) ), an unknown Japanese hacker's Firefox Navy Vista theme, and Ambroos for actually getting Glasser to work with 3.5.
