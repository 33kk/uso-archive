### Description
Screenshot here: http://ukcmp.com/td/navytrim.jpg
Compare with default here: http://ukcmp.com/td/default.jpg

also, here is a screenshot http://ukcmp.com/td/midnight.jpg of my other toodledo UserStyle (style 52310). It is a comprehensive color scheme that can be used for making other color schemes for the new layout.

This Style, "Navy trim" merely replaces all the light gray on the Tasks page with white and navy. After the new layout was published, the site themes weren't back up for a time, and I read on the forum a couple people that did not like all the light gray, so I made this in a half hour or so after making my other style.

If you use this and like it, tell me! If you like this, but it's broken something on the site, let me know and I will fix it. If you have suggestions for a slightly different version, I might have the time but no promises.
