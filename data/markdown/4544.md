### Description
This is a style made by user 552
I asked for this on the forums and he posted the instructions.
Therefore i don't take any credit fort this.

I'm posting it for anyone who uses labels a lot, and wants them on top of Contacts.

P.S. Depending on how many labels you use, adjust the "margin-top" percentage.
