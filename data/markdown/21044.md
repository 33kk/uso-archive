### Description
So now I can say to myself that I am getting pro in CSS. :P
This is my fourth style and I am feeling great about it.

This style will give www.mydigitallife.info a New Clean, Aesthetic, Decent and OS X Style look.

I have worked a lot on this...And learned something great with this too i.e how to use OSX styling in userstyles.
Thanks for all of your support.

Do donate if you like me to have a coffee after stressful work.
