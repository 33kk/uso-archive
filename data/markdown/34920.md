### Description
**Designed for Google Chrome, I don't think it works for Mozilla Firefox**

This is the first style I've ever made (with with a lot of copypasta from "Into the Depths of Darkness", and "The Best, No Ads, Optimized Space" styles). I will be planning on making more website styles with the same basic look, though I might change the color depending on what people say about it. Oh and If I missed anything please let me know and I will do my best fixing it.

Cleaned up all the ads, and darkened as much as I could ATM. Most borders, text, and buttons are some shade of orange (I only used two shades of orange. A lighter and a darker).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Things I wish I could do/ plan to do:
	-Put the things on the homepage in  the center of the page (need help on that)

	-Change the small icons. ex: download, magnet url, next page/prev page, etc.

	-Rounded corners?? Possible, if I get around to it.

	-Organize the code, if requested.
