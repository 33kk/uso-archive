### Description
With the latest changes happening to Twitter's UI, I thought it'd be best for me to jump the gun and provide us a glimpse of what the future of twitter will look like; no text. I probably missed one or two spots but this removes 99.99% of the text on twitter. I made this for a joke and that's all it should be lmao
