### Description
I made this for use with the excellent Strata40 theme by user 26618 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14284).

For Firefox 3.x only. 
(It has a different effect on 4.0, due to the removal of .tabs-bottom in Firefox 4.0)

Note: Will work with any theme that features tabs that appear to merge with the bar, but Your Mileage May Vary.

> Makes the tabs more "3-D"
> tabs (with style enabled) appear to 'curl' upward from the tab-bar
> adds a slight box-shadow to the tab-bar bottom
