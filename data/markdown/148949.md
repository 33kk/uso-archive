### Description
Collapses Habitica action bars/drawers (on the bottom of the Skills, Equipment, and Stable pages) until hovered over. Also makes them semi-transparent until hovered over so they're less obtrusive. Similar to the Default Collapsed Drawers style, except the other style causes food not to show up on the Stable page.
