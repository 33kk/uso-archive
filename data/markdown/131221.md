### Description
Falcon is an attempt to create a distinctive modernist style digital chess set that doesn’t sacrifice usability. 

The pieces are sharp and simple, highlighting the aggressive nature of the game and projecting the pieces’ particular powers visually. They are fresh, but they draw heavily on the traditional piece forms that players are familiar with. Falcon aims to feel natural to play with after only a handful of matches, while looking beautifully at home in a modern computer’s user interface.
