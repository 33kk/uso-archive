### Description
For some reason Scribblehub kept defaulting back to it's original theme so I took the time to hunt down the individual pages and their dark mode colors. I may have missed a few things with reading list and it's highlighter settings so please don't fault me for that.  I made a few quality of life improvements I believe.  Also I'm just a hobbyist css learning noob so if my coding is poor I'm sorry.  If there is something wrong or missing you can let me know on novelupdates forums under this thread: https://forum.novelupdates.com/threads/improved-scribblehub-dark-theme.92205

### Update notes
I added a few quirky things too I hope you'll enjoy them
