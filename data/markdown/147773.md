### Description
Temporary theme caused by the migration of the forums on vBulletin v.5 </br>
<a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine/feedback-for-epic/1344336-unrealforums-theme">Discussion Thread</a> (please, leave feedback there if You want to; and feel free to <a href="https://www.paypal.me/sedokun/5">donate</a>, always appreciated)</br>
This theme won't work properly with Stylish for Chrome*, use Stylus instead.</br>
</br>
*due to bug in Stylish that prevents injection style in generated iframe</br></br>
p.s.: take a look on my other themes for UnrealEngine website <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/501227">here</a>

### Update notes
Use "Advanced Style Settings" button above ^
It would let You switch between Chrome and Firefox code, plus set some additional tweaks like:

Collapse signatures
Move topic tags ( to free additional space)
Move "last modified" tags ( to free additional space)
Disable coloration in posts

Custom Scrollbars are available only on Chrome atm. It is possible to make them for Firefox but due the nature they work it may ruin some themes.
