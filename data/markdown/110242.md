### Description
You know, I am not sure why I did not make a skin like this in the first place.  I guess I just like things pretty for my Google.  Still, I wanted to see if Google would make an option for this in it's own code.  Well, it hasn't happened and as part of a special request (Thanks Brett) I have made this one for those of you who want a simple Google experience without all the white background that hurts your eyes. This is for you.
