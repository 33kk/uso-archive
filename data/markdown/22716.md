### Description
It's a black and grey style view. It's good for people who train long times and hate the eye pain. And it also removes the adds and banner.
So, have fun. There's a couple of bugs, you can't see the text you type, so have some tasty cookies.
Or, just have the gyms saved to friends list.
Have fun training.
