### Description
This changes the bg color for the current day, today, to stand out in Google calendar. No more checking the system tray clock to see what day it is because you can't see what day is highlighted in Google Calendar anymore! With this you can easily see what day is today by the nice blue highlighted background color. ***UPDATED 10/23/2009***
