### Description
Tries to make RES night mode a bit more bearable/usable, nothing too fancy.

<b>NOTE:</b> Does not work with <b>RES 4.6.0</b> released 10th January 2016. It was meant for <b>version 4.5.4</b> released 30th December 2014.

The new RES fixes most of the bad styling and even supports custom style tweaks
