### Description
The windows browsers render the fonts based on the normal sub-pixel rendering without implementing Font smoothing, anti-aliasing as noticeable as Mac OSX. This tweak applies text to be displayed more anti-aliased using CSS3 property. So modern browsers supporting CSS3 and userstyle support would be able to support it. ;)
