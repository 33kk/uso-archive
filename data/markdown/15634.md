### Description
This skin makes the simple-theme of Hattrick use the full screen-width.

Update 18.6.09: Made the new HT-Live wide.

Update 3.9.09: Fixes. No more singleLine detailled PostingHeader in Forums though, as Foxtrick does it better.

Update 16.11.09: Fixed HT-live after HTs have changed it, and made it use full screen width.
