### Description
This is my ongoing first attempt at a GameFOX theme. I started with darkgreenclassic and made changes that made it look better to me. When you use this theme in GameFOX, check the box beside "Disable Main Stylesheets on GameFAQs".

I changed the green to a shade that I prefer. I added the "example theme" that spynae made. I made the quick post box bigger. It is now the same size as the messages and it lines up with them on the right.

I'm still looking for the notes I wrote on exactly what changes I made. When I find them, I'll post more details here.
