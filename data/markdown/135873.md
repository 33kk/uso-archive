### Description
A dark theme for The Verge version 3.  Attempts to embrace the new color styles (PINK!) while darkening and improving font size and other miscellaneous things.  Uses a Dark gray rather than a full black.

This style was built on top of an older dark theme, and thus supports the older verge article versions that still float around on the site.
