### Description
a theme based off of the simply black facebook theme; see changelog for where it differs. although it may not be done for a while, the finished colour scheme will feature black, red and gold (for contrast text such as tags) as the main colour scheme. name is chosen ready for the finished theme. please feel free to mention if any specific css is for messenger.com (the original style was for that as well, however i figure it's better to separate them). feel free to suggest style settings you would like to see.
