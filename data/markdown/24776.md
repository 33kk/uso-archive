### Description
Right-aligns the thumbnail pictures of blip contributors and hides the time that the blip was last edited. All of these changes can be selectively reversed by moving the appropriate selectors between the CSS that either float:rights or display:none's them. The names ([dc=names], [dc=menu], [dc=time]) are even pretty self-explanatory!

Makes waves look much more professional and more cleanly formatted.
