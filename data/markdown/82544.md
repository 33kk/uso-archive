### Description
For some reason, email digests seem to have more issues with nice styling.  My biggest complaint is about unncessary whitespace.

This will be an accumulation of fixes for digests that I come across.  Feel free to suggest others.  Nothing to do with Gmail, except for the selectors

* Update for Google Group Digests
