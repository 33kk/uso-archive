### Description
If you can't wait for Social Bug Tracking, you have come to the right place! High quality formatting makes BugTracker.NET look cleaner. Dealing with bugs has never been this more social and fun, you'd even look forward to fix more bugs with this User Style!

● Bug List: More readable, fits more info on the screen.
● Edit Bug and Search screens: Uncluttered, No more noisy borders.
● Bug Comments: Cleaner Facebook-look.
● And we didn't stop there. We made the Settings Screen look like Zune's Metro UI!


WARNING: Your boss might think you're using Facebook during work!


STEPS:
● After installing, double-check your url-prefix so that it points to your BugTracker.NET website URL.
● Configure your Bugtracker.NET Settings to show 50 bugs per page.
● Install "Klavika" font family if you want "BugTracker.NET" logo look similar to Facebook (Pictured in the Screenshot)
