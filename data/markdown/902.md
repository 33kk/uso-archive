### Description
Allows the sidebar's slider to move freely all the way from left to right.
It removes the sidebar's minimum and maximum width restrictions.

Tested with FF1.5.0.6, FF2.0 and FF3.0.

Disabled last rule (allowing sidebar to be opened completely), because on FF3 it caused the browser-part to have extra space above tabs when using scroll-wheel. May still work on older versions.

Tested for FF3.0
