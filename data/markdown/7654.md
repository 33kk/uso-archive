### Description
The avatar section of about.com wastes a lot of space while the addressee and thread / number info of the message is underneath the box, increasing the height of the message; this Stylish script uses relative re-placement of the elements to make it seem as if the original designers hadn't messed this up. ;)

This is a quick solution with not much testing to it, so updates may follow.

Version 0.1: initial release.

Version 0.1.1: some bugfixes, now includes positioning of 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons in user's own messages and moderator view.
