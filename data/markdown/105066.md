### Description
I know some of you are displeased with the font I've used for the <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/100987/facebook-desktop-theme">Desktop Theme</a>. Unfortunately, Comic Sans MS is the only web-safe font which looks (more or less^^) handwritten. But with this little add-on you can override that, and use any font, as long as it's installed on your computer.

### Update notes
This style is just an add-on. It will change the font on Facebook pages, but nothing else.
