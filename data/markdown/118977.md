### Description
2019 UPDATE: Eclipse was a disappointment so I'm currently working on this again! If you want to donate you can use the Paypal button above, a lil' donation goes a long way! It really motivates me to work more on this when I see people appreciate the time and effort it takes to do this.

I'm proud to present the most complete dark skin for Deviant Art! This is a much updated and improved skin based on LilyB's skin. You can customize the header bar colors (green by default) to any solid color or gradient that you want!  For a solid color, set both gradient values the same. More customizable settings soon! Please rate the skin if you liked it so others can know this is good :P Enjoy!

I also make music!  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/guitarjorge24">Check out my SoundCloud here!</a>
