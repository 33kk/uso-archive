### Description
Do you want a clean, quick way to read Reddit's headlines, without all the arrows, icons, and other interactive stuff cluttering up the screen?

Reddit - Stripped to the bones is clean and simple -- Reddit, stripped of everything except search form, headlines (fluid display), "submitted by" times, comment links, and prev/next links. Headlines are bold-face. Visited headlines are gray. And fluid design allows it to resize to your current window size.
