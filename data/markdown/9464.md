### Description
The reader chooses the main text size.  Changes from this size are only for headings and other short runs of text.

All photos or logos representing participants are shown at the full size of 96 pixels square.

Browsing history information is not hidden: the link colour shows whether the link is in the history.

Links are not underscored.

The "wbr" tag is ignored because it appears too often in odd places, such as "circulatio-n", "Fa-inting" and "siz-e".

Overlaps are fixed on the home page.

Three areas on the right of each screenshot are blanked to bring the after screenshot under the 75 KB limit.
