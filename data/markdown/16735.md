### Description
This limits the height of the highlight box to 300 px (changable, of course).
Since the content is higher than that, there's a scroll bar if you wanna view what's hidden by the height limit.
This also shrinks it down by just a few pixels so that there's room for the scroll bar, and moves the highlight type icons a little to the left so they aren't hidden by the scrollbar -- that results in them having a chance of slightly hiding the end of the story title.
