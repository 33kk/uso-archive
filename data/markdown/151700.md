### Description
Compact design with Drop-down menus. ( Windows width less than 850px )
This style is for Stylus / Chrome and Firefox.<br>
<br>
When the Window width is wide,"LT800" is a design just adding button look. On the other hand, if the window width is less than 850px, it will change to a compact design pursuing user friendliness. In addition, it designed to reduce the loss of CSS code by user's misoperation. This style is also very convenient when editing while comparing old and new codes with double windows.<br>
