### Description
Hides the Forward button when there is nothing to go forward to.
Hides the back button when there is nothing to go back to.

The purpose of this is to allow more space for the address bar in most cases (if you are like me and have everything crammed together).

Note: I recommend style 10 to use with this. (as shown in before/after screen shots)
