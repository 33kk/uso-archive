### Description
Basically, I wanted a theme for Reddit that wasn't one of these three things: 

- BLINDING MINIMALIST WHITE
- EDGY COOL DARK
- PUMPED UP BRIGHT COLORS

And couldn't find one. So I decided to make my own. Here it is. Unfortunately the documentation is <i>utter shit</i> (and also pretty much non-existent), because it's my first time trying to CSS anything and I honestly assumed it'd be a lot easier than it actually turned out to be. 

May work on nightmode in the future, but no plans as of yet. In case of bugs or something I overlooked, PM me at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gyrfalcons/">/u/gyrfalcons</a> for best results. See it in action (with some minor differences - apparently subreddit CSS won't let you use Unicode control characters in it, go figure) at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sepiareddit">Sepia Reddit</a>.
