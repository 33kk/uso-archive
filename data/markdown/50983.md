### Description
The navbar will always be at the top or bottom depending on how you set it. Now works right on all themes except one. Doesn't work at all on Divinity.

### Update notes
10/14/2013 - Now works right on all themes except one. Doesn't work at all on Divinity.
10/13/2013 - Minor layout adjustments.
07/24/2011 - Fixed issues with the fix I added last time.
07/22/2011 - Fixed the bottom version.
07/21/2011 - When I added the option to have the bar on the bottom of the screen I failed to notice the bar's pop ups still go down which hides most of their options. So until I figure out how to fix it I recommend not using the bottom version.
07/19/2011 - Added the forum jump to the bar
