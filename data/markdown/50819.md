### Description
- Removes avatars from Original Post and Most Recent Post columns
- Makes the background match the footer.
- Shrinks size of post count and view count numbers
- Makes sign in button, username, and breadcrumbs white
- Turns mini inline pager blue instead of green and makes it the same color as the main pager
- Makes quotes much more prominent with blue background and black borders (this will probably be changed somewhat)
- Removes 'rank card' to left of avatars and re-centers them

To Come
- I haven't fixed spoilers look yet so it looks a bit weird, especially if you have spoilers inside quotes
- Mouse over highlights for the pagers
- Will probably change the 'new posts' indicator to something else but it's alright for now
- Get rid of the green arrow in Most Recent Post and in quote blocks
- Put ranks back in somewhere else
