### Description
This is a good dark mode for robloxforum.com 

Tested to work on Chrome and Firefox and it should work in every browser.

Style Settings are pretty glitchy. This is how I got it to work on my computer (hope this works for you):

Refresh the page. Page should tell you to update. --> Change style settings to how you want them --> Update the style

If you have just installed this for the first time, keep it as is at first to see what you're changing.

### Update notes
v3
- Wow.. 5 months since the last update.
- Completely rewritten while being careful not to repeat many issues. It's rewritten to point where it's pretty similar to the current style but with a few new issues and fixes.
- Style fixed. (v2.3.2 was broken as of yesterday)
- Improved support for older browsers.
- Improved look to be more similar to the website. Text is also brighter.
- Slightly improved and consistent.
- Tons of fixes, but issues come with rewritten code.
- In style settings: "Red background" has been renamed to "Background"

v2.3.2
- Text where you type stuff wasn't turning dark because of optimisations in v2.3, this is now fixed.
- Small adjustment to upgrades page.

v2.3.1
- Whoops, forgot to add in the new css code. The last update was an illusion.... 0101010)!)921i02w

v2.3
- Nice looking shadows below the main topbar. Not updated on the thumbnail yet :/
- Removed and remade "!important" throughout the code. Big improvement to this code, but there might be the same issues reappearing in some places if !important is needed. Please message me if new issues occur, thanks!
- Twitter widget background of images is dark now. You can only see this if an image fails to load there or if there's a partially invisible png.

v2.2.2
- A bunch of code was combined into 1 line in some places. Optimised from 865 to 781 lines of code.

v2.2.1
- An attempt to fix a message containing code.
- A random slice of white appeared out of nowhere in the polls. It's been voted out.

v2.2
- Wow.. this style was slowly dying. Last update was 2 weeks ago! (May 22nd)
- You can change the red background color.
- A few more labels have dark text.
- Many small changes that got lost while typing this.
- Updated to work with the new premium page.

Stay tuned, a bunch of style settings are gonna get added soon!

v2.1.2:
- A lot of small improvements. The most noticable changes are:
 > While the page is loading, really dark red and black will appear instead of those white squares.
 > Hovering over forum posts or watching code is now dark and won't boil your eyes out.
 > Anyone zooming in or is a mobile user (if any exist) have been saved from the bright light.
 > Text has been changed to black in a few places.
 > Small fixes that I didn't keep track of to put here.
 > Some wacky stuff got removed so this should work slightly faster.

v2.1.1:
- A few improvements.

v2.1:
- The newly added Sponsored Content is now dark. I might add an option to remove it all together in the future.
- A new thumbnail to update a few things.
- A few adjustments and fixes.

(BIG UPDATE) v2: 
Tons of things are now darker as well as:

- Any dropdowns or profile preview.
- Sending a message and the options.
- Small things that have been missed.
