### Description
This is a theme for proboards, modified from the very basic theme/skins Blue and Dungeon.  I've set it for all of *.proboards56.com, but that's silly; you should change the domain to the specific board you wish to change.

The big shiny feature here (as opposed to the offerings from the other skins the one proboard forum I use) is the ability to alternate colors on nested quotes and other blocks.
