### Description

So, after making my 4chan Haruhi style (And realizing I had a lot of work to do), I created this nice little style using a background I found a while back on AnimePaper. As with the Haruhi style, this is set to automatically appear only on /a/, though it can be changed easily.

And, for the first time, I have different backgrounds for 1024x768 and 1280x1024 monitors! This style is automatically set up to work with 1280 monitors, however, if you replace the links with these links:

It will look much better on a 1024 monitor.

Also, if you're a fan of my 4chan Haruhi Style, I'm currently making edits to it to make it look much better and cleaner. Make sure to update your style; I'm changing the images due to Photobucket being failure.

EDIT: Quote text fixed.
