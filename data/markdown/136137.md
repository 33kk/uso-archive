### Description
This will hide the navbar when not in focus and show when hover over tabs and the navbar itself.

NOTE: this will not work in fullscreen mode. If you are using fullscreen mode there is no point in using this one is it? Also this is a very rough way to achieve this effect so do not expect it to work flawlessly. If you find a bug I may not know how to fix it.
