### Description
phpinfo()


version 0.0.1


--[description]

As a userstyle, for dealing with ones which aren't your own script.  If it's your phpinfo script, you should probably just follow the URL below, and use that to see how to exclude default CSS, and paste this in its place.

Of course, I intentionally blanked the class="v" text for the screenshots.
