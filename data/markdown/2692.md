### Description
This is the first in what I hope will be a series of "Scores in Sidebar" styles for tracking live sports scores in the sidebar.  It shrinks the relevant data to 300px and sets the sidebar width to 300px.  The larger the screen the better it looks.

I use it with a modified version of style 1633.  If you can't get it to work properly with style 1633 leave a message in the forum and I'll post my modifications.

To use this you will need to create a bookmark to http://sports.yahoo.com/golf/pga/leaderboard  Right click on the bookmark and click the "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" box.

Future versions will use other sports scores sites that always show the current week's scores and that I don't otherwise use regularly (since the style will make unreadable in a full page and the page will always open in the sidebar).
