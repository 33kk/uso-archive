### Description
Keep the Steam store clean and simple!
<br>This custom style removes all the potentially unwanted elements of the updated Steam store such as the curators (from both the front page and the game pages), the recommendations, the queue, the new on Steam, the recently updated and the endlessly scrolling list at the bottom.
