### Description
This style adds the echo value of the options on the Faction Conflict Cards. It also adds what will be gained that can't be expressed in echos: menace changes, second chances, bundles, etc.

It also adds the echo value for all the Call in favours storylets, even though they are all the same.

Finally, it also adds a reminder to card options that give a favour when this is not communicated via the text on the card (like the The Heron Tower card).

This style works with the June 2018 redesign.
