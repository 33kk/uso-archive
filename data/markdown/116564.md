### Description
Version 1.9 - 2016-03-23

dark theme for seeing diffs on github. Only changes the code portions. Nothing else!

mostly started it out to improve the color used for comments, but got carried away. Simulated most of my vim colorscheme (or as much as github limited highlight allow for)

NOTE: github stopped using class and now add element styles directly to the highlighted line. so there is no way to change the yellow line! just click another line number and move the yellow to an empty line... damn you github
