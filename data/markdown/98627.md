### Description
<i>Blackboard</i> is one of the stock CodeMirror style sheets, adapted to Firefox's implementation. Firefox 27+ only.

Because of a Firefox+CodeMirror bug this isn't displayed quite like the original <i>Blackboard</i> - tags are not red in the original, for example. The <a href="/styles/98684">original look is here</a>, if you wish to compare.
