### Description
Works on: Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikimedia Commons, Wikimedia Meta, Wikisource, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wictionary, 
Wikiquote and Wikinedia Species.
This style makes the menu boxes float, moves some of them to the right, and highlights languages moving them to top of the list. Works on all Wikimedia projects, unfortunately not in all languages. I've tested it on Polish and English sites, seems to work fine in some of the others, too.
Looks really good on wide screen.

(It's that long because different projects have different sizes of the boxes, so they need different positions. Probably could be a bit shorter, I'll fix it sometime later. )
