### Description
<b style="color: #ee1111">The new version of Stylish and Firefox 57 removes the ability of a user-friendly way for distributing and installing browser's UI themes.
</br>On top of that, Firefox 57 comes with a lot of UI changes. And with a theme that consists of ~2700 lines, the sane thing going forward would be to do a complete rewrite of the theme for Firefox 57+. Unfortunately, I don't have nearly enough free time to do that.
</br>So, in combination of the two issues stated above, the theme is discontinued indefinitely.</b>
</br>
</br>
For anyone who's staying on Firefox 56 - you can still install and use this theme, but you'll need to install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/versions">Stylish 2.1.1</a> for it to work.
</br>
</br>
<i>After installing the theme you might need to restart Firefox to correct any visual bugs.</i>
