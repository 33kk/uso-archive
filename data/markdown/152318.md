### Description
Increases the facebook content column width by about 200px, resulting in a wider timeline.
<br/><br/>
There exists a lot of other "Facebook Wide" styles here, but most of them are outdated or also change the Facebook design.
<br/> This theme only makes the page a bit wider.
For images I had two options: either center them or enlarge them as well. I took the second one.<br/><br/>

This is just my personal style which I want to share with you. It's not well tested, but so far I didn't notice any problems. Feel free to report problems, but I can't guarantee that I will find time to fix it.
<br/>
See the screenshot for an example.

<br/>
Tested with Chrome and Firefox (latest versions)
