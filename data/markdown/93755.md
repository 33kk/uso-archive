### Description
This style fixes few bugs with SeaMonkey Modern theme and makes it look a bit more like in Mozilla Suite.

More exactly, it:
Removes text on Navigator buttons;
Reverts home button (only when on Personal Toolbar and in small icons mode) to the pre-2.0 one, as the new one is blurry;
Fixes menubar grippy pressing effect;
Adds proper borders to the right side of grippies;
Fixes fullscreen window controls;
Hides dropmarkers on disabled toolbar buttons;
Restores button, tab, menulist and navbar groove rounding;
Fixes bookmarks tree margins in sidebar.

If Mozilla branding is enabled, it also replaces the throbber, component bar navigator icon, and Window menu navigator icon with Mozilla ones.
