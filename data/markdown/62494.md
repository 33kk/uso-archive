### Description
This is just a quick-and-simple personal style that helps with some little annoyances on YouTube:

- Makes visited links dark grey. This works on both light and dark themes.
- Hides player controls invisible when the mouse is not hovered over the video. This makes it easier to pause and take a screenshot without the player controls getting in the way.
- Hides the 'Updated ToS' dialog in the bottom-left of the screen.
