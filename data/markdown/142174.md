### Description
New: you can now customize the Like / Dislike buttons and bar colors. Enjoy! :)

This makes the subscribe button less of an eyesore both when subbed and when not subbed, adds green and red voting, makes the scrollbar black, and fixes some other inconsistencies (mostly with hovering icons).<br /><br />
DARK MODE:<br />
The new youtube design actually has dark mode in the settings. <a href="http://prntscr.com/f73de0">Click here to see how to enable it.</a>
