### Description
Shrinks the March09 layout by removing excess padding and such.

Combine this with the following Greasemonkey script: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/44687
which will merge the left bar (filters) into the right bar (highlights) as can be seen on the screenshot.

If you want to remove rounded corners, uncomment the appropriate rule in the CSS file.
