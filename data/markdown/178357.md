### Description
A simple dark theme I created for personal use. There may be some parts of the site that have not yet been themed.

The right panel is translucent, and will display whatever background image you choose in your showdown settings.

If the style is not being displayed, go to the settings and enter the following:
In the tab under the CSS, enter "applies to URLs on the domain: pokemonshowdown.com"


Credits:
It's been a long time since I created this style, but I believe it is an edit of the original style created by Bob Crables
