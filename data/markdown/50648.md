### Description
Adds some Windows Phone 7-like Metro design to Reddit. Should generally be compatible with Reddit Enhancement Suite, but it won't work with the "night mode" for various reasons, sorry. Note: I'm still working on this, so I apologize if it's not great right now. 

NOTE: You will have to go into settings and turn off custom styling by subreddits, because that might cause issues with the userstyle.
