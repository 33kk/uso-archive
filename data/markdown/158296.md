### Description
changes most stuff to be transparent and have a backdrop blur. 

IMPORTANT!

the Blur doesn't work in firefox, only in chromium based browsers and Safari since firefox doesn't provide support for Backdrop-Filter styles yet. You also have to use the dark youtube theme!


To work you need to activate the experimental web platform features flag under your chrome://flags settings and activate the dark youtube design.

1: type Chrome://flags into your adress bar
2: search for "experimental web platform features" and enable it
3: set your youtube to dark with youtube's design switch
