### Description
Originally developped by "lomo".

This style allows you to add an icon before each link which directs to a file like "jpg", "gif", "pdf", "swf", "doc", ...
The used icons comes from "http://www.famfamfam.com" website with the "silk icons" pack.

The style try to not change the original formatting of the websites.
