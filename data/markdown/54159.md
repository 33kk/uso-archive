### Description
Makes youtube's layout suck a little less

It should probably be noted that I actually made this for my portrait monitor, so as you would expect, everything is kept at the same width as the player and either above or below the player.

*UPDATED*
Added a dropdown list for default video player resolution selection- Recommend 480p or 720p for screens smaller than 1680x1050. at 1680x1050 or above 900p is worth trying (but might be too big if your browser has lots of toolbars or something).

UPDATE dec 10: Fixed fullscreen in the HTML5 player. :D
