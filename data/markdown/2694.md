### Description
In Linux, H2 on the CBC homepage defaults to the Serif font. Serif is larger than Times New Roman (which is the intended font) and so the headlines on the homepage can overrun and look ugly. This style spells out "Times New Roman" as the font to use for H2 instead of just "Times" and the headlines look correct.

Note that you need to download msttcorefonts package or get the Times New Roman font from somewhere for this to benefit you.
