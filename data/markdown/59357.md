### Description
Helvetica: a good simple font. Facebook's font (Lucida Grande)... not so good and simple.

****Attention****T
     As I no longer have a Facebook (seeing as how its use and importance are beginning to wane), I will no longer be updating the userstyle. I want to thank anyone who downloaded and/or shared this userstyle with their friends and familiars. Maybe when the next social network comes out, I will code another simplistic style. For now though, I'd like to say au revoir and have a fruitful life [making websites look a lot better].

**********

Let's face it, Facebook is a cluttered site. One thing hipsterism has brought into the world are clean and simple designs. If you want a simpler login and a cleaner font (Helvetica, of course) look no further than the "Facebook - Minimalist" userstyle!

Now features a new blue login window that slides down when you go to Facebook :)


Please rate and/or donate if you think this userstyle is dynamite!
