### Description
Installing World To Build++ style is recommended, but works without it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tired of the signature "WTB Orange" color all over the website? Want to restyle it to your *favorite* color? Then this style is for you! Combine the existing World To Build++ style with this plugin and you can experience the website unlike before. Enjoy! :)
