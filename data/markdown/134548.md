### Description
this is a colour edit of: <br>https://userstyles.org/styles/131999/nightmod-black-global-theme <br>a dark, grey/black theme for night time web browsing.
<p>
<b>i tested approx twenty-five dark themes on userstyles</b>, looking for one that didn't break features on websites. <br>unlike the large majority of dark themes on userstyles.org this nightmod theme uses clever things like transparent backgrounds, so parts of the page aren't 'lost'
<p>
what's different from the original: the links are yellow, the main text colour is lighter, and the backgrounds are darker. in addition, the new tab page is black, and the hovered links are stylized.
