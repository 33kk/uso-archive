### Description
Cleans up non-important links & filler, make reading/navigating easier.  "You may or may not" stuff is removed, as is bottom search box, top logo and other needless tripe. Ad,  top dead center, should be removed with AdBlock (with AB+ 0.7 disabled, DOM didn't pick it up or I'd have included it here for you).  Instead of "before and after," shots are both "after,"  top & bottom of page.
