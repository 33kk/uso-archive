### Description
send the FF4 tabs on the tile bar... but leaves enough space to the right of the tabs so you can grab the title bar and move the window around.
also fixes, the at least in my case, the title bar bug that makes it disappear when using certain win7 themes which use almost no border for the window frames.
this is one of them:

also works well with: http://dpcdpc11.deviantart.com/art/Maverick-for-Win7-194347855
it may sometimes still glitch the title bar but focusing and unfocusing the FF4 window fixes it.
Also replaces the Firefox Menu Button a bit to the right to make it look right.
