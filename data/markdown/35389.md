### Description
Everyone has their own view of what is unneeded on Amazon's incredibly cluttered pages.  This is mine.  It removes features I don't want, which includes making the purchase options area much simpler.  Each removal is clearly marked in the code if you'd like to take some out.

This is very similar to style 17515, if you'd like another option that removes a different set of elements.
