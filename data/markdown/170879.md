### Description
Want to code with Scratch, but the editor is too bright? This style applies a dark theme to the online Scratch (3) editor so you can code in peace.

### Update notes
I also recommend installing Eribetra's userstyle to darken other parts of the website here: <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/173170/dark-theme-for-scratch">https://userstyles.org/styles/173170/dark-theme-for-scratch</a>
