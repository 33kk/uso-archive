<blockquote>
<b>Tronscan</b> is the first block explorer based on TRON. It not only includes some basic functions of the block explorer, such as search query transactions, accounts, blocks, nodes, smart contracts; data statistics and queries on the chain, but also directly supports token creation. Tronscan also has a built-in web wallet and Bancor-based DEX, which enriches the Tronscan application matrix.
