### Description
For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds. 

This style overrides Firefox "In-Content UI"(browser UI is presented in Tab) from hiding of the Bookmarks Toolbar, so it can be seen when viewing the Add-ons Manager. (Note: Bookmarks Toolbar must be enabled for style to work.)

To UN-hide the Navigation toolbar due to "In-Content UI" use style:
style 41425
