### Description
This style makes the cursor change to the respective site's favorite icon (favicon) 

when the cursor is hovered over the additional links added by the CustomizeGoogle 

Firefox extension.  This is similar to many other cursor hover ("link warning") 

userstyles, such as my take on that theme - style 2538.

This style applies to Google web search results.  I might also suggest you try try my 

userstyles that acomplish this for the other supported sites:

style 2539,
style 2540,
style 2541.


Enjoy!  Please feel free to leave comments.  Thanks!
