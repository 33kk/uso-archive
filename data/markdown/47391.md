### Description
<b>Warning:</b>
<ul>
<li>It has been <a href="http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/32819/x">reported</a> that this style interferes with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdfjs/">pdf.js</a>, making documents unsightly.
</ul>

Alt. title - "Midnight Surfing Lite". Bound to mess things up.  Mainly tested on Firefox.

Simpler and smaller (about 1/2 file size of the original), with very minor color changes.

Compared to the original, performance is worse when dealing with icons.  When having to give objects solid BG colors - it's better (gives it to objects that need it) or worse (obscures elements, thus interferes with functionality/usage).

Original - style 23516
