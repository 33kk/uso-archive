### Description
A MODIFICATION to the new Neowin Finity re-design:

Added padding and set "nicer" width to make the site look easier on the eye. Not the most efficient use of CSS, but it works.

Again, I'd like to congratulate Neowin staff on all the hard work gone into this re-design. It's clearly been a massive effort and this mod is intended to complement that effort.

Same as other Finity "Mod" (updated fairly regularly), now with 95% width applied for all you old-timers!

UPDATE: NO ADS REMOVED - view ads and support Neowin! - it's the least you can do!
