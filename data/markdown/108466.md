### Description
Hides "Trending" and "Who to Follow" boxes across all of twitter and brings back the "Photos & Videos" grid (instead of the new suuuuuper long single-column list of photos to scroll through!)

Notes: the styling on the grid is a little janky, but hopefully not too janky! Take a look at the screenshot to see if it's #2janky4u. I'd like to update it later to be a little cleaner and less eager to overcrop thumbnails when there's a ton of whitespace, but I just wanted to get something functional for now!
