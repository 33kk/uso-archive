### Description
This is an edit of the "make home.myspace.com look half decent" style that can be found here http://userstyles.org/style/show/2218

This is the same design, however it uses a silvery background and changes the blocks to blue. I have Added option to change the style of the info bar. I hope this works for you guys and comments & reviews are welcome as I hope to be doing some more styles in the future. Most of the credit belongs to the original creator. 

After: http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y277/devil_dreg/myspaceafter3.png (shows the defult code outcome, does not show the optional info bar edit. May look diffrent in your browser!)

(EDIT: Changed a few  bugs, Added an option to remove the "Show my" links in the info bar & to enlarge the profile view and network size font, The screenshot does not show this)
