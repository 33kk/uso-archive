### Description
Rounds corners and adjusts appearance of textarea, select, input, and button fields. Changes borders/outline/background color when hovered.  Resulting eye-candy is somewhat Safari-like.  Applies globally, but you can exclude sites or apply it only to selected sites.

*** Note: the corresponding 'Rounded Forms' Greasemonkey script performs the same functions.
      See http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/29819 for the Greasemonkey script

Version 1.11 (26-Apr-09)
  Just a few tweaks to make it behave better with sites that have their own CSS for these elements.

Version 1.10 (16-Apr-09)
  Simplified greatly -- Redesigned so that input, textarea, and select fields and buttons have dimensions identical to these 
 	items as defined in Firefox's 'forms.css' file.  This improves the appearance on most sites (including YouTube)
 	Corrections made in the 1.10 version should take care of the issues mentioned by tbone and kuroi-ryu.
 
Takes off from the ideas in http://userstyles.org/styles/787 and extends it to dropdown lists ('select' tags).
