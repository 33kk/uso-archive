### Description
A complete high contrast view for the RingCentral web app (previously Glip) located at https://app.glip.com.

The goal of this is to help those that have issues with visibility of the standard RingCentral interface, as well as those that simply like a darker theme. If you have feedback <em><i>please</i></em> comment and let me know. I would really like to focus on usability/accessibility for those that need it.

In order to see the full high contrast styling, you must select the High Contrast color theme in settings. Get to settings by clicking your avatar image circle at the top right of the page, then go to "Preferences" to select a color theme.
