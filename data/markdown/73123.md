### Description
Tumblr is set to have a default font of Helvetica Neue which I discovered when I downloaded it for my computer a few days ago. Maybe I didn't download the version Tumblr developers have because it looks like shit on the Dashboard. I know mac might look prettier with it, but not windows.

So, anyway. I basically just deleted all instances of "Helvetica","Helvetica Neue". So it's either, Arial or sans-serif where it would be Helvetica.

There's font options. Let me know if you want more options. I'll add them.
