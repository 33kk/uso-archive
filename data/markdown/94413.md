### Description
Liqube Day style

A nice blend of subtle grey tones and adjusted text colors for day-time surfing and easier reading. Once again less strain on the eyes compared to the classic white background color scheme. Background images are kept with this style. Images are slightly faded. Uncomment and adjust the font-family line in order to force a specific font. This style complements my Liqube Night style.

Let me know if like this or if you find it useful :) Thanks

Enjoy!
