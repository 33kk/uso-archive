### Description
CSS Style for funnyjunk.com/america/ cause I hate people.
Must be used with posttwo's funnyjunk addon with CSS disabled in the addon settings.
Addon can be found here - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fj-moderator-extension/ijdldpdghacgnjacajblibllhklhkdjj

Since it's unclear to many as to how to use the extension, there is a new button on the top-left of the website which gives you additional options to switch CSS off, this is required for Stylish to work on the FJ boards.

### Update notes
version 1.0.2:
New Logo.
Advanced settings! 
You may now pick your own hover image instead of having to see Tem everywhere.
More customization options to come soon.

version 1.0.1:
Added additional stuff that makes content prettier
Added /america/'s emoji sheet
Deleted Logan Paul
