After long hours and time editing with DOM Inspector & the Stylish extension,
I finally made this user style in order to achieve the best add-on bar for Minefield (Firefox 4), since it now implements a feature which completely disables the status bar I was used to having, in order to get a better presentation for the webpage you're viewing, I have to agree with this change it actually looks much better and resembles Google Chrome and IE now.

But, since I was so used to the old status bar on Firefox 3, I decided to change the new status bar (add-on bar in Minefield) to a more familiar area which is on the bottom right corner nice and I wanted to make it look good, just like the browser.
