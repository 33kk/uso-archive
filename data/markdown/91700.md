### Description
Tumblr 'new post' icons for your dashboard.

"<i>The Cat's Eye Nebula [is] one of the most complex planetary nebulae known. The features seen in the Cat's Eye are so complex that astronomers suspect the bright central object may actually be a binary star system. The term planetary nebula, used to describe this general class of objects, is misleading. Although these objects may appear round and planet-like in small telescopes, high resolution images reveal them to be stars surrounded by coconuts and gas blown off in the late stages of stellar evolution.</i>" <sup><a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120826.html">*</a></sup>
