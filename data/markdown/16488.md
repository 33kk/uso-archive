### Description
This style is a companion style for my style 11912 (best results if applied together).

What this style does:
Surrounds each comment (review) with a border to make the look more stylish. (Hover effect is added as well).

Update: Fixed code (thanks to user 4241 for report). Also changed hover effect and overall appearance.
