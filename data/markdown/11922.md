### Description
Facebook themed like my other Dark Shiny Blue, transparency themes.

Facebook: http://fb.me/DaedalusIcarusHelios.themes

***Requires Firefox 35 or later for some effects***
-Any performance issues seem to be due to too many effects (text-shadow, box-shadow, and gradients).  I've reorganized the code with comments at the top so you can comment out the text-shadow and box-shadow sections.  
-In regards to scrolling slowness, I recommend using the Firefox Add-on Yet Another Smooth Scrolling rather than the native smooth scrolling.
