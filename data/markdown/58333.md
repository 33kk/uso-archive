### Description
A quick change to make viewing Livejournal pages a little easier on the eye since Release 88 made it hard to view.

Basically back to Verdana, slightly changed font sizes, and a light grey background.
Added slightly wider margins, the mystery buttons now show all the time, not just on hover, and the dark blue border around add comment box is no more.

Choose a colour before install - the default is what it was in the first versions - I've added a slightly darker grey, and white as options :)

### Update notes
v1     Grey background, Verdana
v1.1   Added rollover button effects, removed ugly dark blue border around "add comment" button, tweak font size, add margins
v1.2   Also stops hover on collapsed "check" box
v1.3   Added flattening of blue comment borders, and fixed issue with those collapsed borders.  Date on comments in black.
