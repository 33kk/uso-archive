### Description
A black, cleaner layout for http://verpets.com.

http://verpets.com/register.php?refer=Dakata

The banner ad has been moved from the bottom to the top because it's a nice, cute site, and I don't mind enabling ads for sites like this. C: But I am not responsible for anyone who disables ads, obviously. :P Since I -support- them.

You may change the colors if you want to, if you prefer other colors such as black and red, or grey and blue, etc.
#FFF = #FFFFFF = White (Text)
#0A0 = #00AA00 = Dark Green (Forms) 
#000 = #000000 = Black (Background)

(Yes, I'm using pretty much the same code for my profile. ;P)

EDIT:
Fixed for the layout change, because they moved the ad up (But to the right, and not the left :( ). You can remove it if you want to, by either using Adblock or putting div#ad next to div#footer, like so: (But replace the asterisks with the appropriate brackets, of course :) )
div#footer, div#ad *
	display: none !important*
