### Description
A dark theme for the various Bloc pages. The standard is too bright for my taste. I've used a 5 color theme for the most part, but everything is set up using variables, so you can change the colors to your taste. Click Customize Settings above to choose different colors. It's a work in progress, so let me know if you see any issues. Originally based on Thinkful Courses Dark (https://userstyles.org/styles/166064/thinkful-courses-dark).

### Update notes
v2020.3.2-1 new version numbering; fixed some class names on the overview page
