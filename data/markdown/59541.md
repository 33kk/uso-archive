### Description
Hurf derf

No longer necessary since the spoilers are not forced any more, but I'll keep it up in case moot messes with something again.

### Update notes
Doesn't fix spoilers, just removes the background from spoilers and fixes the colour when hovered, so you don't need to hover text to see it. Installs on top of various different styles.
Oh yeah it fixes greentext too, I forgot to add that.

Added Foolz to the script, since it's back up now.


Oh and for the love of god make sure you uninstall it after everything goes back to normal.
