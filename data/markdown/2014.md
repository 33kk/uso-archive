### Description
I really loved Valacar's version "Google Web Search - dark blue redesign (vC)" (http://www.valacar.com/userstyles/) and have changed some code so that the design goes across to all Google Search domains (ie. .co.uk, .com.au, etc.). 

afaik, this currently only works with www.google.com.au. Maybe other users can post whether this has worked in their particular google domain.

*NOTE*: this is a simple copy & paste (with some editing) from Valacar's work. I DO NOT take credit for any of this so please no lawsuits.
