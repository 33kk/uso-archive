### Description
if visited, text will get purple and images will get a purple border.

Why hover?
     there are a lot of limitations on what you can do with visited now. What u can do now is change the color of things (but does not work with opacity and does not work if the element doesn't have a value of the think u want to change EX: bg color).  And i wanted a visited indicator that worked with images, but making every image get a border was ugly so i did a cool animation effect on linked images that also show if u visited the page
