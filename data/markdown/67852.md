### Description
The ads and people widget displayed on the right side of the message or conversation would not be so bad except they waste valuable space with emptiness the rest of the way down.  I couldn't figure out a way to have the conversation flow around this extra stuff, so  this style moves them to the bottom, each taking 50% of the width.  If the message being displayed is shorter than one window height, you will have to scroll lower to see the ads and poster info.
