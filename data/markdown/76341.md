### Description
Australis transparency on your tabs.
It works fine for me. I do not have any kind of problem with it.

Actually i did not create it all, it is a combination of codes, The base code is here:

http://userstyles.org/styles/65431/fxchrome-style-australis-silver

And i made some changes based on this code, 

http://userstyles.org/styles/60468/firefox-australis-mockup-theme

which works better, but it disables the Tabs animation when you close 1 Tab among many tabs.
([The animation] - It keeps tabs without moving, until you stop hovering among tabs; if this is disabled, you may close tabs accidently) 
Which was annoying, because i tend to have many tabs opened.

[It supports Personas]
