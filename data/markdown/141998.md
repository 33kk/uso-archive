### Description
<p>This is the 2017 Youtube design update version of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/130610/youtube-umbra">Youtube Umbra</a></p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Designed to work with the dark mode for the new 2017 design, so please turn that on in order to use this theme.<br>
You can find this under the menu at the top right where your avatar is.</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> This style is currently in development and there are quite a few things that are currently in a development state, including colours that are specifically set for me to be able to easily identify what they change across the site.</p>

<p>Please only use this theme if you can put up with the in-development nature of this current style as it will probably have a number of issues until I've finished it for varying reasons.</p>

<p>Most likely I know about any issues with the current design as it's in active development, so there is little need to post about bugs and issues at this stage.</p>
