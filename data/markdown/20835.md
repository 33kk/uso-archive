### Description
This userstyle removes the big yellow banner that Amazon.com has put on the top of every catalog page telling me that the credit card they have on file for my Amazon Prime account is an inaccurate one, and so Prime won't automatically renew.  Well, I had already set Amazon Prime to not automatically renew, so you really shouldn't even be bothering me, Amazon.
