### Description
Replacement for the now retired "muzzle" Gmail labs feature

http://groups.google.com/group/gmail-labs-help-muzzle/

It hides people's status messages in your Gmail chat-contacts list.

It does this simply by setting the display property to "none" for anything in the "vG" class, which afaict (but haven't checked very thoroughly) is used exclusively for these messages.
