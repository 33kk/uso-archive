### Description
This is for the new (since Oct 2008) Rappelz forum web site.

Verbose comments and pre-tested optional extras are included throughout this style to encourage the end user to customize to your personal preference. All the basics are taken care of by the default. The only useful links lost in the default are the Rappelz Library, Rappelz Arsenal and Profile & Achievement. These are easily accessed from any of several other pages.

The following optional extras are commented out by default:
1) hide the orange gPotato menu;  
2) hide the BG image at top; 
3) hide the entire red navigation menu; 
4) hide the fixed width RAPPELZ FORUMS top nav-bar bg image (Ack. style 10924 by user 15295); 
5) hide the footer; 
6) hide signatures (useful if you often browse the forum without logging in)

Unmodified CSS classes and ids are listed in one long trailing comment to invite you to explore new possibilities and then, perhaps, suggest an enhancement for this style.

Firefox feature reminder: If you use a very high resolution desktop then try "Ctrl + mouse wheel" to scale the page and relieve eye strain. If no mouse wheel then use "Ctrl  +" and "Ctrl -".
