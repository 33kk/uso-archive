### Description
This is a style sheet I created which inserts icons before or after links on a page, in order to inform the user of whether these links open other programs, open new windows, use certain protocols, utilize javascript or plug-ins etc...

This style sheet should work in any browser, and I am sure it will prove useful on any platform. It's helpful for identifying what a link is bringing you to before you click on it. If you have any comments, leave one here. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to discuss them with me, I encourage it. Otherwise, enjoy!

Note: Although the screenshot only shows a few examples, this style sheet supports over 60 file types and over a dozen protocols.

Icon credit goes to Mark James.
Compatible with GreaseKit and GreaseMonkey.
