### Description
Due to the redesign (13-12-2011) of the Escapist site I've redone my style.

I've removed the header (including ad), the entire right column (removing bits is tricky cause they don't use an id per box).

Also removed the share bar at the bottom and the Facebook comments.

The login panel went too cause while you can minimize it, it does not remember your choice so you have to minimize it every time.
