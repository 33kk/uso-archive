### Description
The youtube pop-out feature was amazing when if first came out. unfortunately youtube has decided to take out this neat little feature.

Because of that I have written up some code that shall make any youtube video fit the dimensions of your browser. This is also compatible with playlists, moving the sidebar to the top left corner of your screen where it shall remain minimized until hovered over with your mouse. This also features the comments and video information on the right side.
