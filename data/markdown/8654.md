### Description
My actual theme! I spent a lot of time on this... and I had to split the code in a few styles cause it was too big to be uploaded.
So here it is the basic theme, if you like it, and want more extensions skinned, give also a look to the other Simple-Gray Styles!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does:
 - replace those ugly Vista bars with gray bars
 - makes the textboxes rounded and hover-sensitive
 - makes everything a little more compact and rounded
 - makes the Bookmarks-Bar Vista-like style
 - makes the Find-Bar Vista-like style
 - makes the "NTBOTR" tab smaller and skinned
 - align the "Faviconized Icon" to the center of the Tab
 - more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported Extensions:
 New Tab Button on Tab Right (NTBOTR), FaviconizeTab.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
 This Theme is the base of all the other Simple-Gray Styles. If you
 want to use them, it's recommended to apply this theme too for a
 better integration. Also to fully enjoy it you should have
 installed at least a couple of the supported extensions.
