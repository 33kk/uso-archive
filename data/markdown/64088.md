### Description
White, less cluttered and responsive.

### Update notes
Version 1, I've done it in a couple of hours so don't expect it to be perfect :P. Reply me at <a href="http://twitter.com/juanangeldr">@juanangeldr</a> for any feedback.

<ul><li>Responsive -so you can keep it in a side of your screen while you read your saved items.</li>
<li>Some elements (sidebar, add link, top menu) show on hover.</li>
<li>Option to hide like page and buttons.</li>
<li>Browse link, sharing options and "text" button have been removed. <i>Do you think they're necessary? <a href="http://twitter.com/juanangeldr">Ask for it</a>.</i>
<li>And, as you can see, better look: whiter, wider.</li></ul>
Note: since horizontal scroll bar is hidden, sidebar might not show entirely in lower resolution screens.

Tested in Chrome and Firefox, latest versions.
I use it with Autopager.
