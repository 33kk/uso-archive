### Description
Gmail Cleaner and Ad Remover
(Version 1.0) 
January 28, 2007

I love the Clean Gmail code that was developed.  However,
I felt that too much was removed including the very useful
search function, so I added that feature back in.

I also added the remove ad feature to this script.

Full credit for the ad removal code goes to "Shadow the
hedgehog" who wrote the Gmail - remove ads script.
