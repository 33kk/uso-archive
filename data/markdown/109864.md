### Description
Basically a fix for the entirety of tumblr. Like what even happened there.

This style adds in dashed lines around text entry fields for the new post pop up thing. You'll see it whenever you go to make a post. If you dislike these, the last three entries in the code can be removed to set them back to the default.

EDIT: Fixed the links being blue, that was a mistake on my part. Update by clicking the green button below if you haven't already!


EDIT 2:
WOW mine sucks hey use this one instead!
