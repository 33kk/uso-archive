### Description
Replaces images background by a white-grey grid while hovered, so you can see whether/how transparent it is.

Complicated selector is because of compatibility with the style 4150, which this one initially came from (you can merge them again and prevent some duplicity of code).

Notes: obviously, does not work with "images" placed as background-images.

Change log:
2008-01-09 : added inverted dotted outline for hovered images: this will reveal whether the image is placed as real "IMG" or not.
2009-01-23 : only -> first

Notes:
- "invert" IS a valid value of "outline-color" property -- so ignore installation warning. See http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/ui.html#propdef-outline-color
- If you want to be sure that the hovered image is not "unnaturally" resized: style 8188
