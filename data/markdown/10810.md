### Description
Fanfiction.net.
I wanted to adjust the font of the stories (mainly line-height and spacing) so it was a bit easier to read.
Changed the background and link colors as well, nothing major.
Big thanks to Stendec style 1300 whose AdBlock part I stole.

Update - letter spacing wasn't working too well (especially the 'oo' combination looked odd)
So I removed it, also increased the font size a little...
