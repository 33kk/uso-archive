### Description
This is a extension of an older style as discussed here. http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/32493/compatible-with-any-ff-after-3

Installation of the addon(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-highlighter/) is required. Style will not work without the addon.

I take no credit except for posting it here so others who are searching for a solution may benefit from it.

If the idea of pending a pic doesn't appeal to you because the pic doesn't resize accordingly to the link size, reference this style http://userstyles.org/styles/75938/visited-link-addon-visited-link-supporter on how to use a text symbol instead.

The blue star pic is from the following style

Important: I use before for bookmark and after for visited to avoid conflict.
