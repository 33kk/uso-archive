### Description
This style is supposed to make web page content linear. The idea came from considering the dimensionality things such as written text, number systems, other abstract modes of communication. I am unsure if this has a practical use.

*** WARNING: USING THIS STYLE MAY CRASH FIREFOX ***

The only place that I have tested this style is in Opera.
