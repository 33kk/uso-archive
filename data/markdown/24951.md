### Description
Everytime i see twitter's web-intetface i remember how good it was when had a Georgia font, for some reason i made this userstyle only now, and this userstyle makes twitter look as awesome as it must be :)

Changelog:

v1.0
- All headers now not bold and wrote with Georgia font
- «Following», «Followers» and «Listed» now have the same color as whole text
- Nicknames of tweet's authors have the same color as whole text and a ":" symbol after them
- New RSS icon (from http://pinvoke.com/)

v1.0.1
- no ":" after usernames in retweeted by list.

v1.0.2
- Fix for previous fix. The ":" symbol after teweet's author comed back :D

And by the way, follow me @ http://twitter.com/almlex/ ;)
