### Description
EDIT: Obsolete now, since GameFAQs added a top-right menu.

Currently the link to the original file of a FAQ (usually a plain text file) is hidden (display: none) on smaller screens (width of 767px and smaller). This simple style brings it back (and some other things like the version number and the date of the last update as well).
