### Description
Keeps Google search's top bar at the top of the window, rather than scrolling it with the page. Also fixes the search results page list in its own bar, so you don't have to scroll to the bottom to move to the next page of results.

This style is a direct copy from my Grease Monkey script that does the same.  That script can be found at:
http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/8536

Compatible (and totally bitchin') with the Auto Page Firefox extension *:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/...

Also works with Customize Google (head nod to RNik) *:

If any particular searches break the style, post it in a comment. Likewise, if any extensions, styles or GM scripts break the page, post a comment. When posting, please note whether you are logged into a Google account or not.

*: extensions do tend to introduce some quirks, but nothing that is a deal breaker so far
