### Description
I was annoyed at the style of FurAffinity. Especially due to the fact the "beta" never evolved.
So I made this theme, which at first started as a small CSS to make profiles more readable.

### Update notes
<b><u>Changelog</u></b>
v0.9.0
  • Fixed for the current version of FA. Oh god you have no ideas how much I struggled to fix it.
  • Tweaked random details such as the BBCode formatting icons, box shadows, etc...
  • Recreated the old Profile Comments section.
  • The theme will be transitionned to the UserCSS Format for v1.0.0, in order to make use of a preprocessor.
    That also means both userstyles.org and Stylish support will end after it comes out. I'll switch to Github/OpenUserCSS when the time comes.
v0.8.0
  • Actually didn't release this version, look at v0.9.0.
v0.7.1
  • Fixed Administrator Notice's background color.
v0.7.0
  • Added a custom scrollbar. You can disable it in the theme settings.
  • Changed the default font of the theme.
  • Minor code refactoring.
v0.6.7
  • Random minor fixes.
v0.6.6
  • Made a new banner for the profile of Tiny Plume.
v0.6.5
  • Fixed new shouts/comments.
  • Removed custom banner from Tiny Plume's profile. I sadly lost the file, and my host removed it.
v0.6.1
	• Themed the Shinies related stuff.
v0.6.0
	• Removed my other username from the theme's credits.
	• Themed the announcement thingy.
v0.5.0
	• Changed the default background colors.
	• Fixed some random stuff.
	• The tags now have a different look.
	• The search bar is now colored too. -- This introduces a small glitch where the search icon disappears during the transition to the search bar. Am looking into how to fix it.
	• The forums shouldn't be touched by this theme at all anymore.
	• Remade the banners, the new ones should work no matter if you're using a 4K monitor or if you're on mobile.
v0.4.0
	• Removed the temporary fix for centered text, which is no longer needed.
	• Reorganized the code a bit.
	• You can now enable an option to blur Mature / Adult content until hovered. It's disabled on mobile.
	• Added full background colors customization. There is however, no workaround for text colors yet. Be warned.
	• Added some custom theme thingies to the profiles of Tiny-Plume and Cuteness-Overlord.
v0.3.2
	• Removed the borders of the comment text areas.
	• Fixed the shadows of some sections.
	• Fixed the avatar borders not being very visible.
	• Disabled the custom profile themes, but not their banners.
v0.3.1
	• Fixed a little issue with the navbar dropdown menus.
	• Fixed centered text on profiles not working by... Forcing all profile descriptions to be centered.
	  Might not please everyone, sadly...
	• Changed the footer's credits yet again...
v0.3.0
	• Changed the banner of the site.
	• You can now choose a custom font.
	• Overhauled how the theme works, advanced users can change the background colors to their likings using the variables at the start of the CSS.
	  The main reason I didn't make that an option on userstyles.org is because it's not only hard to get decent results, but also need custom code on top of it to fix font colors.
	  Asking the user for two text color settings would be weird, so I decided to leave things like they are for now.
	  Might consider adding that as an option later, though.
	• Entirely themed the profiles of Tiny Plume and Cuteness-Overlord to try that "Advanced stuff".
v0.2.1
	• Made the theme work properly on mobile. (Stylus for Firefox / Chromium-based browsers on Android.)
v0.2.0
	• Added custom colors support, both through userstyles.org settings and through variables in the code.
v0.1.4
	• Fixed an issue with the "+ Fav" and "Note" buttons on submissions pages.
v0.1.3
	• Removed a thing in the theme's credits.
	• The theme now removes the mobile menu when you're on desktop.
	• Colored messages and SFW Toggle in the navbar.
v0.1.2
	• Tried adding a custom font.
v0.1.1
	• Fixed some bits here and there, styled the comission tab of the profiles.
v0.1.0
	• Initial Release, might've missed some bits, but it's functionnal.
