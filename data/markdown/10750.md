### Description
This code does one simple thing. It places the tabs on top of the adressbar, searchbar and so on, instead of having it beneath bookmarks.
It's a rebuild of the Tab bar on top of the window, like google chrome (http://userstyles.org/styles/10253) just done a bit smoother, if you ask me. 
It's build to the Firefox 3 default theme (Tango) and i cant promise it will fit other themes. The way you make it fit is simply by adjusting the 'window > padding-top'-value with the '.tabbrowser-strip > top'-value.

This css style applied together with the Hide Menubar extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/da/firefox/addon/4762) makes firefox just a bit more Chrome-like, but without the flaws that the Chromifox and Chrome Package has.
