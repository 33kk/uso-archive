### Description
A fluid high readability version designed for wide screen monitors with higher resolution.
Larger font, stretched to fill screen, dim and shrink the sidebar, minimize the breadcrumb bar, move the URL to the end and dim, and dim the article toolbar.

Sidebar has mouseover and breadcrumb has mouseover.

[Updated for new Digg style December 2007]
[Updated due to style change on digg.com on 6/28/08]
[Updated due to style change on digg.com on 7/1/09] Gray hard coded inline style? What were you thinking?
[Updated to remove fake digg submitions]  Great idea digg, too bad I hate all the sponsored companies, and I can only tolerate so much.
