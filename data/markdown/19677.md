### Description
Personal script that cuts out some superfluous elements on the last.fm site (in my opinion :) ). Basically this script removes some of the footer elements the top artists and top tracks (on user pages only, they still remain in the users charts page), and also makes the recently listened div scrollable so the page is generally not as long.

Any suggestions or critiques welcomed.
