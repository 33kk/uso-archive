### Description
Inspired by the no-longer-working <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/131938/hide-habitica-to-dos-column">Hide Habitica To-Dos Column</a>, except this one lets you hide any combination of columns you want! (Even all of them! ...But why would you want to do that?)

### Update notes
Update 2018-04-16: Okay so apparently the rewards option didn't have anything in it? 0_o But I remember testing that layout option and having it work. *X-Files theme plays*

By default, this hides to-dos and resizes remaining three columns to fill up a third of the page (like the style that inspired it). Doesn't hide columns on challenge pages or group pages, but that's intended so you know what you're getting into.
