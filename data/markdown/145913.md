### Description
[only for Waterfox/Firefox v56!!!]


Modern flat styled UI overhaul for Firefox without altering the original design language too much.
This theme is a fork of the "Firefox Edge (Light & Dark)" theme but with removed Edge Icons and Menus too keep the original Firefox look and feel.
Also a few additional adjustments were made.
Move the Water-/Firefox window arround after applying this theme to remove graphical glitches!
