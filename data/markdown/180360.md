### Description
A minimized Twitter interface with a motivation that lets you focus more on what people tweet and response with less judgments on their character.

<b>What this style does to your Twitter</b>
* Removes profile picture, because you don't wanna care what people look like
* Removes followings/followers count, because it adds nothing valuable in this society
* Removes unnecessary tabs and sidebar, because it's distracting
* Keeps you focus and avoid unnecessary simping over stupid tweets by a twitter thot

Found bugs and in need of improvements, <s>DM me @binatangberuk</s> No longer on Twitter. Snail mail me @ ctrlaltdel [at] cock [dot] li
