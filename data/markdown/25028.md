### Description
Makes the following changes:

- Display advanced options always.
- Images are actual size.
- Image box full height.
- Fixed position submit button.

If you're using the share bookmarklet with the popup window, you'll need to either edit it to enable scrolling or do so in your browser:

Mozilla and Firefox users can force this option to be always enabled for new windows by setting
dom.disable_window_open_feature.scrollbars
to true in about:config or in their user.js file.

Chrome users should be fine.
