### Description
Update: This is obsoleted by https://userstyles.org/styles/111851/xenforo-invisitext-handler which was based on this one and is more customizable, I recommend using that one, though this one still works fine. Leaving this up to not break links.



Because some people think making text <b>invisible</b> is a great way to hide spoilers, and I don't like reading the <i>page source</i> to see what they're saying.

### Update notes
Spamming this for the SV domain too so auto-finding it works. Almost exclusively only relevant to imported archived threads. It'll take effect for SB too, so no need to install both versions.
