### Description
<strong>I am officially discontinuing all my TweetDeck themes, so they may be outdated, but feel free to fork them (they now are into the public domain)!</strong>

This style needs to be used with the light theme of TweetDeck, otherwise it will be ugly !

This style is a new version of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/115599/light-tweetdeck-2-1-coco">this one</a> with a new design and new functionalities like a trending topics column at the right of the columns or new webkit scrollbars.
