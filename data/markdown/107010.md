### Description
No navigation bars, no edit buttons. 

All the content of the article.

### Update notes
Also hides:
- "Contents [hide]" text at the top of a page's contents section
- "From Wikipedia" text under an article's title
- The "powered by MediaWiki" and "a wikimedia project" badges at the very bottom of an article.
- disclaimer at the bottom of an article "Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply. By using this site, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a non-profit organization."
- The "Privacy policy About Wikipedia Disclaimers Contact Wikipedia Developers Mobile view" menu at the bottom of an article


Things that are NOT hidden:
- suggested articles, for example "See also: Japanese architecture" or "Main article: Late Tokugawa shogunate"
- article subject clarification for example "This article is about medieval fortifications. For other uses, see Castle (disambiguation)."
- footnotes
- lines under section titles
- icons after a link to another website
- the categories an article belongs to (bottom of article)
- content


Hidden if minimalist mode is turned on:
- Warnings, for example "This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (May 2011)"
- if the article is protected it will have a lock (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja for an example) or if it's featured on the front page it will have a little star in the top right. These are hidden.
- Links to the topic of an article on wikipedia's sister projects (bottom of the article)
- (help·info) links beside an audio file
Basically you wont notice it except, you wont see the warning if wikipedia considers some content bad (poorly researched, speculative, brand new, opinionated, etc). Look at the last 2 screen shots for minimalist mode off/on
