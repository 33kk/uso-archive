### Description
made for: reference.sitepoint.com\css

This style is meant for stylish authors and for web-based CSS development applications such as web hosting applications that run inside your browser. It is mainly useful within a sidebar such as Firefox's, which can be set as an option when you modify a previously created favorite (aka bookmark, hot-list item, etc).
