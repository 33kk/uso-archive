### Description
Emoh - God of the Rolling Chorus

Child of Magoria, the faceless god Emoh is blind and stalks through the night using the sound of his voice to guide him. He is the patron god of the darkness, caverns, thunder, and is often invoked in dark rituals requiring sacrifice.

This is a dark layout for D&D 5e OGL sheets on roll20, tweaked from the layout created by TwistedJackal ( https://userstyles.org/styles/151596/roll20-dark-matter ).

If anyone besides my own group stumbles upon this style for some reason, know that I don't have any levels in HTML Wizard, and I am simply trying to save my eyes.
