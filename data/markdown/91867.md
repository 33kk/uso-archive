### Description
This style aims to make navigating through the new Klei Entertainment's forums a more pleasant experience, by increasing contrast where it was too low, and decreasing it where it was too high.

Improvements on syntax highlighting are also included, based on KDE's palette for the Lua language.

Additionally, it fixes the issue where long signatures without whitespace don't break lines.

This version has no configurable parameters, using hardcoded colors.
