### Description
New Facebook Design! Way minimalistic!
Changes everything, from the profile page to the chat windows!
>Tested on Chrome, Firefox and Opera April 2016.<

### Update notes
<strong>This Style Includes:</strong>

- New top bar!
- Complete redesign of the profile page!
- Totaly redesigned "Messages Tab"
- New comments style
- Rounded avatars
- New chat style, with flat and elegant bubbles
- Minimalistic buttons!
- Custom font
- And more!

Hope you like it!

NOTE: This style includes the free usage font Roboto but don't worry, only applies to this particular style, so you will not have fonts conflicts with other styles installed, keep in mind that the font is compressed, so I can only ensure that it will display correctly in English, French, Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese (that doesn't mean it doesn't work with other lenguages, either way you can disable it if you want).
NOTE: Starting in the 2.0 version, this style suffer a considerable restyle, if you don't like it you can find the old one here <a>http://pastebin.com/2w7dZFTr</a>, but keep in mind that is outdated and might work poorly.
