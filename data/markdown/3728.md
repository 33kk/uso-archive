### Description
This Style uses Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color definition for the background color of the
Browsing Selected Tab and Non-selected Tabs.  You can experiment & change these 2 colors to your
preference.  This Style can be used in combination with style 4329 .
::
This Style was tested on Firefox 2.0 using its default theme "Firefox (default) 2.0".
Code starting point was style 2019 .
::
SOME DETAILS:
::
Firefox 2.0's default theme "Firefox (default) 2.0", automatically grades
the color vertically.  The color that you set in the code seems to be the color at the very bottom of the tab.
::
This Style does not have code related to hovering/mousing-over (nor related to the close-out button other
than the background surrounding it).  Note that with Firefox's default theme, hovering over a tab results in:
   - For the Selected Tab, all stays the same.
   - For a Non-selected Tab, all color becomes lighter.  (Its close-out button stays the same gray out
until directly hovered over.)
::
General Note:  For people who prefer setting colors as RGB, the existing code for any color in any Style
can be modified by using the format shown in this Style's code.
