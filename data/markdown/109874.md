### Description
This style removes certain but not all round corners, borders and background images from Memrise to achieve a cleaner, less cluttered look. The new goal settings are set to low opacity to be less distracting. The "Ready for watering" section was moved to the top for usability reasons. Feel free to modify the CSS!
