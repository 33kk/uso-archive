### Description
This basically just shrinks the (What I consider huge) menu bar (containing File, View, etc) to take up a lot less room. When coupled with small icons, this gives you a lot more viewing room.

UPDATE 6/03/10: Finally got around to making it look right. Now it's even smaller.

The theme that I'm using is NASA Night Launch, located here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4908
