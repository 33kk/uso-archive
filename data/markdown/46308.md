This Script is OUTDATED and discontinued!!!
==================================================

Another Gmail Attachment Icons style!

- This style use the system icons, so i do not provide any screens.
- It puts icons in inbox zone, inside mail and some in the new attachments zone!
- Supports 142 extensions types and 10 'gType' formats.

note: If you want some specific extension or 'gType' that is not present in this script please say something in the discussions. I will, probably, include your request in my next update!
ps: I may do this script from scratch again but I don't promise anything.
