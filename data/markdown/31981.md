### Description
Rejoice! I finally finished my Saira theme. :D
I couldn't really find any location in the game to base it on, so I decided to base it on the radio interface instead.
There are a few minor differences though. The radio in the game has a dark overlay on a lighter background while I have a lighter overlay on a darker background. I did that to get less contrast with the font, which is white instead of red.
Other than that, it's pretty much the same colors everywhere.

It's based on the WaDF theme, so you have to be using that (and stylish) for this theme to work.
