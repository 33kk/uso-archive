### Description
If 
<ul>
<li>you miss the classic YouTube logo</li>
<li>and/or YouTube Red is not available in your country, but you just want to have its logo</li>
<li>and you're using the "old YouTube" layout</li>
</ul>
then this userstyle is for you!

Click "Customise Settings" above to select the YouTube logo you want to have displayed.

### Update notes
IMPORTANT NOTE: This will ONLY change the YouTube logo in the top left of the page.

-----
EDIT 10/11/19: I now have YouTube Premium, and was able to update this userstyle to accommodate those. I also now include a Premium tag here!

Also, if you're on a Mozilla derivative web browser that doesn't support WebExtensions, like Pale Moon, consider using Stylem instead.
-----
EDIT 25/6/18: It seems that the website now tries to install individual WebExtensions for each userstyle, which leaves Mozilla derivatives that refuse to support that format (which I hate anyway) in the dark, so if you're using a Mozilla-based browser that lacks support for that format, like Pale Moon, and have to use the older Stylish 2.x, then you will need to go to the settings for that, click "Write New Style", and copy the contents of one of the following (not the entire page, just the content) into the large text area, then the title into the title, and save that.

I'm only providing the classic logos because I feel like doing so, so if you want the modern logos, do leave me a forum post (using the "Send Feedback" button at the bottom of the page), or if you don't want to sign up for an account here just to contact me, and have an account on Twitter or Reddit, you can contact me on one of those services, by sending a mention or private message to @kbhasi or u/MustardOrMayo404 respectively.

If you look carefully at the country guide indicator on the top right of the YouTube logo, I live in Singapore, where YouTube Red subscriptions are not available.

If you do live in a country where YouTube Red is available, then I recommend you actually pay for a subscription instead of just using this userstyle to add the logo.

Tested on Pale Moon 27.7.1 with Stylish 2.2.1

Options available:
Classic and modern ("de-tubed") logos, as well as regular and YouTube Red versions of both logos.
