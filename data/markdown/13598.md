### Description
I got fed up with the tabs on dA's new userpages floating to the left. This is just a small bit of code that sets it back to the right like in days of yore.

Note: This will only work for users who are currently beta testing. Once the new users pages are out of beta and it has been set as a site wide theme then anyone will be able to take advantage of it. Meaning, if you currently have the old school pages then there is no point in installing this style.
