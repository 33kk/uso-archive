### Description
A very clean theme for Pokémon Showdown with an evil Gengar staring right at you. The theme is Dark Mode friendly so feel free to adjust that in the Settings menu. *Image provided by P4ndo, be sure to check out the rest of his art @ https://p4ndo.deviantart.com/

*Added some tweaks from Pedro J. Miranda's theme as I really like the effects he added to the Default Pokémon Showdown*
