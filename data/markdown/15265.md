### Description
It is nearly impossible to tell what are links on the pear.php.net website. This CSS patch provides the fix for that plus some other enhancements.

•  Font-family "Arial" instead of "Verdana"
•  Links are underlined and blue
•  Visited links purple
•  Search field enlarged
•  Black headings instead of green
•  Horizontal rules removed under headings various places
•  400px bottom margin added so last line does not stick to bottom of screen

Changelog 2009-10-11
•  Style sheet should only apply to pear.php.net, not blog.pear.php.net
