### Description
This is based on the original "Fix the freaking new theme from /r/Python" userstyle that fixes up the python subreddit's design.  This one fixes up the terrible header and restores the left part of the logo to be a backlink to the reddit fontpage was with any other subreddit.

It also moves the search into the header and fixes some some stupid bugs in the icons.

I could not get the original icons and vote arrows back because they are too easy to break on reddit updates.
