### Description
Firefox 4 squared script, modified to look and work a bit better with the "MX3" Firefox theme.  All original credits go to "heartripper" for creating this nice script.
I just fixed the bugs with the tabs (not showing properly) and made the backgrounds of the buttons more consistent with the MX3 theme.

I have also released a new version that puts the stop/reload/go buttons on the left side: http://userstyles.org/styles/47524/ff4-squared-for-mx3-left-side-stop-reload-go

Original description:
"Revamp firefox 4's appearance with a squared look.

Please note that this is still a work in progress"
