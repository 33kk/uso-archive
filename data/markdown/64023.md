### Description
by <a href="/users/131844?per_page=50">grom</a>. Please READ!

Dark and blue <strong>color set</strong> for Wikipedia and it's sister sites, designed to be used <strong>together with a layout style</strong> (as in the posted screenshot). It works on it's own, but doesn't look quite as nice.

I recommend you add style 63573. Other layouts suggested below.

Enjoy!
