### Description
Lately, the Stylish popup's "Installed Styles" tab looks more like advertising than a user interface.

Nowhere is this more evident in that you have to hover … and … wait … for the enable/disable (and edit and delete) buttons to appear.

Also, the silly thumbnails are so huge that you can only see two or three styles at a time.
