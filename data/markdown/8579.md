### Description
This style removes some waste space in the original icon from 'Download Helper' firefox extension.

Thanks for your appreciate and nice comments.

I have to notice that this code removes the counter at the right of the icon, what it makes no difference to me.
I think the programmer of this extension has a very long screen... he doesnt mind about space.
