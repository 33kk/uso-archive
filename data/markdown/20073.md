### Description
A complete customisation sheet for the Rooster Teeth family of websites.

The default setup will make some pretty significant changes;
- Navigation bar follows the screen without using javascript.
- Some background images are stripped and spacings reduced. 
- Navbar buttons are restyled (customisable).
- Removes header and footer, and shrinks reserved space.

More significantly the sheet includes code to change most of the visible features of the website. By default these are deactivated, but basic settings for a black-based theme (based on the old RT Black theme) are included. It also includes the code fix from my other style.

Instructions on how to customise are included in comments in the sheet itself. Simply install the script and edit it from the Stylish menu. Alternatively, view source on this page and make your own copy. Feel free to upload customised versions.
