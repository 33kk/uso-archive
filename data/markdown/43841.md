### Description
Removes the right sidebar and expands main content of Gawker blogs.

Make sure you are using the "Classic view" mode.

I also have a companion theme that makes Gawker Media sites black: style 43904

If you want search functionality back, install the Gawker Media Sites Classic userscript made by me which you can find here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/96813

The userscript as also been updated, so make sure you update that as well.
