### Description
<b>Firefox 29 Update will follow!</b>

This is an addition to the original style style 44217 which is also made by me.

Huge thanks to user 169, his style inspired me to include this in my Style, some code is made by him.

Works with Firefox 15-25+ (i don't know if it works with versions below, but I'll update, if it doesn't work anymore)


On the Screenshot, i provided you can see the active window (darker one) and the not-active window version, above a white background. The strange button near to the X is caused by a seperate Program of mine, just ignore it :)
