### Description
It's all dark and good. Also removed some bright images made, re-enable them in Style Settings if the brightness doesn't matter for you.

### Update notes
The release was a mess because most of the theme didn't even exist. That is now fixed.

Working on:
- I haven't used Style Settings trying to replace text... will improve that next update.
- Kinda rushed, I'll try to improve the overall theme.
