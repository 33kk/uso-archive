### Description
This gives the option to remove the perspective (oblique/slant appearance) form the tiles in the new tab page when using <i>Louis Chan</i>'s <a href=https://www.louis.hk/whitefox/><i><b>Simple White</b></i></a> theme (or its variations) in <b>Firefox</b>.  It also gives the a choice to display smaller tiles in that page.  You can select from a list of progressively smaller tiles sizes with different aspect ratios.

### Update notes
The change in tile size may affect other <b>Firefox</b> themes besides <i><b>Simple White</b></i>, e.g., the <i><b>default</b></i> theme and <i>light themes</i>.  However it may or may not affect either of the tile dimensions (width and height) when used with other <i>complete themes</i> for <b>Firefox</b>.  
In the list of tile sizes the first three choices have the same width but they are progressively shorter in height.  The next set of three follows the same progression with a smaller fixed width.  The last two are progressively narrower.  The first choice is the default for <b>Firefox 40</b> and later, 290×210 px², setting the <i>default ratio</i> between 3:2, used often in photography, and 4:3, used for full screen movies and an old standard in computers.  The second value, <i>Golden Ratio</i>, is practically the default in <b>Firefox 39</b> and earlier, 290×180 px², (the value used, 290×169 px², is closer to the <i>Golden Ratio</i> = (1+√5)/2 ).  The <i>wide 16:9</i> ratio is the common widescreen aspect.
I personally use the smallest size that can fit the standard 15 tiles in a 1024×768 px² window. In the past I often used the small wide 16:9 tiles because they would fit a full screenshot, but only if it was taken when the I used Firefox in full screen mode.
The primary screenshot is with <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simplewhitex/><i><b>Simple White X</b></i></a> and the tiles choice is <i>Small / Golden Ratio</i>.  The next screenshot is with <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blue-evening-scene/><i><b>blue evening scene</b></i></a> and the tiles choice is <i>Smallest / Default Ratio</i>. Both were taken in a 1366×786 px² window.
