### Description
background borrowed from this dead theme -> http://userstyles.org/styles/48473/pokemon-tumblr

I got so tired of themes that barely do anything except add a background to your dash so I decided to make a more in-depth one, I hope you enjoy the result as I work on it in my free time and maintain it as tumblr updates their layout

Don't forget to check for updates, COMMENT/CONTACT/WHATEVER with any thoughts you may have

Known Issue(s):
Overlap issue makes tracked tags inaccessible (directly searching the tag still works, however)
Avatars for tag contributors/editors don't show up

Please note: I develop this theme in part with Google Chrome tools, and it's my browser of choice, so it might not look the same with Firefox/etc. But let me know if you have a problem and I'll see if there's something I can do
