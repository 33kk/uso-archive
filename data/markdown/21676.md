### Description
Sometime you find a site which you'd like to read. But it's written yellow on purple using 10px fonts with no defined column width. My screen is 1920px wide. Enable this stylesheet before you kill someone innocent...
It's a razor - don't catch it if you're not drowning. Enable temporary - while you're reading extremely ugly page. Don't claim it breaks good layouts - I know it.
