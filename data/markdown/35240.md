### Description
So here you go, Firefox 4 menu button in blue Windows Orb style known from Windows Vista and 7. ANIMATED thanks to CSS transition support in Firefox 4! See for yourself!

Also it moves tab bar up, so now it's in one line with menu button, in order to save some space in hard times of widescreen displays and netbooks.

Also improves appearance of drop-down list shown after clicking on URL bar to fit Windows Vista/7 style.

It took me several hours to understand how Firefox interface is bulit and to make my style as it is, so I hope you gyus enjoy. :)

PS. Read comments in style to modify style the way you like it!
