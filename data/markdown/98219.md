### Description
<strong>Flatty</strong> brings the flavour of the trendy <a href="http://flatuicolors.com/" target="_blank">Flat Ui Colors</a> to your  Google's Login Screen.

Google has changed the way users login to its services by serving a cleaner universal login screen. Google's most recent enhancements to its login mechanism has made it even better, however, I believe it has a lot room for improvements, so I decided to make it even cleaner and work with base colors from the flat ui palette to give it a fresh and fun look.

<strong>Now you can set your own colors and choose your logo instead of Google's</strong> \o/

Please take a look at the Changelog for tips and instructions. I hope you like it. Enjoy!

### Update notes
Changelog:

<strong><h3>Version: 1.4</h3></strong> >> Stable Release:
- Added subtle animation to the the sign-in box and the user's profile image on hover
- Added option so that users can choose their own colors and define a logo instead of google's.

Hint: If you choose to change Google's logo, please consider uploading your own logo to a cloud service such as <strong>dropbox</strong> which can serve your files through a ssl (https) secure connection. This will prevent you from getting browser security risk messages. Also, consider uploading a version of your logo with transparent background so that it has a proper contrast being over the colors you might choose. 

Here's a sample logo so that you can start with...the logo is white color with transparent background (png file):
