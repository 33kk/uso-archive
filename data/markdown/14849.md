### Description
Gmail Loading

This Userstyle will customize the Loading Page in Gmail. Display a neat black loading bar for 1024X768. For other screen sizes some tinkering in the code is needed on the 8th and 9th line. Send Thanks - ice続

Version 3.0

You can now change the color of the loading bar by tinkering with the 1pt pixel image under the Progress Bar heading. You can convert the colored pixel to base64 from within stylish. 

Version 4.0

The Progress Bar still works. Now you can tinker with the parameters, very simply. Write a Review - ice続
