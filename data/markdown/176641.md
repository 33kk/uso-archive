### Description
This is a simple dark (currently only Firefox, but it may work in other browsers.. untested) style for Patreon that displays the video on the video detail page at the full width of the layout. I apologize up front for this style being a little unorganized, redundant and generally hacked together. I mainly made it so I could watch tutorials next to an open app in the evenings without having to full screen the video or be blinded by the white page. I may make some tweaks here and there, but will not be supporting it formally. If anyone wants to modify this into their own version, feel free. 

Also, thanks to Entagma for posing for the poster image :)
