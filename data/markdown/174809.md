### Description
Some time ago I made this to fix some details on Twitch so now I decided to post it here.

* The video at Homepage is gone (nope, not possible to turn it off completely).
* Twitch Prime Blue Bar at Homepage is gone.  
* Video Screen is Bigger (made it around 99%).
* Theater Mode icon is gone, u just need to click at the video screen to enable it (it shows a different cursor now).
* Clip icon is now black and at a new position (I used to click on it accidentally all the time).
* Video Overlay shadow is gone (and some color changes).
* Everyone in Chat is RED (and some small letter spacing).
* Top bar redone, more clean and Prime/Bits icons are gone.
* Share icon is gone.
* Whispers icon is invisible, but don't worry, it still there, try it out!
* Top Cheerers Bar over the chat is invisible as well.
* Video Previews are bigger (Categories).

Eventually I add some changes so remember to update the Style and... FoLLoW Me On TwItCh LikE ComMeNt SuBsCriBe  >>> Twitch.tv/Dsiq
