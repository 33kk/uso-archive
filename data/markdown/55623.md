### Description
Firefox Better Add-on Bar/Status Bar works with all version of Firefox which implement the new awkward "Add-on" toolbar, which has always looked out of place to me, so I decided to make this stylesheet in order to feel comfortable with the add-on bar enabled and it not being so obtrusive.

Tested on:
Aurora
Nightly
Minefield
Firefox 7.x
Waterfox 7.x
Firefox 8.x

### Update notes
This userstyle should work on all Firefox versions which implement the "Add-on" toolbar, so Minefield, Aurora and Beta, even Waterfox.

Created by Jose Contreras (jcontreras{at}email{dot}com) free to use as you like, if you modify this userstyle you must let me know about it and request permission from me at my e-address to post it. Thank you!

If you have any problems with this style please post it here and I will do my best to fix them, this version compared to my older "minefield" version is completely re-written and tested for uniform and all menus should appear normally, you will not have any issues with things being out of place.

If you are happy with this userstyle, please consider donating me a buck or two for some coffee.
