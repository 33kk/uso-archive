### Description
[N.B. (2009-09-12) -- This style was nothing more than a trial-and-error hack. I don't use it any more (I leave the flickr photo pages as-is now), but I'd be grateful if people left comments in which they correct bits and pieces of the CSS that are wrong and/or out-of-date. At the moment, for putting a black background on flickr photo pages, I use a greasemonkey script that inserts a link under the photo to the bighugelabs.com/onblack.php web page script for that flickr photo page. Something similar must be possible for a gray background, but I've not made any time for it.]

I do not really like the white background and text colors of Flickr photo pages (the color schemes of other pages are less important).  Neutral gray makes a better background for most photographs.  This user style scratches that itch.

I'm a CSS beginner, and the modified selectors in this style have been discovered either through reading Flickr's own CSS files, or via Mozilla DOM inspector. I'm sure there are selectors missing and wrong selectors, as well as selectors which are too global. The resulting CSS is entirely ad-hoc. If you can do better, send me your own changes in keeping with these conservative modifications.
