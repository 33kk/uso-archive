### Description
<i>I am trying to remain the most current Google style available! I've figured out how to make it more friendly toward the use of dark images, so feel free to use whatever you like. If you still want to check out the other style that came before this, <a href=http://www.userstyles.org/76744>click here</a>.</i>

"Simple" may as well be an overstatement with how complicated the Google pages have become lately.

This style was created to address the issue of Google removing background images for all users. claiming incapability with their new software; Well, we know nothing is impossible with a little extra code, and this, like everything else on userstyles.org stands as a testament to that.

Find any image, then apply the image in the code, replacing the included stock image URL. Have fun with this style, and tweak it to your preferences.

<b>Problems? E-Mail me at bluufoxx.at.gmail/dot/com.
Do this to ensure I don't take another eon to revise this style!</b>
