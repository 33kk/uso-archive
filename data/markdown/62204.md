### Description
Totally transforms almost everything to dark with colourful elements.

Check back for updates, they won't install automatically.
Includes styles for the extensions: WebSearchPro, Stylish, Scriptish, DownloadHelper & Zotero.

### Update notes
Tested on Pale Moon.

Had to drop Firefox, Australis is dreadful.

Don't mix the colours, to easily change them use the tab button, and press the first letter of the colour you want. 

(The First background is inbuilt with Pale Moon, and won't preview. If using another image, I would recommend you save it to your hard drive, drag into a window, copy the URL from the address bar, then paste it into the code, between the speech marks, marked by TODO: 
This will save you from having to load the image every time you open a new tab.)

To look best. Go to Options > Status Bar Options > Show Links in: Pop up. 
Then, Right Click the tab bar, Uncheck Status Bar & Check tabs on top.

Best when used with:
style 62208
style 89295
style 65013
