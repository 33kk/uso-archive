From the looks of it on app.plex.tv, Plex might be switching to using fullscreen background images again. I'm making Plex Polished optional for https://app.plex.tv. The default will be "Off" in the preferences. I think this is a good default as this style should only effect your local instance of Plex web and not interfere with the online version.

Started to fix Plex Polished 4.0 to work with the new UNO styles. Full-screen background artwork should be working again.
*NOTE: Your browser needs to support "position: sticky" to work)

I know background images are not displaying with the latest update Version 3.104.2
I recommend disabling background artwork for the time being.

Removed transparency on header background

Fixed an issue with double borders when hovering photos in 3.20

*After spending a lot of time with the plex web app's html/css structure, it's clear to me that these guys don't have much previous experience in web application design. The amount amount of pointless or poorly designed elements is baffling. Point is, it"s no surprise that every release brings so many new bugs. They have an awful canvas upon which they're painting.

2017-08-19
Merged 3.17 styles with 3.14 styles for better parity

2017-08-12
wild-carded port 32400 so it applies, regardless which IP you use.
 
2017-08-06
Similar Artists play button was too big.

2017-08-05
Updated the styles in Summary view for greater contrast and to accentuate your star ratings. 

Note: It appears that the local version (http://127.0.0.1:32400/web/) and the online version (https://app.plex.tv) are using two different sets of React components and the classnames no longer align. I never use https://app.plex.tv so it doesn't bother me, but until they merge the codebase again, just expect some goofy stuff if you insist on using plex.tv.

2017-08-04
Fixed the double-zoom problem on photo library posters

2017-08-01
Fixed full-screen background, poster shadows, hover effects and play-button size.
*Note: There is some funky stuff that only effects the Photos section (that I know of). Should be fixed soon.
