### Description
The Agile Mail Update - Now in 3D!

This style has updates to better utilize screen real estate. Make sure you switch into threaded view (the button just to the left of the refresh wheel), the threaded view of notes is compressed to the practical minimum. The folder listing is shrunk allowing many more names to be shown.

The inbox listing is colored so unread, read, important, meetings, selected is very apparent, as they are intermingled.

In addition, it 'skins' all of Verse to be a more colorful. Occasionally, the original colors bleed through in a portion of the tool I haven't used and thus, haven't updated.

Overrides: the 'px' and '%' suffixes need to be there, don't remove them!

### Update notes
