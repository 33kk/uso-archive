### Description
Visually similar (I won't claim this is exact) to older versions of QuickJava - 1.7.5 is the last version to have this style I believe.

Also fixes a bug - Remove space left behind when a button is hidden.

A difference -

Font size in old QuickJava is set at 11px, the current version uses 8pt.  This style doesn't alter font-size value.
