### Description
BetterSearch is a fantastic Firefox addon, but it adds goodies to Google search results without regard for the filetype of that search result.

This style removes those elements that are inappropriate for that particular filetype (odt, pdf, etc).  For example, a "preview" of a .doc file will launch a download command (and NOT show a preview), but a preview of a pdf works just fine.

Enjoy!  ...and as always, please leave comments.
