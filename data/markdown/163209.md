<ul>
<li>• This is my own personal site style that I maintain for fun, and that I've uploaded here since I thought others might enjoy it. You are free to do whatever you want with it including reskin it to your own tastes or use it as a base for your own Furvilla site theme; all I ask is that you leave a link to this style and to FV Battling somewhere in the description.</li>
<li>• This style does not affect user profiles or villager profiles by default (aside from hiding ads). If you want to change this, all you have to do is <a href="https://i.postimg.cc/gJBhgzKM/fv-uncheckme.png" target="_blank">disable custom css in your user settings onsite</a> and change the first code block's REGEXP (the long string at the bottom that says 'applies to') from <b>(http|https)://www\.furvilla\.com/(?!(villager/[0-9]*(?:\?|$)|profile/[0-9]*(?:\?|$))).*</b> to <b>(http|https)://www\.furvilla\.com/.*</b> (<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/0jDYW6y8/fv-regexp-instructions.png">visual instructions</a>)</li>
<li>• <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JfGfv8S30kFT2KNjxxOe8d4_akIbHlNkcNgVDzaHIcg/">Report Bugs Here</a></li>
<li>• User forum style colors are overwritten, but the font size/weight are still user-defined.</li>
<li>• You need to have an active villager set in order for the extra 10 villagers to be condensed down into 2 villagers + careers per row. Without an active villager, it'll just display like the site default.</li>
<li>• Image assets are hosted on PostImage, and the full changelog is hosted on Paste.ee</li>

<b><i>Compatibility:</i></b>
<ul>
<li><b>YES:</b>
• <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/168524/fv-speed-eating" target="_blank">Furvilla Speed Eating</a>
• CuteHornyUnicorn's WYSIWYG editor
• The price checker userscript
• <a href="https://pastebin.com/F4ErFPTg">FVToolkit-Sidebar (Right Column)</a>, my modification of FVToolkit-Sidebar that adds more villagers to the 'More Villagers' widget in the sidebar. You need an active villager set in order for it to function properly, and can change the # of villagers shown on the sidebar by editing the labeled number in the code.
</li>
<li><b>NO:</b>
• FV Battling
• FVToolkit-Sidebar
• FV Nightmode Redesigned
</li>
</ul>

<b><i>Credits:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>• The battle code is largely inspired by and contains elements from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/142352/fv-battling">FV Battling userstyle</a>. (I made part of its code a part of this style due to the fact that the original style's code doesn't work with how this style changes the site layout; it needed significant editing in order to not break the battle page.)</li>
<li>• Code for the background animations is from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/131007/fv-nightmode-redesigned">FV Nightmode Redesigned</a></li>
<li>• Color theme is largely inspired by FV Nightmode Redesigned</li>
<li>• Custom image assets used in the style are hosted on PostImage, and the full changelog is available on pastebin.</li>
