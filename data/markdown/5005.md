### Description
This style hides all elements of the site except the post cells with the header and the image and the page navigation and total post/page bar at the top and the page navigation and search form at the bottom.

I know it's a terrible mess and will probably break if they ever redesign the site again, but its a quick hack and does its job. I didn't exactly enjoy writing it, but i was too irritated by the huge header of the site (its 1 screenful here before the first post starts). Feel free to hack it or use the bits you can use for anything else.

[update 2008-04-20 : rewritten to work with "mb3" (sorry haven't visited mb for some time so maybe the old one was inoperable for a longer time..)]
[update 2008-04-25 : inclusion instead of exclusion in top level (=smaller), also automatically ignores the random new stuff in the header they include]
[update 2008-08-31 : forgot to upload the latest changes and only noticed on a new machine - so here is it fixed (for now...)]
