### Description
<b>Google appears to have removed favicons for some users, so the customization setting can be ignored if you are included in that group. They may experiment with favicon placement for some users, but I am not in that group so I can't test how this style is affected. Your mileage may vary.</b>

Google changed their web search results and the new design is fairly ugly in my opinion, so I wrote this to fix it.

•Puts the page title back above the page URL
•Makes the text and dropdown arrow green again
•Condenses the page title/URL text to take up less space
•<s>Centers the URL text vertically to the favicon</s>
•<s>Favicon is kept by default, but is removable with "Customize Settings" above</s>

<b>Made and tested with Stylus in Firefox.</b>
Let me know if there are any issues!
