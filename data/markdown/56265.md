### Description
ATTENTION!!!
This Script is OUTDATED and discontinued!!!
==================================================

I made this Script with 2 points in my mind...
- 1st = As a complement for various of my other scripts where i had this very same code.
- 2nd = Try to put the newest Google top nav bar much more smaller in all the places where it appears.

Notes:
The 1st point it will be 100% satisfied in time!
The 2nd point i can't verify with 100% certain... If your domain is not covered please report-it to me in the discussions and i will try to add it in the next update.
