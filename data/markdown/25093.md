### Description
NOT FINISHED. I uploaded to share my tiny progress and to have a place to put it when it's finished.

For the newest Facebook redesign (as of Wed, Feb 10, 2010)!

Makes Facebook's sidebar and header stay fixed to the page while the rest of the content scrolls. Allows you to get to the sidebar and controls no matter how far down the page you're scrolled.
