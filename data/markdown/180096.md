### Description
I made this thing years ago after tumblr removed blockquotes, and never really thought to post it. But a friend wanted it, so I figured I should make it available to everyone.

Quick summary of what this does:
- Indicates new additions to posts and grays out inactive blogs.
- Rearranges posts to be more condensed.
- Hides ads and suggestions

I personally use this alongside a pretty basic XKit setup, but it seems to work the same with or without XKit.
