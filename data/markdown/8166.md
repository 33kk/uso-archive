### Description
"Light" version of Luc's Yahoogroups style hack. Removes all images, ads, footer and most of the header. Also changes colors and font sizes.

See also my style 8175, with rounded corners.

To do: this is my very first attempt; need to make it cleaner and more consistent.
To do: alternative color schemes for people who have no clue about CSS editing.
