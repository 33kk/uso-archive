### Description
Based on outlook-web-access-simplified (http://userstyles.org/styles/35802/outlook-web-access-simplified) by wink (http://userstyles.org/users/18413) - extending it to include some of the CSS browser reset magic from here: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ and further enhancements to the user interface in an attempt to make it more usable and look a bit better than the stock webpage.

Editing required in order to make it specific to your Outlook Web Access URL.
