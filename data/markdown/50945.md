### Description
Turns most of the blue stuff in the "IHerdULikeEmMudkipz" theme green. Gotta be using the IHerdULikeEmMudkipz theme for it to look right.

### Update notes
It was suggested that I should have used a bulbasaur instead of a recolored mudkip. Well I like the recolored mudkip but I went ahead an added the option to have it as a bulbasaur instead.

10/30/2013 - Fixed little breaks that showed up over the years.
