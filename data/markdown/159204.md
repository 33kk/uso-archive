### Description
After coming across this amazing image online (Artist Unknown?) it reminded me of an old PO Ho-Oh Theme that I found on the Serebii Forums years ago. So I decided to revamp it for PS, kind of a tribute to one of best Legendary Pokémon in the game...

*Added some tweaks from Pedro J. Miranda's theme as I really like the effects he added to the Default Pokémon Showdown*

### Update notes
