### Description
A dark cinematic theme with fade-ins, keeping the video the most important part of your YouTube experience.

Has many options to allow for a personalized video size, color, opacity, etc.

### Update notes
This theme was designed primarily for the purpose of watching videos. As such, it hides the "recommended videos" section. It's at the end of the video, anyway. Keep it simple.

Let me know what other features you might have in mind for this theme, and be sure to let me know if you're experiencing bugs (please attempt to troubleshoot first, though).

Please rate, as well. I'd appreciate it.

I want this theme to be relatively simple, but feel free to tell me what you guys wanna see.
