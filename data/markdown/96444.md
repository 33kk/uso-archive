### Description
Makes the StackExchange chat look the way <em>you</em> want it to. Includes SE chat, MSO chat and SO chat.

### Update notes
Should work fine out of the box for most rooms. I'm aware that some of the rooms don't work, and I'm trying to fix it. Feel free to suggest improvements or even make your own version.
