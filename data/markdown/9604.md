### Description
just de-craps photobucket.
Photobucket used to be the BEST image host, now it's just crap...
Because it's cluttered.
This gets rid of all the shit.
Remember to go to account options and get rid of all the options except direct urls - if you need the website to give you the code for the image, then stop being a lazy c-nut and just learn the 6 letters...

Please note - that this script will get rid of most of photobuckets features.
If you use features like, mobile upload, email uploads or photobucket apps - then dont installt he script.
If you want to use the image host... as an image host - then do install this...

Although honestly - tinypic will still always be my favourite now.
