### Description
I think that new Gaia layout is pretty (yeah! i love it!) but not perfect.

I hate that standard blue/purple links ("Logout", amount of Gaia Cash and my Messages) in header that don't fit to anything so i changed it. I also tried to do something with New Message notification to make it more noticeable (i did a blue background-maybe it helps).

Enjoy [;
