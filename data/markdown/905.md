### Description
replace #main-menubar texts with icons (only)
written with normal icons (not small) you'll have to change the margin values (maybe...)
works > 2.0b2 ]
edited with base64 img

@Paulfox : thanks, I've had the same problem ant can't fit it through css, 
as you can see, the original icons are 16x16 from Human. the only soluce I've found was to create a 24x24 transparent and to paste the 16x16 in !
I hope that's clear. sorry for my english
