### Description
Complete with support for common syntax highlights. Up-to-date & Removes ads!
Also supports <b>deals</b>.pastebin.com(mostly)!

### Update notes
Version 2.7 - 15/Nov/2019
Please let me know if there's something more you want or if you want something to change; create a discussion!
I haven't supported ALL syntax highlights, because there's over 250 options for syntax and every single one requires 5-10 unique CSS edits each which is an insane amount of work, and would not even fit within the size limitations here. So, I would love to hear from you which ones you use the most so I can prioritize the most common syntax.
