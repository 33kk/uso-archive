### Description
merfy's original HabitRPG theme — a few tweaks to make <a href=https://habitrpg.com/>HabitRPG</a> cleaner, more compact, and more exciting.

Personally though, I think its successor, style 101273, is even better :)

Features: <ul>
<li>New fantasy header!</li>
<li>Tasks take up less room, allowing you to view more at a time. </li>
<li>More room for task titles, further contributing to displaying as many as possible.</li>
<li>New navigation bar with buttons grouped closer together for easy access.</li>
<li>Completed tasks are hidden so you can focus on what you need to do.</li>
<li>Busy icons/buttons removed.</li>
<li>Paper-texture background is easier on the eyes than stark white.</li>
<li>Chat bubbles in Tavern Chat.</li>
<li>A few surprises — keep an eye on your avatar ;) </li>
<li>Lots of little tweaks here and there — try it out!</li>

### Update notes
Please note that this theme hides some infrequently-used buttons.  If you need to access them, you can either remove that part of the code, or disable the style when you need to change something!

Feel free to modify it as you wish!
