### Description
This script applies minor changes to fine-tune the text format of the Google search results.

Updated: September 22, 2008

The script does the following:
- Text layout and wrapping are improved to work especially better with GooglePreview FF extension
- Font is changed to Verdana, Geneva or Kalimati (I think they look much better than Arial)
- Slightly larger font size for titles and increased line height for the rest of the text
- Few pixels padding to allow a little more space around the text
- Removed underline decoration from links other than titles
- On mouse hover, links are underlined and text color turns orange

Tested on 1024x786 resolution. Tested for compatibility with CustomizeGoogle, GooglePreview, and StumbleUpon extensions.
