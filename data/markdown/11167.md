### Description
This is yet another quick fix for a stupid design mistake in about.com forums. In thread display, the title of the thread displayed at the top of the message list will be larger than it used to be; on some systems it is so large it may break the layout if the title becomes long enough. The HTML responsible for this is so silly you have to look at it yourself to believe it.

In any case, this work-around sets the size back to 10px as it used to be. You can of course use a different value if you want to.

Should the programmers responsible ever get their senses back and re-program this 'feature' this hack should become obsolete as the h2 tag isn't used anywhere else.
