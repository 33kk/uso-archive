### Description
This style only displays correctly when the Noia 2.0 eXtreme Firefox theme is installed.  I use the dark version of the Noia theme, which turns the menu bar and toolbars black.  To use this version, install the Noia 2.0 theme, open the Firefox add-ons manager, go to Themes, right-click on the Noia 2.0 theme, and select Dark Noia theme. 

You may need to adjust the margin for "#editBookmarkPanel { margin-left: 750px !important; }" listed at the very beginning of the style, for your monitor size.

Awesome/location and search bar mods:

1. Shades bars until hovered over or selected
2. Removes feed button, star button, and autocomplete dropmarker from awesome/location bar
3. Removes go button from search bar
4. Shrinks and changes look of autocomplete drop down menu tree rows to dark black (using Noia 2.0 eXtreme theme graphic) with white text
5. Highlights text and border of rows in blue when selected (note: blue borders don't show up well in below pic)
6. Prevents urls, tags, and bookmark icon from displaying in tree rows
7. Removes scroll bar from autocomplete drop down menu

Updates:
12/12/08 -- Fixed bottom border of last cell, so it shows.
12/16/08 -- Changed font size for drop down rows.
12/19/08 -- Improved style of search bar drop down menu. Removed line of code that only displays bookmarks in Awesome bar drop down 
                    menu. Removed border from searchbar drop down menu panel.
1/31/09 -- Altered bars so they are shaded at different levels depending on whether they are dormant, hovered over, and focused on. Similar 
                  to IE. Also addressed minor fix to padding of text in search bar dropdown results.
2/1/09 -- Fixed issue with "bookmark this page" dialog box not showing. Used a different approach to address "bookmark this page" dialog 
               box. You may need to adjust the margin for "#editBookmarkPanel { margin-left: 750px !important; }" at the very bottom of the style, 
               for your monitor size.  Make sure that you do set a margin, or the "bookmark this page" dialog box will dissappear.
3/23/09 -- Changed font color and shading of url and address bars when focused.
3/24/09 -- Changed font of url and address bars to verdana
4/24/09 -- Add customizations for Searchery add-on
6/12/09 -- Transitioned to new url bar background gradient. Made the gradient a bit darker. Fixed text selection colors and incidentally added focus to the bar when focused.
6/18/09 -- Fixed one of the left end caps
11/18/09 -- Cleaned up code a bit.
2/3/09 -- Removed "feeds" button, which also removed a transparent line that was showing at the end of the location bar
