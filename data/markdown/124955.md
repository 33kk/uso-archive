### Description
I tried to make a low glare low contrast skin while maintaining readability that would be good for blogging at night or when the lights are dim. Ace colors so minimal blue spectrum light to reduce eye strain as much as possible. Will be updating to work out the kinks as time allows.

Disclaimer- I have no idea what I'm doing.
