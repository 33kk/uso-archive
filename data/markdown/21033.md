### Description
This is the same as my other userstyle ( http://userstyles.org/styles/19135 )without the added shading for the Hide caption option.

With the release of FF 3.5 I found I had to quickly redo my custom Windows 7 FF theme and make use of the ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12181)  "All-Glass" extension instead of ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7336 )"Glasser". The trouble was that the All-Glass extension made reading menus and tabs quite difficult when used with the 'Hide Caption" add-on ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9256 ) that I also use, so I applied various fixes from various other mods I have accumulated over the years to this script in an attempt to make it work the way I wanted. So I thought i'd upload it to help out until something better comes along. Code credit goes to the original authors, whoever they are (unfortunately I never kept the comments in my script as I prefer to keep it clean and never intended to release it. The only way I could work out who made wait is to trace back every bit of code ive ever used and modified. So if ive used your code, please let me know and ill add a comment to the script)

*note*
The spacing of the bookmarks can be adjusted easily (so can most things). Currently it's set to suit my screen res and bookmarks.
The custom combined buttons arent included, but those are from the MBlue (http://userstyles.org/users/11968 ) series of mods.

Updated to include minor fixes to findbar, tabbar background and tab transparency.

Another update to fix some font issues. Also decided to tint the whole FF window (every toolbar), as i believe it fits better with the glass effect and looks more polished. All the original code is still there, just commented out, so feel free to adjust it.
There is also a Vista style bookmarks bar in the code which is also commented out.
