### Description
The Delaware Home Access Center (HAC) is one of the most-visited websites by Delaware K12 students, because it allows students to see their assignments and class grade in real-time as educators update them.

Through a collaborative effort between my friend Ashish and I, we have created an alternate dark theme that is based off of the Google Material Design guidelines.
