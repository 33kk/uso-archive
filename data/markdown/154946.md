### Description
This theme is based on Bejamin Bagley's excellent "Jira Dark Flat" theme.  Benjamin's theme is the best I'd found yet, but it leaves a few elements in Bitbucket and JIRA with a white background, and it doesn't retain the custom header color defined on my JIRA server.  This theme corrects both of those behaviors.
