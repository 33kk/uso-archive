### Description
For Firefox 8+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This style is an attempt of restoring Fx7 navigation toolbar buttons appearance in Small Icons mode that was removed due to: Bug 671553-Remove the navigation toolbar's custom button appearance in small icons mode/invert icons on dark personas and glass.

Note: Some buttons may not appear exactly has they did on Fx7.

Works well with userstyle:
style 60116

<b>*Important*</b> It should work without problems, but it may clash with some Add-ons or other CSS code or userstyles out there. This userstyle is a work in progress and isn't yet complete, so if you do find a style bug that you can reproduce with no Add-ons or no other userstyles installed or enabled please use the "No Rating" Discussions option when reporting any style bugs for the time being.

Tested on Firefox 8+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora builds, Nightly builds.
