### Description
Removes the Site Identity Button from Firefox 3's Awesome Bar (Locationbar).  Gives you more room to type in that long URL, or to search using the Awesomebar.
The Site Identity Button icon displays the Favicon of the current site, and when clicked, it brings up Firefox's new Passport Information.  This gives you advanced information about a website, and if any security breaches are occuring.


Integrates with Style 7169.

Additional Information:
This style works only on the new Firefox 3 browser.
Gives you more space in the Firefox 3 Awesome Bar (found on the Navigation Toolbar)

Warning:
- It is not 'advised' that you remove this button, as it is part of Firefox 3's new Security system.  Please refer to < http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Site+Identity+Button > for more detailed information.

Changelog:
- Initial Release
