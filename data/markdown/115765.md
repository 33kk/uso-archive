### Description
This style provides tweaks the style made by user 288169, which can be found here: style 111979.
I used this style, and I liked it, but felt it lacked some features. Some elements weren't skinned and others could use improvement. This skin is meant as an extension to that style.

<b>Please remember that you need user 288169's style! This won't work without!</b>
