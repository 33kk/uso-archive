You can view the main website at: http://playmidnight.com/
Or download the Chrome extension directly here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ljmjmhjkcgfmfdhgplikncgndbdeckci

### Update notes
To change the color options for Play Midnight, click the Play Midnight cog located on the bottom right corner of your screen. If you disabled the Fab icon, you can get to your settings by opening the left sidebar and scrolling to the bottom, near the Play Music settings.

Note about the Mini Player: The mini player uses a separate app/program on your computer separate from Chrome, so I don't have any way of styling it at the moment, sadly. If I eventually have the time to figure it out I'll get on it.

Feel free to tell me any things you like or dislike as well as graphical changes and I'll take everything into consideration. Thanks for trying out Play Midnight, and I hope you enjoy!
