### Description
Simply put: it removes the Explore tab (mainstream media/controversies) and "trending" now on the right hand side.

If you want to block out all the political noise, here you go. If something BIG was *actually* going on, someone you follow is going to engage. You'll see it.

<small>I think the trending hashtags that make it to trending are unintentionally getting bigger from the replies criticising such tags. It's probably how a trending tag correlating to a recent event can stay on 1K tweets for hours on end for an entire country. I still find it suspiciously selective either way.</small>
