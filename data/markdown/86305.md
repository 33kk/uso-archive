### Description
Scales down images inserted by users in their posts on intjforum.com to selected maximum width and height.

* Added scaling down of images in visitor messages, defaults to 3/4 of post image limit. Edit to your liking.

* Added scaling down of images in private messages as for some odd reason of CSS/FF/what ever, it wasn't working there.

* Updated and added resizing of profile avatar to the default value since every time they play with template this gets messed up, so not anymore if you use this :)

Aspect ratio is kept of course. And it only scales down images bigger than the selected value. It does not scale up smaller images.

### Update notes
In User CP - The Image Resizer, revert back to older "Keep original size" to disable forum's new built in image scale down. This new forum's scale down breaks user links on images and makes links impossible to follow when they are put on images or images and text.

Affects smileys as well as they are basically user images for the forum.
Spoilers work fine.

Enjoy.
