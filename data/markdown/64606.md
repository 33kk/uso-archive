### Description
The focus of the theme is to have a discreet dark background and elegant text fonts to put the spotlight and most focus on the video itself and enjoy it in native 720p player size without any scaling, therefore best video quality. Best to use on <b>1080p</b> monitors.

The 720p style from Dykam was slightly improved to automatically load at 720p and stretch the palyer to native 720p. Select medium player size <b>once</b> to activate it.


I also recommend this FF addon for YT to download flash videos: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/flash-video-downloader-youtube/
