### Description
A stylesheet to make Haiku easier to read and more user-oriented. The design removes some intrusive elements which don't provide a lot of benefit.

Meant to be used with my User Script as well. (Will be posted soon)

Feel free to send me an email at matthaikustylish@gmail.com if you have any problems or suggestions.

Changes: 
-No more "7 classes not shown"
-Made the Homework section more prominent
-Removed a lot of useless information

Please Note: This extension is in no way associated with "The Service," Haiku Learning, or any other Haiku Learning service.
