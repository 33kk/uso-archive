### Description
Tools to allow you to customize the colors of your posts and your quoted posts, as well as customizing post text and a fixed width attribute

BE SURE TO ENTER YOUR USERNAME INTO THE URL FIELD BEFORE INSTALLING (ignore upload/browse field)

### Update notes
The default settings are my personal settings, designed to work with the dark theme and to not be too intrusive while still being plainly obvious - a slightly darker box with a bright orange outline, and an orange username

You can change this to whatever you want by editing the CSS at any time or using the optional install tools above to make sure it looks best to you.

v1.1
Added Font, Text Size, and Max Width options
