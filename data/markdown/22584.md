### Description
The script is actually a rip off of style 3958 , with minor changes and additions. The icons used in this script (edited and unedited) are from Google's.

NOTE: 
* Not all file types will have their own icons yet including programming files. All of them will share generic icon which is typically unknown file.
* This script was tried and tested using Google Chrome. And it's running fine.

v0.50 : 3/24/2010 Added support for browser extensions, bookmarks file, vCard, and generic icon for unsupported files
v0.45 : Added support for photos imported from digicams (ex. Sony, Canon) and mobile phone, through scanning the filename.
v0.30 : Added support for most common file types shared: Compressed folders, Office programs, some propriety files (pdf), music, videos, images, etc.

Did I miss something? Is this feeling buggy? Got a better edited icon? Reactions? Share it here.
