### Description
A very minimal style which replaces the orange Firefox button with a small, semitransparent, Windows 7-style button to match the window controls on the right hand side.

UPDATED: Now works with Classic Theme Restorer extension for Australis. Open the extension's Options page and under Application Button, choose 'Button on titlebar'.

This style is active in windowed and maximized mode.  When the window is not in focus, it changes to look empty, like the window controls do.  On hover, the button glows orange.

Feedback is always welcome!
