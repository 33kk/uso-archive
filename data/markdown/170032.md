### Description
<b>Fixes a bunch of things wrong with Fade++</b>
<i>Meant to be used alongside <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/164470/fade-for-youtube">Fade++</a> obviously</i>

- Adds the container background for the videos on the subscriptions page (like on the homepage)
- Fixes the playlist page
- Improvements to the video page 
       ├- Removed a -20px margin on the primary container. Should properly center now.
       └- Added proper handling for different size windows. There were missing margin rules etc.

Some of these changes attempt to override Fade++ !important rules with my own !important rules. So my rules need to be loaded into the DOM first. As far as I know the order the styles are installed determines the load order. i.e. You might need to install this style first, then Fade++
