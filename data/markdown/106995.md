### Description
These bioluminescent jellyfish on black square backgrounds with rounded corners post icons will work with any dashboard theme, but look best on a white post container. If you want something about these post icons customized to your tastes or have a request msg me <a href="http://www.eatyourheirs.tumblr.com"?@eatyourheirs</a> for personalized assistance.

### Update notes
Comes with two different animation styles.* 
The shaking animation uses webkit animation coding as opposed to moz so it will not work on firefox.
