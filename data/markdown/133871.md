### Description
NOTE: Must use classic layout of YouTube for this to work!

A theme that simplifies YouTube. 

The homepage is now uncluttered by "Recommended Videos" and "Recommended Channels" that seek to distract and waste your time, instead, the website is toned down to the point where it resembles google.com. 

When watching videos, the sidebar on the right that shows related videos is removed, the focus is now on the video you are watching. 

Videos are intended to be watched in Theater Mode only.
