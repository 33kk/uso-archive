### Description
This style will remove the ads which is shown in the articles of all large IDG.se sites (Macworld, PC For Alla, InternetWorld etc.). I thought these ads were pretty annoying, because they disturbed your reading of the article quite much. The ads on the left are also removed.
The style will also add a small break between the intro and the main article, for more effective reading.
