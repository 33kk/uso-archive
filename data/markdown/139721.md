### Description
Make sure you set your instance by pressing <b>"Customize Settings"</b> above, if you are not on mastodon.social!

To handle more than one instance, you will need to install this and then edit it. Instructions are inside the CSS.

Based on <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/134746/mastodon-wide">Mastodon Wide</a>, but scales with browser's width. Should be safe to mix with other styles. Contact <a href="https://cute.science/siina">@siina@cute.science</a> if you have any questions, comments, or concerns!

### Update notes
Supports Mastodon front-end and Glitch-soc front end.

Add your instance in the Style Settings!

The drawer (column where you type) can be adjusted:
* Default (same as every column)
* Narrow (narrow like original Mastodon)
