### Description
heavily tweaked v1 http://userstyles.org/styles/3730

changes:
- added  bottom fixed page list
- added support for google image search 

inappropriate to use in resolution below 1280x1024 [i think] because in 640x480 [tested] top links overplace on each other.
optimal resolution is 1680x or 1600x

i can't post the screenshot, 

in css there is probably some ugly code because i haven't enough time to finish it
