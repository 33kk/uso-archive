### Description
There are a lot of services that allow you to show tweets at an event on a monitor or projector, but most of those services are limited in text size and do not include photos. Using tweetdeck with this style you can customize the size of the text and the size of the photos/videos and the size of the grid of photos.

Use maximum settings in the tweetdeck for text and images (see screenshots).
