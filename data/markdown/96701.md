### Description
A script made to redesign the look of NyaaTorrents (currently nyaa.se), making it darker and flatter than the original. It completely transforms the original design and adds what I believe looks better and cleaner.
I'm new to CSS and scripting in general, so this script is full of weird methods and shoddy workarounds. It was a learn along the way type deal, so I'm sorry if there are any problems or stupid things about it.

### Update notes
Version: 1.0.

To fix some text in the Torrent Description pages, please
install this userscript:

    http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/187629

To get the Open Sans Font used in this style:

General Info:

- Optimized for Firefox on a 1920x1080 display.
   *It should still work on Chrome, but it will probably
    have spacing and alignment problems.

- The Segoe UI Font or the Open Sans are the preferred
  fonts for this script.
   *Other fonts will also probably mess with spacing.
   *The Segoe UI Font is only for Windows, but Open Sans
    can be downloaded and installed regularly.
