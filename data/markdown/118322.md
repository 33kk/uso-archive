### Description
With this you can set certain specific colored labels to be full width. How? Just name them "wide" (or any custom name, set by you before installation), and they will automatically be full width. Like the orange label in the screenshot.

### Update notes
<em>Can I use a custom name, instead of "wide"?</em>

Yes. If you rather want to define your own custom name for your full width labels, choose that name above BEFORE installing it - for example "full", "full width", "OMG", "separator", "line", "i love abba",... You can only use one name.

<em>How do I actually name a label on my board?</em>

Click on a card (or on the little crayon icon on a card), click on Labels (or Edit labels), click on the little crayon next to the label that you want to name/rename, give it the name "wide" (or your custom name if you have defined one during installation), click Save.

<em>What if I want to have ALL my labels full width? That could be fun.</em>
