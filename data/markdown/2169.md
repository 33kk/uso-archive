### Description
Revamped version of userstyles.org. It maintains the original look of the webpage and it's aimed at those who code styles (but not necessarily only to them).

Please notice that this style integrates both style 1499 by user 12 and style 1460 by user 41, as clearly stated, all credit for these goes completely to them.

I'm working on a new version for this style.

You may also be interested in this style: style 8091

Add these, if you wish, at the end of the code:

1) To see the main lists in three columns instead of two (Recommend for 1024x768 or bigger resolutions):

/* splits main lists into three columns */
@-moz-document url(http://userstyles.org/style/list/site), url(http://userstyles.org/style/list/app), url(http://userstyles.org/style/list/global) {#style-list {-moz-column-count: 3 !important;}}

2) To hide google ads:

/* hides google ads */
@-moz-document domain(userstyles.org) {iframe[name="google_ads_frame"] {display: none !important;} }
