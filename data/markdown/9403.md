### Description
This puts the search back on the right, and makes the search colors look like they did when V6 was first released, mostly.  I added a few minor touches to how the dropdown looks.  This also gets rid of the Subscribed link, since I've never found a use for that.  And it colors the links at the top so they're not so bright.
