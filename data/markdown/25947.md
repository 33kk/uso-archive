### Description
A few modifications to the tab bar and tabs:
∙ Round upper corners on tabs get wider radius
∙ The tabs get a "highlight" underneath when you hover over them.
∙ The hover-color is easily customized, so you can match your theme/ Persona. 
∙ Type "scheme" into the Stylish editor's Find bar to find the place where you can change it.

A good reference for CSS color names is here: <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colornames.asp>

Your results may vary, depending on your theme, or the Persona your Firefox is "wearing"...
Just keep trying out colors until you get a good match.
