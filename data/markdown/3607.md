### Description
This style will only provide support for Google.com and it's various sites as well. As with all of my styles, these are also very dark (mostly black)!

You should now also separately install my Wikipedia DeepPurple Molecular Sidebar (http://userstyles.org/styles/3608), so as to properly render the molecular images on Wikipedia.
