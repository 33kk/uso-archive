### Description
Inverse Crunchbang Forums Userstyle
by Tunafish
21-11-2010

On 20/11/2010 the Crunchbang Forum changed to a dark theme. Beautiful, but hard to read for some.
This userstyle changes parts of the forum back to a light theme.

No need for this userstyle anymore, as the forums now have a 'lightswitch' to change the theme from dark to light.

Please feel free to alter and post your code on the Crunchbang Linux Forum
