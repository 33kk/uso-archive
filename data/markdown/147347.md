### Description
<p>Youtube hit us with a new update not long ago and as always people have mixed feelings about it. One thing I saw people commenting on is the new color. They changed not only the logo/ logotype and the layout, the color also went from a dark red to a light brighter red, across the entire website. </p>

<p>This is a 5-minute solution and far from a ‘perfect fix’, so that means you have to deal with some things not working 100%. If you find that I have missed something or that something look weird, please send me a message and I will take a look at it and I'll do my best to update the code. 
</p>
<p>
Parts targeted by this style:<br>
<ul>
<li>Icons in the sidebar</li>
<li>Logo in the top left corner</li>
<li>Video Player Progress bar</li>
<li>Subscribe Buttons on main page, under videos and on channel pages</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This is for the new Youtube Design and not the old one.
