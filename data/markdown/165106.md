### Description
For those of you ready <u>to get off of Gmail</u>, here's a beautiful, complete solution for your computer AND phone: <a href="https://lioncx.com/2019/07/26/gmail-alternative/"/>https://lioncx.com/2019/07/26/gmail-alternative/</a>

That being said, if you're sticking with Gmail and you decide to install the theme on this page, for personal privacy, I **strongly recommend** installing this style using the Stylus extension found here: <a href="https://lioncx.com/2018/10/21/gmail-dark-theme-2019/">Click here</a>

Works well with most Gmail themes! Try using with different Gmail backgrounds to find the look you like. Optional line for left menu to be grey instead of white.

I'm currently only maintaining this for desktop use.
