### Description
I really don't like reading black on white so I searched for a good style.
The one that I chose is style 2895 by user 2895.

I'm experiencing new color that strain less the eyes like light gray on dark gray. Links are green.
If you find other nice color couplings(in hexadecimal, please) write them in the reviews section below so everyone can try your choice, thanks.

There is also a little bit of Debian Gnu/Linux in about:blank :-)

If you want to contact me for any reason my email is marco1988@mail.com

As user 2895 recommend, use the firefox theme "N.A.S.A. night lanch" with this style which can be installed at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4908 .
