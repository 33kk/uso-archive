### Description
Like Twitter but hate its new rounded appearance? Well I've got the fix for you! 

Just a couple CSS tweaks for the UI's overall appearance. Softly rounded corners on avatars and buttons instead of full on circles as seen in the site's current iteration.

Tested and working on twitter.com and mobile.twitter.com
