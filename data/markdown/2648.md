### Description
Removes ads, links that just go to the page you are already on, a lot of images.

19 December 200 - Rewritten.  Removes underline from links except on hover.  Links to Politico.com are red (easily removed if you don't like it) to warn you that the page will load slowly.  New screenshots.

10 May 2012 - I have given up trying to get rid of the ads.  As soon as I filter one out another one shows up and my ad filters remove too many images.  Just use AdBlock.  I've left some of the ad blocking code - REMed out - if you want to experiment.

This style works well with style 39215
