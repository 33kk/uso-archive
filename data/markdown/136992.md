### Description
Focus!!! This style will remove most features from practice mode so you can make real progress.

- Removes progress bar (So you are not constantly looking at it, and becoming frustated when it goes back when you make a mistake)

- Removes the excercise title (It is pretty obvious what you have to do in each exercise once you have used Duolingo for a while)

- Removes the hints!!! (No more peeking into the hints, make real effort to complete the exercises and learn from your mistakes!!)

- Removes Skip and Check buttons (To Check just press Enter)

For the Ultimate Focus Experience I suggest you to use Full Screen on the browser (F11 on Chrome)
