### Description
For CSS users:
This style displays DIV elements and their class/id attributes, and hides other elements.

* * *

This is a little incomplete style :p
Some bugs have been found like following. 

- If DIVs have some class/id attributes, only the first class/id are rendered like "div.class" or "div#id", and others are rendered only their name.

If you know their solutions, or find another bug, please tell me.
