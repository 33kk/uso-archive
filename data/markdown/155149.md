### Description
For people like me, who plow through dozens of suggested videos on Youtube without realizing 4 hours have passed by, this simple style gets rid of the endless suggested videos on the sidebar and at the end of videos. Please send me feedback on your suggestions for styles that could make Youtube less addictive for all of us.
