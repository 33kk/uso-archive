### Description
The chrome version can be found here: style 33575

Update July 14, 2010: 
---------------------
More minor tweaks and the addition of Text Box Recolor

Someone on reddit requested I recolor the text entry boxes to fit with the theme. Here I have obliged with a small exception. Every text box has been recolored but the the text boxes in the comments area do not behave properly or at all like the rest of the text boxes on the site. The recolor for these text boxes is more of a hack than I'd like but it works well enough. You can check it out in the code if you want. The only thing I couldn't do for these text boxes was change their border color (the huge white border is unfortunate) and give them a :focus state where the background changes to a different color indicating that the text box is selected. Instead I have made it so that text inside of an unfocused text box fades and text in the focus text box appears as a bright white color. This achieves the same usability goal and feels like a decent enough work-around. The boxes in the messages/inbox section of reddit work in the same manner.

For all of the other text boxes, including the search box, selecting the text box will switch ts background to white, indicating focus, and turn the text to a dark charcoal color. You can see both of these effects in the new screenshots.

Update July 12, 2010: 
---------------------
Submit pages look much better and generally fit in with TDR theme.

Update July 7, 2010:
--------------------
Spoilers work properly now.


I liked style 19617 by user 1141 but there were a few things that I didn't like about it. I have tweaked almost every aspect of that theme and named my theme The Darker Reddit.

I also added options to highlight the submitter of a post and to visually separate the posts on the front page of reddit (or any subreddit for that matter. I've posted imgur links to a screenshot of each feature as well as the theme enabled on a page of comments (with Reddit Comment Boxes enabled).

Lastly, I fixed a couple places where the typical blue of reddit stuck around and threw off the dark nature of the theme. Deleted posts also showed up a bright contrasting grey that seemed out of place, they now show up with no background and a red version of [deleted].

Known Issues:
-------------
Unfortunately (for now), the buttons to expand text and video posts, as well as several other bright elements are actually images built into reddit and can be found here:

I'm working on a darker themed version but I have no specific date on when I'll have it implemented.
