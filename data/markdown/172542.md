### Description
A Hostwinds Dark Theme to help reduce eye strain. Currently only partial support. If you enjoy this theme please consider submitting a review with a green thumbs-up.

If you ever encounter problems give me a screenshot of the problem. Doing this will significantly aide me in solving your problems as soon as possible. If you are in a part of Hostwinds I have never seen before, I may ask that you supply steps to reproduce your current issue. Thank you.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The UserStyle forums are currently very broken. If you want to show me a screenshot of your problem please upload it to an external source like imgur then link it. Also if you get an error on attempting to submit a post, check before trying to submit again. Usually continuing to try and post your review only results in duplicate postings that require a mod to clear out.
