### Description
I love the functionality and portability of Google Calendar but I didn't like the interface, so I made this. 

Works nicely when you create a Chrome desktop link and tell it to treat it natively (launches Chrome with no tab or address bar, so it looks like a native calendar app). 

Keep in mind that this style removes most of Google Calendar other than the actual calendar, so if you want to do something like change which calendars appear or change a setting that is down in the menu, you'll need to disable the stylesheet temporarily. 

If you find any bugs or weird things please send me a message and I'll fix them. 

Hope you enjoy it.
