### Description
The Mailing List Archives for project mailing lists, that are offered by SF.Net, may be found by some users to suck to try to use. I find that this easyon-the-eyes (for me) dark theme helps. Top ads are removed. SourceForge.net does not *work well enough* for it to be required of us to have to suffer the stupid G*d-damn ads!

The update on Wed 05 Dec 2007 @ 13:14 UTC allowed for https: sf.net logged-in users to enjoy this style as well ;-/
