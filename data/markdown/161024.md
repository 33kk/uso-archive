### Description
This is re-imagination of CleanGoogle with more customization options and with new implementation of Google Material 2.
Google tends to test new feature really frequently and result of that the theme might not function well, please be pacient and wait for my fix.
I am will no longer support the theme with new updates, feel free to use it to expand the theme I started.
