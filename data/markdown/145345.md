### Description
Todist's color themes do nothing for the glaring bright of the main part of its interface. This theme adds subtle shading to temper the glare just a bit. This does not interfere with your todoist theme selection.

### Update notes
#2017-07-19
  Added change of font
  Tweak dividing line between left menu and main panel
