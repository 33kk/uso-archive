### Description
Just makes everything smaller, more compact, and get's rid of the searchbar, and with the addition of Monthis's <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/148849/collapsed-task-notes">Collapsed Task Notes</a> code, the description now is collapsed and can be seen when hovering over the task--this can now also be done with checklists.
<p>Here's an alternative for the <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/148850/shrink-your-habitica-tasks-font-and-buttons-edt">button and font size</a> by Mareinna.</p>
