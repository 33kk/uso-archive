### Description
<mark><b>Important: Click the "Show CSS Code" button first. The install button will work after that. I highly recommend this <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/">style</a> that makes the "Show CSS Code" button much easier to find.</b></mark> â€• This style will improve the new centered site that has been released by the developers, fixes most of the bugs to improve visual and your browsing experience and also bring back the old centered style. This will also remove and improve a few contents on the website. Please note that this is not yet compatible with the extension GaiaUpdates.

<b>Version:</b> 1.1.8 | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0dvpH9Kveq9ibpM_83bgI5e8-1izQgm60OD3lBkDDM/pub">View change logs</a> | <a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/">View website</a>
