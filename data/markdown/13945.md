### Description
Thank you to http://userstyles.org/styles/12303 by http://userstyles.org/users/8458 and http://userstyles.org/styles/4725 by http://userstyles.org/users/5576, which this style borrows from!

This is a style that adds custom colors to the rows in your gmail inbox as follows:
1. Rows with unread messages have a light blue color
2. Rows get a brighter blue highlight as you mouse-over them
3. Selected rows have a light green color

The color choices work better with the light-colored themes provided by new gmail (in "settings"), but you can change them to whatever you want.
