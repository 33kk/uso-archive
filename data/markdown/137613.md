### Description
Makes the content area of Wikia pages take up the full width. Removes the sidebar, since no room is left for it anyway. Does not otherwise remove ads or "navigation".

You may also wish to check out style 137612, style 137367, and style 162390, which I've tried to keep compatible. Combine them to make Wikia look how you want!
