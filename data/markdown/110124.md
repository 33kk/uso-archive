### Description
**ATTENTION** Please install Stylus due to Stylish plugin violating ToS by recording URLs you visit. This is basically the same code but with the mining code removed. URL - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne

NOTE: This is for the new site since the old MALgraph is shutting down. http://graph.anime.sc/
There are no other options for MAL themes, so, I made this one have options. Add your own background image and change the colors to your desire.

### Update notes
I know the graphs don't look the greatest, they are a pain.

Thanks to JeMhUnTeR for the background images.
