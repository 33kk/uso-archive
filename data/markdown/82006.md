### Description
Youtube for autists.

Forever WIP.

<b><u>Features:</u></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Responsive:</b> YouTube will now entirely adapt to the width of your browser window, allowing you more freedom in window configuration and screen sizes. This stylesheet should work on mobile, as well.
<li><b>Focus:</b> Header(Search, account) show up on hower, allowing the video player to be the absolute first thing on the page. This enables the user to "focus" on the video player simply by scrolling all the way up.
<li><b>Aspect Ratio:</b> The player will adapt to the aspect ratio of the video(Currently supported: 16:10, 16:9, 4:3, 5:4) and it will keep it under any circumstances.
<li><b>Autistic:</b> Features have been removed with no regards to other users than the author and his concepts of "minimalism".
</ul>

<b><u>"Thoroughly" Tested Pages:</u></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Watch</b>
<li><b>Search Results</b>
</ul>
