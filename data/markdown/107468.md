### Update notes
Fixed text issues with XenForo update
Added Minimal Style Forum Option
Took out the button to close the Onii-chan/Onee-chan box.
Added spoiler and tag width fix.
Fixed cover glitch.
Deleted these items, as they were implemented into the site already:
Fixes videos, so all of them are the same size.
