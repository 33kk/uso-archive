### Description
Since Facebook's sadism department has decided to flip our top navigation bar around and most people seem to hate it, I've tried my hand at flipping it back. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. The only thing missing is the little nublet (arrow) that would normally appear underneath the icons, since I couldn't get it to line up properly. I think that's something we can live without. This is only tested on Chrome.
