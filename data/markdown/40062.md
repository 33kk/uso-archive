### Description
For Firefox 4 or later

This converts the button from the Secure Login extension (aka Magic Wand https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4429/) into an indicator in the location bar.

It is designed to work well with style 38569.

To make it work you have to customize your toolbar as such :
Location Bar - Secure Login
or Location Bar - Feed - Secure Login
or Location Bar - Reload - Stop - Secure Login
or Location Bar - Reload - Stop - Feed - Secure Login

Known issues :
- This prevents from resizing the search bar. Workaround : remove the Feed and Secure Login buttons, resize the search bar, then put the buttons back.
- Does not work well with addons that modify the location bar.
