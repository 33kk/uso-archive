### Description
A darker theme for facebook messenger on web. Let relax your eyes when the sun went down and lights are turned off.

I used an encoded base64 image link for loading faster and being ineffected by internet. So if you want to reduce code lines, feel free to upload image to any host for your best experience. (Sorry for my bad English :D).
