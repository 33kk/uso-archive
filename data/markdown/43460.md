### Description
Andy Baio pointed out in a recent post that the red ("false") and green ("true") spheres on Snopes.com aren't very accessible (http://waxy.org/2011/01/colorblind_leading_the_blind/). Specifically, the shades of red and green that they chose are virtually indistinguishable for persons with red-green colorbliness (deuteranopia).

Andy created some modified versions of the red and green spheres that were easier to distinguish for persons with colorblindness, but the Snopes team was apparently uninterested in improving that area of their site.

This userstyle, with Andy's permission, swaps out Snopes' inaccessible color spheres and substitutes the more accessible variants that Andy created.
