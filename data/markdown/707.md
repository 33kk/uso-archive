### Description
This gets rid of all the annoying crap that is on your Myspace homepage. I'll admit, I can't figure out how to change the bulletin headings, so if you know how let us all know in a comment.

You can also apply this to your bulletin pages and mail pages! Just change the subdomain to "bulletin.myspace.com" and "mail.myspace.com".

You can thank me later.... Or now.

P.S. My ad doesn't show up thanks to AdBlocker (another Firefox Extension).
