### Description
This declutters the patreon pages (IMO) and uses CSS to remove the annoying "continue reading" feature. Will inevitably break non-creator pages, and some minor functions. But hey, if you're using the report button, you the snitch.

This will break at the slightest change to the site, but don't hold your breath for an update, this is just a drive-by.
