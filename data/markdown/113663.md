### Description
Makes DuckDuckGo.com look almost identical to Google, as far as it's possible. I noticed that I used Google.com over DuckDuckGo mainly because I was so accustomed to the way it looks, and trading my privacy for design and habit felt silly, so I thought I'd make the transition easy by making them look the same.
