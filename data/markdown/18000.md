### Description
Get feel of Safari 4 on Firefox; this style simulates the Star (Bookmark) button for Safari 4 which is integrated with Location (Address) bar.
style 19500 or style 17818
style 18681

REQUIRES:
1. userChromeJS extention @ http://userchromejs.mozdev.org/ + Sub-Script/XUL Loader (for easier script installation)
2. Star-Location-Safari4.uc.js script @ http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/428065/Star-Location-Safari4.uc.js

NOTE:
PUT "Space" left of location bar in toolbar customize menu.  (NO NEED for this now)

Works great with GrApple Crisp theme.  (Actually official release of Safari 4 drops the Tabs on Top so Yummy theme seems to be better.)

Checked ONLY with Firefox 3.1 or above (Firefox 3.5 is recommended) + GrApple themes: http://www.takebacktheweb.org/

Original userChromeJS script by user 875.
