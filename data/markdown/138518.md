### Description
The CSS of the video player used for videos on Pearson websites (eCollege, MathXL, MyMathLab, etc.) has a simple mistake in the CSS. 

If you've been trying to use captions, but they constantly hide behind the controls bar for a few seconds, then you know what I'm talking about.

This simple style simply fixes that annoying issue.
