### Description
This is a consolidated list of styles I got from reading a LifeHacker article (http://lifehacker.com/software/top/geek-to-live--consolidate-firefoxs-chrome-210542.php) and its comments on maximising the display area of Firefox.

Stuff that can be removed using customize toolbar are not included in the style.
Included are styles for:
- removing unwanted toplevel menus
  (edit and select which menus you want to hide)
- remove back and forward button markers/arrows
- remove disabled back, forward, stop buttons
- remove go button next to address bar
- remove go button (magnifying glass) next to search bar 
  (this style has been commented out, as I removed the search bar completely 
   and am using keywords for searching now).
