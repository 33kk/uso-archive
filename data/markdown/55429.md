### Description
This makes deviantART seem as if it is in fullscreen mode. It hides the bar at the top unless you hover over the top of the page with your cursor. It uses a CSS3 transition so use the latest versions of your browsers for it to work. Internet Explorer users before version 10 are out of luck. This took me a long time to do so a donation would be much appreciated!

I no longer use dA so I most likely won't notice any bugs with the latest version. The best way to tell me about bugs is to contact me on Weasyl. My username is Atraius. Sending me a note on dA would also work, but it might take be longer to notice it.
