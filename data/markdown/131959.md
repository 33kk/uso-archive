### Description
discord has a compact mode that's supposed to be analogous to IRC, but it doesn't really look like it at all. here's an attempt to fix that.

discord is a full on webapp (tm) so it's kinda hard to make sensible changes css-wise. that's why it's all weird. don't really worry too much about it.

### Update notes
i wouldn't enable the compact member list or the &lt;username&gt; format. i just added them because i found the ideas funny.
