### Description
This style is for Dynalist.io, and renders bullets as blue and centered rather than raised, links blue and with no underline; it widens the 'comfortable' list density to make it more comfortable; makes the title bold, increases the maximum size of inline image preview, and removes the vertical lines between nodes.
