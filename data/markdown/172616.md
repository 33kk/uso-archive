### Description
Makes the search results wider greenmangaming.com.

I got annoyed by how I couldn't see the whole title of the games listed. It gets cut short even though there's like 50% unused screen space that could easily fit the whole name.
So this fixes that.

Set a custom width for the search result container in the "Customize Settings" menu if you so wish.
The default is 75%. Use valid CSS values. (e.g. "1500px" or "90%" etc.)
No need to worry about setting it too large, max-width is set to 99%.
