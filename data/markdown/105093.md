### Description
This style expands the content width to 100%, rather than default 900px. By setting the width to a percentage, you should be able to fully view a page of your Tomato settings on wider or thinner sized browser windows. On wide browser windows, in some pages (such as "Device List") you're able to see a full line without line-wrapping.
