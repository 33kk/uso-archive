### Description
Like the name says, it cleans up the new home screen. It annoyed me from the second it existed and all the mods I could find did remove the content of the boxes, but not their labels, leaving an unfinished look. I removed all the labels in the right sidebar, except 'Requests', which is actually useful and 'Highlights' which I couldn't remove, at least not the label (if anyone does, let me know). Then I moved the feed selector from the left to the right underneath the sidebar, shrinked it down to 200px and adjusted the width of the news feed to fill in the newly created space.
