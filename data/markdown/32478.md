### Description
I tweaked style 21532 by user 29240, as FastEddie (TV Tropes Admin) has changed the button layout, messing up the userstyle. Rather than wait on user 29240 to change it (since he said he won't be updating for a while), I figured I'd just fix it myself. If/When he updates, I'll remove this if he asks.

The old one put the log on every button, and flung the button borders everywhere. I'd show you a pic, but putting 2 images makes them both too small.
