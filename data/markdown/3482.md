### Description
Following a change to the World of War WoW forums, a number of people were missing the light background dark text of the old forum design. For all those work browsers (including myself) I've edited style 1910 by user 2018 to apply only to incgamers.com.

I'm sure someone can edit this style to give the site some nicer graphics, but I'm not the most technical of people - it took ages just to figure out how to get it to only apply to one site!
