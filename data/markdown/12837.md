### Description
An Edit of  Dark Carbon Theme for Youtube.com by storm119

Credits to Valacar for his  codes and efforts on his YouTube.com - dark gray redesign (vC)  which the original is based

I have edited the colours and made it more plain 

also the video is resized in wide-screen as with the changes to youtube.com made in DEC 08

for this to work properly you need to add this filter to adblock plus 
If you right click on the right hand side of search before upload and adblok that part of the page the style works perfectly

but if some one can figure out how to hide these in the style it would be a great help thx

Also it auto more info's and creates a scrool box for long messages 

  

if you do not want the menu bar replace the line below  

#masthead .bar {background-color:#3a3939 !important;}
with
#masthead .bar {display: none !important;}



Enjoy
