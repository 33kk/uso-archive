### Description
While the democratically elected Saviour of Highsec represents perfection in his quest to purge highsec of bot aspirants and maintain EVE's true spirit, those of us who read his website may -- alas! -- be less perfect, and so find that his unquestionably flawless choice of black text on a white background induces eyestrain. Such a shame that anything could interfere with our daily reading of the Code! For the benefit of those like me, therefore, I humbly present this style.
