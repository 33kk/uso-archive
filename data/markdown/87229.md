### Description
While moving to R2 forums, the <a href="http://forum.r2games.com/forumdisplay.php?356-City-of-Steam">City Of Steam forums</a> kept their nice looking theme and all, but there has been a little problem. Probably every single person who browsed there has seen how quotes and post fields are completely different colors from the rest. And it's a huge difference.

It even hurts your eyes, right?
Here I come, with this userstyle simple enough (actually not that simple :P), just changing these colors to something better fitting.
I hope you enjoy it and don't hesitate to give me any feedback (you can send me a PM on the forums <a href="http://forum.r2games.com/private.php?do=newpm&u=1188771">here</a>). ^^

<strong>WARNING: As there is no way to differentiate CoS forums from the rest of the R2 forums, it will still be activated on these. You may want to disable it if you are going on other R2 games forums.</strong>
