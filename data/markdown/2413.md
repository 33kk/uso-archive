### Description
Don't you hate it that the Digg comment box is at the end of the story? Whenever you want to add a comment, you have to scroll down to the end, thus ruining your context. I found myself going back and forth so often that i created this style to bring the box up to me.  

This style does the following:

1 ) Fixes the position of the comment box to stick on the lower right corner of the screen

2 ) Adjusts the spacing of to center the content columns.

3) Removes the "check spelling" button. Why is that even necessary? Firefox already has a spell checker that's better than the pop-up box Digg offers.
