### Description
FEATURES:
<ul>
<li>Hides all workouts, comments, and other posts</li>
<li>"Give Props" button is massive and turns purple on hover</li>
</ul>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>
Prop Bomber's Toolbox is a weapon of mass motivation, used purely for prop bombing, as it removes all social features. When you hit the end of the profile, deactivate PBT and use CTRL+F to find and read any possibly interesting posts on the victim's profile you noted on the way down.

Use this tool wisely.
