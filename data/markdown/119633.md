### Description
<b>YOU NEED TO USE 'Advanced Style Settings' BUTTON DUE TO NEW SITE DESIGN CHANGES !!!</b><br><br>Reduces height of popup menus, popup panel menus, dropdown menus, tree listings, Bookmarks/History sidebars menus and elements in preferences windows, for Firefox and Firefox addons windows.

### Update notes
As it allows fitting more items on screen, it's specially useful for large toolbar buttons menus of some addons like e.g. NoScript on sites with many scripts sources, also for large history/bookmarks listings on menus, or default sidebars, or for other tree listings like DOM Inspector ones, or for old style search box menu list (for FF29 or higher, at least through Classic Theme Restorer option). See screenshots for all this. The longest the menus and the more limited the vertical space, the more useful this style becomes, possibly allowing to avoid overflow on various menus.

This style is not compacting all Firefox interface, to fit my needs I also use Classic Theme Restorer and Hide Caption Titlebar Plus.
