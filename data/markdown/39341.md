### Description
Restores the Newsfeed to its original 13px font size so you don't have to feel like you're going blind, removes the line break after names in status updates, and removes right side "Ticker", "People to Subscribe To" and "Sponsored" sections so it's not such a seizure-inducing clusterf*ck. Take that Zuckerberg.
