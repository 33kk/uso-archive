### Description
This is a trimmed down style for the base64 decoder and encoder over at motobit.com.

I'm sure many stylish designers will find this handy if these use that particular site for decoding and encoding images for their styles.

This is a single page prefix only, i didn't see any point styling the whole site when i only use a single page, used url-prefix as the url can change when using certain areas of the tool.

It's a dark look (i design later at night and prefer dark pages, less eye pain) but can be changed on the BODY line, simply adjust BACKGROUND and COLOR #HEX to your preference. I have assigned 1 font for the page also, as you can see in the same line, adjust this as you choose, along with line-height.

Also removes some links, iframe, ads etc.... not fully tested as adblock plus is already doing half my blocking for me.... Does not affect the tool functionality whatsoever!...
