### Description
Makes YouTube look like it did in late-2012

### Update notes
WARNING: This, along with the Early-2014, and incomplete 2011 theme, will cease to function, as Google will get rid of the classic layout (Which these 3 themes are built on top of). If you're interested in either of these themes, I suggest that you try them ASAP.


Disclaimer: this was made in a 1920x1080 display and as such, some things may look off on a smaller resolution, you can remedy this by zooming out, but remember, "Your Mileage May Vary"

I recommend the Disable SPF YouTube user-script, as the theme tends to glitch out

Also, you need to be on the Pre-2017 YouTube design for it to work properly
