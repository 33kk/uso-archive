### Description
For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This style sets Focused Tabs and Hovered Tabs to a Min-Width(Adjust to your own preference) for quick "Tab-Title" readability. Works great for those who browse the web with many tabs visible in the tab bar especially when in "Tab Overflow Mode".

Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.
