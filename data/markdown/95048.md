### Description
This compacts Proboards' styling on the Gunnerkrigg Court forums, which if you ask me is full of unnecessary padding and just bloat in general.
Also adds some minor aesthetic changes, like alternating post colors and filled-background quotes.

More screenshots, with descriptions, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/NfTup">here</a>.

If you happen to have certain fonts from the webcomic installed (Ale and Wenches BB, Spirit Medium) the theme will use one of them for the banner text.

Feel free to adapt for other forums.
