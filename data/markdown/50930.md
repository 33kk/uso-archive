### Description
[Updated 8/5/11]
Facebook made some changes, I've updated the style sheet to match this. The biggest change is Facebook has it's own scroll bar now.

[Updated 7/25/11]
Chrome had a silly little problem I missed with the options gear thingy hiding itself, it has been fixed.

[Updated 7/20/11]
Hey, so it ends up facebook uses this fancy javascript thingymabobber to calculate how many users it should show to you. To combat this, I made some changes. On top of that, I added the ability for you to choose if you want to show offline friends or not. Let me know how it goes. Please note that if you turn off offline friends, it also turns off idle friends.

This is a simple style that makes the FB chat similar to it's older appearance. If you guys want it to be even more like it or notice any places where there could be improvements/needs to be fixed let me know.
