### Description
Tumblr dashboard theme with custom 'new post' icons.

"<i>At Dynevor there ought to be none of the modern parvenu flowers, such as dahlias, cactusses, chrysanthemums, and calceolarias, all distinguished foreigners, newly imported, and generally received with ecstasies of admiration; but in an old Welsh scene, we expect to find only the native families of lilies and ham-hocks.</i>" <sup><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2wsHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA257&lpg=PA257&dq=cactusses">*</a></sup>
