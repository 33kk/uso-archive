### Description
This only affects the logged in portion of Phoenix.edu. I created this style because the message board system is incredibly difficult to use on wide-screen displays with less than 1080 vertical resolution. You end up constantly scrolling up and down as you navigate and view posts. Sometimes, you will get double scroll bars due to the nested iframe. This style removes all of the wasted vertical space and compacts the vertical space to greatly enhance the user experience (though it doesn't remove vertical scrolling completely).
