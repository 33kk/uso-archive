### Description
17/5/2009 - Fixed some stuff.Also waiting for the sniper update (and spy too!)

21/1/2009 - Modified a bit at the "/* hides ads */" section so that the ads will be completely blocked.Also I just brought the game =)

26/9/2008 - I'm done updating the front page for 4chan.They look horrible when I see the page for the first time in few months.And also I'm done on adding another classes on the background picture.To change you just need to find this section of the CSS code here :_

html,body {
font-size:20px !important;
background-color:#e9b786 !important;
background-image:url('http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/3753/pyrobp4.png') !important;
background-position: right bottom !important;
background-repeat:no-repeat !important;
background-attachment:fixed !important;
color:#FFFFFF !important;
}

As you can see you need to change the url for the background image there.Here's the background image url for each classes

the rest I'll do it later since meh final exam is just around the corner.

Thanks to the game itself I already addicted to that damn game (and the game is not mine either! A very big thanks to my fren who always letting me playing the game on his pc lol).I'll try to make another background pic for other classes as well later on....

Cheers mate!~
