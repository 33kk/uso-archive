### Description
Supplement style to style 1123 or style 1484 that completely replaces the menubar text with icons. Apply it along with either one of those styles (not both) and it will switch it to Icons Only.
This will do absolutely nothing without either of those styles applied as well.

The Before screenshot is of style 1123 with Icons Only.
The After screenshot is of style 1484 with Icons Only.
