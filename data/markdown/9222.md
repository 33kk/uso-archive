### Description
This style shrinks the heights of multi-line tabs (which you can have with TabMixPlus), also using smaller fonts and, last but not least, fixing the tab bar height with multi-row tabs in Firefox 3 on KDE 3. Code is partly borrowed from some other styles (unfortunately I forgot to remember where I took it from) and adjusted to do its job.

Recommendation: Additionally install style 8624 by user 7858

Changes:

1.0.0.8: Fixed the close button (x) position
1.0.0.7: fixed height for single-row tab
1.0.0.6: Some cleanup and reorganization - adjustments from 1.0.0.5 should now work in most addons options dialogs
1.0.0.5: Some adjustments for tabs in options dialogs of NoScript, TMP, ImageZoom and LocalInstall
1.0.0.4: Better adjustment of close button on tabs; fixing bottom of last tab row with TMP
1.0.0.3: A little cleanup - and making the selected tab a little better distinguishable
1.0.0.2: Removing dotted border around text on selected tab (code taken from style 6295)
