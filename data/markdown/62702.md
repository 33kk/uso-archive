### Description
Sick of Arial and Verdana?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sans">Open Sans</a> is one of the most beautiful, readable sans-serif typefaces available.

This stylesheet makes Open Sans the overriding font for Google Search, Google News, Gmail, Facebook, and Reddit.

Add more sites to the list, bearing in mind that all fonts get changed, so if monospacing is often required for content to display properly, skip it.

If you set your browser's default font to Open Sans, it will display on sites that only use the generic "sans-serif" declaration (e.g. Wikipedia, Craigslist, Feedly).

If you use a regional variant of Google (.ca, .co.uk, etc.), edit the URLs accordingly.

This stylesheet requires that Open Sans be installed on your system. Download it here: <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans">fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans</a>
