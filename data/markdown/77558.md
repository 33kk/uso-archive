### Description
Save your eyesight with this ultra-dark style that removes much of the glaring bright white background on Bloomberg's Businessweek.com. I am igor at http://techlorebyigor.blogspot.com and I code dark styles for several web sites. Wherever there is white, let us replace that with black. Note: I do not interfere with advertising. My focus here is on adjusting the brightness, nothing else.
