### Description
Makes About:Blank display an image of your choice. Excellent way to implement a new UI feature for your favorite web browser.

* Thanks to user 1744's style 1761, upon which this style is loosely based

Integrates with Style 6488 and if both styles are installed, you can customize both the about:blank look AND the new-tab's background image as well.

Features:
- Appears when opening Firefox
- Appears when downloading files
- Appears when a blank tab is opened
- Appears when a closed tab is re-opened or restored
- Appears when a page transitions within same domain
- Appears when loading certain Addons that use a tab to display contents (such as Brief RSS Reader, and Regular Expression Tester)
- Appears as background of Mr Tech's Local Install - My Config
- Appears as background of an opened "Scanned Page" from the Update Notifier extension
- Appears while loading a page's source code
- Appears when loading your bookmarks sidebar
- (NEW) Will NOT appear as the background image when composing or replying to an email in Google's Gmail [FIX]
- Clean and very appropriate default image, included with style (Firefox logo - shadowed)

Additional Information:
This Style has been tested on multiple Firefox Themes, and has worked perfectly on each.
Locate the About-Blank page by typing about:blank in your locationbar or the Firefox 3 Awesome Bar (AwesomeBar)
*NOTE: Please Clear your Cache and Restart your browser after installing or changing this style, your custom image will need to be cached in order for it to be displayed.

Instructions:

Fully customizable style

Changelog:

+ New Code Cleanup added as well
* Please Remember to BACK UP your custom code before updating

1.0.0.1:
 + Fixed Issues with Gmail Reply, Conversations and Forwards.  Now Gmail window areas will not show the background, and you can now email and chat without any nuisances.  This was requested by a user.... Thanks for your input!
