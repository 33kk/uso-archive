### Description
This theme is based on the Metro - Firefox Theme from BoneyardBrew. I was downloading the dEEP 7 3.0 for Firefox: http://userstyles.org/styles/33305?r=1282042577 and I was enthused but I wanted to change this theme and make it smaller. 
Now it's a own theme and the code from seahorsepip was only a help - but a very good one ;)

Greets zu BoneyardBrew and seahorsepip for their themes. Without them, my own theme weren't created!
