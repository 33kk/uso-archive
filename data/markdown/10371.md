### Description
Mirai Nikki style made for 4chan.

A Yuno stylesheet I made originally for personal use, but due to the amount of people asking to use it I decided to release it.

I'll probably be updating this later on to add more things, I'm still playing around with this style.

Update; Changed highlighted post so the name of the posted doesn't get suffocated by the same color.

Update2; Fixed a minor change from the last update, I accidentally changed the date and filename for OP's post into black, it's fixed now.
