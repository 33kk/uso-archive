### Description
This will increase the font size from 70% to 1em, which is the default font size YOU set in your Tools (Tools -> Options -> Content Tab).  

I've also added a line to emphasize which discussions are unread by changing the link color to dark red on a light gray bar.  Sometimes, discussions with short titles don't always stand out as unread messages.
