### Description
This is used with DEFAULT theme on dynalist so you can specifically target some documents to have a DARK theme.

I keep my theme on DEFAULT, and then apply this theme with specific dynalist URL on documents with lots of code in it. Used if you do lots of coding and need a snippet manager
