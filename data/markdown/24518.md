### Description
Not much to say about this other than
a) This is for the Mozillaca.com community microblogging site.
b) It won't work on anything but a VERY recent Firefox version. I've only ever tried it on current nightly builds, so even 3.6 might be too old. Or not. You tell me.

This basically applies gradients and shadows to everything that isn't nailed down. Look at the screenshots and decide for yourself. Any comments are appreciated.
