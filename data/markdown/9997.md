### Description
In an effort to take Khoi's post a bit further: http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2008/0617_spacing_is_e.php

I didn't remove the ads, because they don't bother me. And honestly, I find it amusing to see what kinds of ads they serve me based on the conversations I have. I'm easily pleased, what can I say?
