### Description
<i>Elegant</i> is one of CodeMirror's stock style sheets, adapted to Firefox's implementation. Firefox 27+ only.

This version appears as its author intended, but it's different enough from my <a href="/styles/98630">first version</a> that I decided to post it as a new style instead of repairing the other one.
