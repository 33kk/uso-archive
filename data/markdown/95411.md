### Description
<b><a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/140067/dark-pandora-new-site-support-wip">Out of date! Please install my new Pandora style for the new site!</a></b>

Designed for Firefox and Chrome, this is a re-hash of my Pandora8 theme that takes Pandora and removes color, replacing it with all forms of gray. It also enables you to pick how much screen space Pandora should take up, allowing you to view more album art and artist information with less scrolling. Formerly called "Pandora8."

### Update notes
Update 11/13/16: I disabled my adblocker for pandora.com and noticed some ads were taking up lots of vertical space with wide layouts. These have been hidden.

Update 8/31/16: I noticed I forgot to add support for connecting to Pandora via HTTPS. This has been fixed.

<b>Update 10/31/14: I've unhidden the account menu;</b> you should now be able to access your <b>account settings, log out, and log in without requiring the theme to be disabled</b>. I've also styled the account settings page and login page so those should be much more friendly with this style.

Note: this theme *should* cover every page you will ever use on Pandora. It is my goal with this theme to provide 100% support, so if you would like to see a particular feature or page supported, email me or provide me feedback on this style.

This theme was written entirely by me; that is, I did not borrow anything used in this style from others. All custom graphics were made by me using Paint.NET.
