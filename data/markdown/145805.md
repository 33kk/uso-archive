### Description
Remove whitespace from the site, and optionally hide the sidebar with a style setting.   Uses the whole window and makes more posts visible on screen at once.

### Update notes
If the optional sidebar setting is not supported with your style tool, you can replace /*[[SIDEBAR]]*/ with <i>display: none;</i> 

For my screen it drops the site from about 3 posts visible to about 5 posts visible.  I'm looking at increasing that even more by reducing the user info blocks on every post.
