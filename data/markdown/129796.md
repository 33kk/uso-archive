### Description
This is just a colour coating for the default theme (Made by Nikkbu (http://nikkbu.info/)) and it does not include the forums section and the login section when logging onto the site however, some colours from torrent section of the site might carry over to the forum section(shown in 5th screenshot).
I also have no clue why the forums side is sticking to the left, if i find the problem i will try and fix it.

I have 0 coding experience and all I did was change colour values of the existing theme, Also If you find any weird coloured parts please send me a PM through the forums so i can look into it.

Upload torrents section is looking weird, i know. So expect an update soon.

There are parts i could not find but please don't see this as a permanent solution and see it as a temporary solution until admins make changable themes.

This was tested on waterfox. It should work with firefox.
