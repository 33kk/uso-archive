### Description
Changes Tumblr's homepage header bar in the style of Undertale. It also changes the cursor into the soul heart when it hovers over the header, but not through the rest of the page. The buttons change color like in the game as well.

Button explanations:
HOME - Dasboard
MAP - Explore
MAIL - Inbox
CELL - Messaging
ACT - Activity
XKIT - XKit (if you have New XKit installed)
ITEM - Account

Want just the cursor? (or make the cursor work on the whole page) head over to my <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/120897/soul-heart-cursors-for-tumblr" >SoulHeart Cursors for Tumblr</a> style!

User <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/303180" >Pretzel</a> has made <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/121174/tumblr-undertale-dashboard-theme" >an Undertale Tumblr dashboard theme</a> which looks absolutely fantastic with Tumblrtale!

### Update notes
If something breaks contact me at thesilverinfinity.tumblr.com and I'll see if I can fix it. I'm still testing it out myself so there could very well be a few pesky bugs
