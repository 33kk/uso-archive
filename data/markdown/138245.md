### Description
THIS STYLE IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED ON THIS SITE.  TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UPDATES, PLEASE INSTALL THE STYLE FROM THE <a href="https://github.com/Devo7v/UserCSS">GITHUB REPO</a>.

IMPORTANT: If you would like the Google Bar at the top themed on Google Calendar and many other Google sites, please install my <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/120351/google-bar-dark-style">Google Bar - Dark Style</a>.

This style was developed to match the Dark theme for Gmail.  It also goes nicely with <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/102256/google-calendar-dark-style">Google Calendar - Dark Style</a> and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/62121/google-voice-dark-style">Google Voice - Dark Style</a>.  Nearly everything has been themed and every item in the CSS has descriptions so you can edit it as you see fit.
