### Description
Want to check on facebook events without getting distracted by notifications and chat? Now you can! Just install this and then all events pages will be made distraction-free!

It might make sense, if you use StayFocusd, to make this page allowed while the rest of facebook is limited to 20 minutes per day or whatever.
