### Description
Marks "undesirables" in reddit. In short, everyone with a red tag is automatically branded with a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Kennzeichen_f%C3%BCr_Schutzh%C3%A4ftlinge_in_den_Konzentrationslagern.jpg">red triangle.</a> This saves clutter. Filtering out people with different opinions has never been easier!

You can still click on their triangle to find out what their thought crime was, no worries. Can't have people with different opinions, can we?
