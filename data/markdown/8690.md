### Description
Allows you to Customize the text and background image of Password Prompt Popups.


Features:
+ Background image will be a faded Firefox logo with shadowing
+ Supports a huge list of Fonts (discussed below)
+ Image supplied in default code is hard-coded - allowing you to view the background, even when offline!
+ Background image is static and is centered on the window.
= Optional - Text size of the popup will be larger (must uncomment)
= Optional - Bold text for easier readability (must un-comment)

Fonts Supplied (Supported):
- Currently, I supplied the following Fonts in the Code:
1. Segoe UI (User Interface of Vista)
2. Calibri (Text of Vista)
3. Verdana (XP Font)
4. Helvetica (XP)
5. Tahoma (XP User Interface Default Font)
6. Arial Global Font

Applies to:
+ Login Popups
+ Logon Windows
+ Password Prompts / Alerts
+ Site Security Entries

Browser Versions:
- Works on Firefox 3 (ALL Themes - Full support!)
- Works on Firefox 2

Additional Information:
+ Feel free to edit the CSS.  You can customize the fonts, enable bolding, and change the background image, even change the font size!  No Re-posts without asking though!


Integrates with the following Styles:
+ Style 8516

Future Releases:
+ I am currently working on the bug that may cause the custom background to show on popups other than just password prompts.  It also affects Firefox 2.


Changelog:
