### Description
The CSS file I use for Massively. There are more CSS extensions than I can shake a stick at, but the one I use is called Stylebot. Sadly, whoever designed Massively's website used div tags for items that seemingly have no relationship towards each other, so there is only so much one can do to altar the look of the site without running into issues of changing one aspect inadvertently changing multiple aspects. I've tried to make concessions in those cases, so it would be parts of the site you'll hardly ever look at that suffer (ie: the footer).
