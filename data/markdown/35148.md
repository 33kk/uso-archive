### Description
This removes almost everything on the browsing page except for the articles, while keeping the original colors and theme intact. You have the option to remove the navigation bars up top if you do not use them. 

The only issue I have found with this bit of coding is when you just happen to come across a posting picture with a width of 300px or height of 90px, because I used that reference to remove parts of the page. In the months I have used it, I have only come across one posting like that though, so not an issue imo.
