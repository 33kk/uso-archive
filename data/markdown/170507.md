### Description
This theme is fork of <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/131249/dev-s-dark-stackoverflow">Dev's Dark StackOverflow theme by Alex Saratow</a>. He is an author of almost everything here and he is an original creator of a theme.

But... as it was updated last time on 14th February 2017, I decided to fix most important things and - following the rights of the licence - publish it here, to make it easier to install, without having to make corrections on your own.

Additionally, I followed <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/511159">Rafael Gawenda's</a> tip to change every .so-header to .top-bar. Thank you!
