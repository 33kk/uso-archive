### Description
Hunts/Possible Hunts - Fer an anon on Tumblr.
Pending - Requested by one-a-n-d-lonely on Tumblr.

### Update notes
Update 1 (April 9th): Fixed... kinda.

With the way that Tumblr's new update werks, there is no long a specific div fer 'Queue'; it's a list. So it goes in order like 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

*If yer using this and don't have a queue set up, it'll drop down to 'Edit Appearance'.
*If yer using this and are on a side blog where it says 'Members', it shoves them down an extra number, turning 'Drafts' into the spot where 'Queue' normally is. So on side blogs 'Drafts' is 'Research'.

It's very frustrating and I haven't figured out how to fix it just yet, or if it's even fixable at all.
