### Description
ZB's Bookmark Zoomer enlarges bookmark bar items when hovered over.
By default they are scaled by a factor of 1.5, but you can easily change the value.

*Firefox 3.5 Required*

This is really just the tip of the iceberg for the newly introduced CSS transform functions.
Other effects include rotate, skew, and matrix.  Firefox 3.5 FTW!

Please let me know if you find any other creative ways to utilize this new functionality.

More info on the new -moz-transform property can be found here:

***Note: If clipping occurs, please uncomment the optional code.
