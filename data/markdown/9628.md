### Description
ｷﾀ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!

NOT CLEAN ANYMORE, Kotaku changed their code already

v1.0

It's like I'm really on Dark Diamond!

Dark Diamond is an up-and-coming blog bringing you video game, anime, and general otaku news at http://darkdiamond.net/. This Kotaku skin and cleaner shows off our mascot and makes use of our distinctive purple and black color scheme.

This is pretty much a joke style, but it does clean up Kotaku massively and leaves very little left but the stories, the pictures, and DDN-Tan. Even some navigation is missing. The simple style is suited to those who frequently read the site via RSS rather than comment. Features:

(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞

-Dark Diamond color scheme
-DDN-Tan cheerfully staying by your side through every news story
-Links are yellow on mouseover
-No sidebar
-No logos
-No ads
-No author information
-No "more" or "back" navigation
-No comments
-No post separators
-Final Destination

-IMPORTANT: host the background picture somewhere else! So go to this url: http://i34.tinypic.com/2l9iayq.png, save it, and replace it in this line of text:
>background-image:url('http://i34.tinypic.com/2l9iayq.png')

( ゜▽゜)=◯)`ν゜)

Issues:
-Couldn't get rid of italics in article titles
-Couldn't get rid of border colors for images
-Extremely limited navigation
-I probably won't fix this much, but if you like it maybe I will

Please provide feedback, lemme know what you think.

About me and my styles, and how to get me to make more of them:

I update my styles a lot because I often make stupid little mistakes AND I like to tweak stuff to death, so make sure you always have the most current versions of the styles. I will note a few important changes in the description. 

Thanks for the big number of installs on the Konata skin! I am truly flattered. Because of this response, trust me, I will continue to make more skins in the future. In fact, if you drop me a line I will even take commissions. At this point, my proposed prices are 10 bux for a 4chan skin and 20 bux for other websites. This is because I have more knowledge of the 4chan CSS and am not yet a full-fledged CSS wizard, so each new site will have a bit of a learning curve for me. Also in general there are still several things I don't know how to do, but I could easily make some skins even more involved than my current ones with a little bit of research. 

COMMISSIONS IN SUMMARY:

-$10 for 4chan skins and $20 for other sites. If the skin is pitifully simple I'll drop it to $5
-Talk to me at kifte_arcane@hotmail.com or quiche on Rizon
-Tell me what you want and I will try my best to deliver
-I will work closely with you and you'll see beta screens
-Skins could take up to a week to complete
-If I fail at making the skin for some reason, you don't pay
-Payment is expected once I tell you a skin has been completed and show final screens

Also, random acts of donation are highly appreciated. WHY DON'T YOU PAY ME A LOT, FOREVER?
