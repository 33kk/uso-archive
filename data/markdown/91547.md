### Description
Cuts the crap. Darkens the screen, everything except the navigation and the content is gone.

### Update notes
Completely compatible with style 22251, the two can be active at the same time.

Added your-choice-of-colored backgrounds. Warning: Picking something other than the default will cause interesting effects with style 22251

NOTE: If you activate style 22251, and THEN activate this one (just clicking it from the Stylish menu) then there are no side effects.
