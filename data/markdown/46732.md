A userstyles.org recolor with some font, border, background, etc changes. It also removes a few things for a cleaner interface.

Recommended font is Ubuntu, with other options.

-Light version here: style 49569

### Update notes
*** Important Stuff ***
-Tested on Windows 7/Vista and Linux with Firefox 4.0+
-As of 2.0.0, a couple of small things will not work with Chrome/Safari/Opera (mainly code to edit the size of some page headers), but I hope to fix this in a coming update.
-To use the Ubuntu font you need to download the font from http://font.ubuntu.com/
-To use Terminus as the font, you need to download it from http://fractal.csie.org/~eric/wiki/Terminus_font
-The code for the pop-up code box is edited code from style 47641 by user 14255. All credit goes to him for originally making it.
