### Description
Hi everyone, here's my first attempt using stylish.
I felt that this excellent site could use the following improvements on the home page :
- use "boxes" only where necessary
- reduce visual impact of tags
- bring the question asked to prominence by shifting the stats to the right
- distinguish between answered, answer accepted, unanswered questions
- remove "highlight" effect of the welcome box
- try to stay within the same palette

Please excuse any lazy code .. Enjoy !
