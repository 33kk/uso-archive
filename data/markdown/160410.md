### Description
Unethical Raffle Helper 2 (URH) is a user style for Scrap.TF that gives the raffle list more contrast and reveals hidden links in raffle messages.

### Update notes
This userstyle has been tested with bright and dark themes. This style has not been tested in conjunction with any other style, besides the official ones on the page.

Update 2018-07-13: URH should now work with the new site CSS. If it still doesn't work for you, try removing the "@-moz-document" line and the last brace.
Update 2018-07-15: Fixed a bug where the variables wouldn't always get set.
Update 2019-02-04: Today marks the release of URH 2! The entire style was rewritten and comes with new features.
