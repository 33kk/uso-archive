### Description
I love Urban Dictionary but those ADs along with the definitions (like buy this definition on a tshirt, or on a mug, etc) are quite annoying. And I think these ADs with big tit girls are quite distracting too :-) so I kind of cleaned everything and made the page wider (100%) and increased the font size by 10%.

Update 28/Nov/2010: Removed the floating footer advertising they decided to insert recently

Update 21/Jun/2013: Removed the 'advertise here' link and hidden right table column.
