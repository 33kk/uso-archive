### Description
/*Crunch the view on Free Deliveries index page - http://www.iconbuffet.com/freedelivery/packages
See if you're in line to get the next new delivery fresh because your previous fresh deliveries should line up in one column (disrupted by sets sent according to other criteria e.g. AHS sent to VIPs; irrelevant for sets released on old system i.e. pre-March 2007)*/
