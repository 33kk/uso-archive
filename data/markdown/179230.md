### Description
This userstyle modifies the new google search results layout (with the favicon line).
It:
 - swaps the 2 lines: the "favicon" line and the "title" line.
 - hides the favicon (as of v1.0.9, the icon doesn't seem to appear anymore)
 - reduces the font size of the result blocks to 90%, which is closer to the old size (before 2019).

The screenshot above is from the userstyle version. In that version the modifications can be toggled, the zoom value is selectable. It has options to reduce whitespace by altering the line's height and the margin, which isn't included in this simple userstyle.
The fully configurable version is available on <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/395346-google-search-old-style" target="_blank">greasyfork</a>. See also the screenshots at the bottom of that page.
