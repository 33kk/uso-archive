Removes the upgrade features banners and "You might also like" on the right sidebar. On the left sidebar, removes 'Integrations', 'Share collections' and 'Support' buttons, Upgrade button at the bottom, and the 'Plus Add' button and space between between 'More' and your feeds so more of them can fit on the screen at once.
