### Description
This prevents the WordPress reader from having specific banner alterations by the provider that you may not want to view.

For example, this will prevent the display of the eyestrain-causing Rainbow banner that they are forcing on people as part of their efforts to stray from being a speech platform and enter the field of being a propaganda platform.
