### Description
** Facebook add new adverts all the time. I recommend using this theme in conjunction with an adblocker. ** <br>
Beautiful, simplified design. No adverts, and wider viewing of your posts. Also, a pretty login design, with your choice of login background! <br>
Please give contructive critism on how to improve this design (ie bugs)! Thanks! <br><br>

### Update notes
<strong> Version 2.1.0 </strong> <br>
Twitter emojis and some material design icon replacements! More coming soon (hopefully this week). Search bar needs to be fixed in Eng US version.

<strong> Version 2.0.6 </strong> <br>
Completely rewritten. I've noticed some bugs however those should be patched soon. Please give feedback <3

<strong> Version 1.2 </strong> <br>
I've finally got around to adding multiple choices for the login background. They're really pretty UNSPLASH photos. I've also fixed a bug where some textboxes' values (like search) were not visible.  Alongside this, I've increased the width, and I've also fixed some other small things. Enjoy and if you like it, <em>rate or donate!</em>
