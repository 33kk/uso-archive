### Description
A quick sunday-afternoon attempt at making the Twist (by todoist) website dark.

I put this together over a period of about 2 hours. It's neither perfect, refactored nor refined. I just wanted a dark theme for Twist.

Note: In the screenshot I've zoomed out to roughly 80%. With default 100% zoom the site's "center column" actually fills the window completely.
