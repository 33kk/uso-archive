### Description
Improves Rockpapershotgun's new theme. Hides ads (without blocking, use in conjunction with an adblocker if you want), removes several areas of whitespace and unnecessary text. Reduces screen real estate taken up by the header and featured articles. Hides the "tips" etc. article suggestions. Adds backgrounds to RPS team member comments, so we can easily make them out again. Fixes a bug with RPS comment button styling. 
<b>Makes RPS read like the old, in a new theme.</b>

<b>Customisable options:</b>
Minimal site header
Minimal spotlight 'featured articles'
<b>Dark mode</b>!
Darken images (default no) - slightly darkens pictures so as to not blind those of us on the dark theme when an exceptionally bright image is embedded. Image will show normally on mouse over. 
Logo choices!
Centered comments
Line height (spacing)
Justified hyphenation
Show/hide ads


TO DO: add higher density content options

Removed new Newsletter sub button from minimal header - on the basis that anybody that uses my theme will be a regular user of RPS and has at least seen it on the initial few visits.
Added option to darken images. 

Update v0.8.5:
Added comment styling for RPS 'contributors' - i.e. article authors who are not part of core RPS team, to aid in picking them out in conversations.

Update v0.8.1:

Added @media queries for the header
Added @media queries for the spotlight area

Update v0.7.3:
Updated spotlight CSS to take advantage of all horizontal space in page wrapper (RPS newly specified a max width for some reason)

Update v0.6.5:
