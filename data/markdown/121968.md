### Description
On December 15 2015, Goodreads implemented changes to its layout, resulting in many annoying surprises when navigating the site.

Here, I try to restore some things, such as header backgrounds to stop elements flowing into a single black-on-white mass, the square avatar in the main navbar, borders around reviews and profile info boxes and so on.

This may or may not conflict with future updates of the Goodreads Fix making the rounds. Right now, they work just fine on my end, however.
