### Description
SPECIAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - DO NOT INSTALL WITH STYLISH

Quick Tabs for Chrome is a great extension, and a major upgrade in February 2015 lets you search bookmarks as well as tabs. But the single-column popup requires lots of scrolling.  This stylesheet creates a bigger, wider popup with tabs across 3 columns. Open tabs are shown with a white background; recently closed tabs are dimmed but readable; bookmarks are light green.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - IMPORTANT!

This code does not install with stylish; you will copy it directly into the extension.

1. First, you must install the Quick Tabs extension from the Chrome store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb

2. Once it's installed, right-click on the extension in your Chrome toolbar, and choose "Options"

4. Copy the CSS from this page and paste it into the section labeled "Custom CSS"

5. Click "Apply Changes." Enjoy the new look!
