Based on style 6430, I made some modifications.

First: Now this skins supports the about:, about:blank and about:neterror pages on Firefox
Second: I made a new design on the neterror page container bg
Third: This is the most important mod that I made. Now you can "change" the color background. There is a field on the css where you can change the hex code.

html {
       background-color:#xxxxxx  !important;
}

You can choose what color is more convenient for your skin.

I made a "bright" version on this page: style 6543

Note: This is a "light" version of the CSS. The original one can be found here: http://snowpato.googlepages.com/aboutdark.css

/*UPDATE: 10/08/08: Fixed the background size for FF3
