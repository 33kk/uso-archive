### Description
For Firefox 8+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

This style replaces the default favicon on New/Blank tabs, about:home tab and bookmarked sites that do not have a favicon when in the Urlbar, on the Bookmarks Toolbar, in the Bookmark folders, and in the Bookmark Sidebar with a Fx Nightly logo icon.

Tested on Firefox 8+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora builds.
