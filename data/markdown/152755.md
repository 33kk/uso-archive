### Description
I decided to make a a dark theme for google as I didn't find one that quite fit me as the dark ones i found generally had too low of a contrast for my taste. So, why not share it if I already made it?

### Update notes
~ ~ Chistmas mode added ~ ~ 
it adds falling snow to google, it is disabled by default. To enable it  click the cog with the text "Advanced Style Settings" and enable it before installing the theme(if you already installed the theme, just reload the page and do the previous steps again)
~ ~ ~
1.1.4 some more knowledge panel changes, some elements don't appear with every search subject...
--
1.1.3
More "word meaning" cards changes
1.1.2
Some changes to the "knowledge bar" beside results
1.1.1
changes with elements related to embedded translate, featured snippets, "people also asked" and meaning snippets
1.0.5 yet again, a few elements that had eluded me appeared when I was looking for some benchmarks
1.0.4 the element for "other people searched" now themed. If there're still elements left to be themed, let me know and provide a link in which the element in question appears.
1.0.3 a few more elements added and solved a problem with domains. The way they were, other google sites would accidentally be partially themed (like google translate, for example) which wasn't intended.
1.0.2 had missed a few other elements related to news, and the column that appears beside results with some searches
1.0.1 I themed some elements I had left out, like the [PDF] tags and embeds of google translate

Hopefully everything should be fine. Some checkmarks, the grid icon and the photography icon look like that as they seem to external resources that can't be modified with css
