### Description
You can watch the video, read the comments and browse the related videos at the same time.
I made it for my monitor and for Chrome but if you are interested I will add 2540x1080, Firefox support (maybe it already has it, I did not test) and many more.
Please give me feedback, I'll try to fix any issues, and most importantly, enjoy! :)
