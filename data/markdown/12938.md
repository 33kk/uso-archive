### Description
Forces toolbar heights to be 27px. May distort some icons (see the favicon in the screenshot) but is generally a clean, comfortable way to get rid of unsightly excess padding if you find yourself unsatisfied with "tiny" themes.

The folder icons in my bookmarks toolbar were hidden using style 11876
