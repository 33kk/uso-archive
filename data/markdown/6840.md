### Description
Add your own custom image to the header of the Extensions Manager (AddOns) window in Firefox.   The custom image also appears on the window that pops up when you are installing a new extension (Software Installation).


Features:
- Centered Image
- Highly customizable
- Easy to modify
- Default image is a Firefox logo with text below saying rediscover the web.
- Another customization brought to you by -=Ben=-  (see Style 6488 for more styling on Firefox's windows)


Instructions:
In the CSS, change the website image I provided to the image you wish to display (.jpg or .png work best)

Additional Information:
This Style has been tested on multiple Firefox Themes, and has worked perfectly on each.
Upon code testing and research, you are unable to edit the background color of the header from white.  Suggestion is to either use a repeating PNG image, or use an image that takes up the entire header.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Added Code to use Encoded PNG Image (Now works offline)
+ Code Cleanup
