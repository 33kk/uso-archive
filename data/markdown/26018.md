### Description
This style requires that you first install style 19104. Thanks to user 25383! I recommend installing it with stylish, but be ready to disable it right away because it makes pages unreadable. Once you have installed both themes, enable them both, minimize Firefox and then restore it again and you should be ready to go.

This is an attempt to make ALL of the web transparent (except for Google, which you can do with style 19127). I know it works in Vista 32 bit with Aero theme enabled. I am currently using Firefox 3.6. I'm not sure how it works in Windows 7 or Vista 64. 

This is VERY preliminary, and since every web page is different, you may find dropdowns and dialog boxes hard to read. I would also recommend to set your background to black and font to white in Firefox Preferences: Tools -> Options -> Content -> Fonts and Colors -> Colors.

If you like this theme, or if you run into bugs, start a discussion on this page. I will continue to tweak this style, adding fixes and updates. 

Recent fixes: 
3/14/10 - Facebook popups
3/12/10 - Drupal 6 Admin Menu module
3/12/10 - Some common dropdowns and popups
