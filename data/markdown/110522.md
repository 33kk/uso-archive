### Description
For GardenWeb forum pages on Houzz. This style is limited to changing styles on the gardenweb.com domain and houzz.com/discussions (for when you get e-mails for links to discussions). It will not change the other areas of Houzz unless you edit the code. This style only affects layout, but can be used simultaneously with the color style sheet as well. The goal is simplify the layout and make it scaleable for smaller displays without horizontal scrolling.

### Update notes
<b>Update 3/19/2015:</b> Added back in code from other tablet testing style and deleted it. Option to set font size for everything on devices with width < 800px. Minor tweaks.

<b>Update 2/23/2015:</b> Window resizing should allow most content to wrap now instead of having to scroll horizontally. When the window width gets down to 800 pixels it should move the side area boxes of content to above and below the main area. I'm hoping that will help on tablets and phones vertical screens a bit, but you may want to make the font-size significantly bigger with the other style on those devices.

<b>Update 2/20/2015:</b> I added some code to keep the images in posts from being distorted or stretched.

<b>Update 2/19/2015:</b> I switched some of the set widths of things to use percentages instead so the site would scale down for smaller displays without horizontal scrolling. The navigation bar is simplified also.

I'm trying to make the layout more fluid for smaller displays.
