### Description
This theme aims to help more experienced players have a better experience playing. 

It removes things that are not needed necessarily such as:

- The "Attack" and "Switch" Text
- The Personal Trainer Sprite
- Borders between the gameplay and the battle log
- Long vertical boxes for each sides. 

It adds some quality of life changes:

- Maximizes open window space.
- Updated Sword and Shield Backgrounds
- Updated Weather Effects
- Information on Log is more distinguishable between types of information (Event & Damage) so that players can find important information faster when they scroll, hopefully. Separator line added to help further assist.
