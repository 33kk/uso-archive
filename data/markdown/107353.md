### Description
This theme allows you to fully customise crunchyroll to your liking. You can set your own background, change colors of the web elements and even change the shape of the edges of body elements. By default this style gives you a matte black look with an orange background, but you can change it all yourself.
To change the items just check the box of what you want to change. (These boxes are located above the install style button) and then change them to your liking.

The recommended size for a custom logo is 126px x 24px
