### Update notes
People have been messaging me a lot lately asking how to uninstall, that it's screwed up their Dashboards.  If you're using Stylish on Chrome (I'm assuming it'd be the same if you're using Stylish on Firefox), just click the icon and select 'Disable' and/or 'Delete' under the name of the theme.  I am not aware of how to uninstall themes on other add-ons, nor do I plan on finding out how -- it can't be that hard, yeah?
