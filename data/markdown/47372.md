### Description
This changes the Firefox buttons default dropdown tab style into a fully round-corner square button alongside the tabbar. I did this originally because the hangtab-style Firefox button floated off-screen on WindowBlinds themes. This is a modification of style 38988. Applies to both normal and maximized windows. NOTE: Resizing your browser is necessary once after installation for the button and tabs to align themselves to the new style.
