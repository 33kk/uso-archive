### Description
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle

As requested by Kreuger. 

Unfortunately I cant seem to get a very good link to OMG! Ubuntu and the site only finishes loading up once in a great while (and usually without the sites provided css). So needless to say progress has been slow, and I havn't had much opportunity to test it out and make sure everything works as desired and nothing is missing.

If you have any issues please comment and include the url, so I know where to focus.
