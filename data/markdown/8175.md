### Description
"Rounded" version of Luc's Yahoogroups style hack. Removes all images, ads, footer and most of the header. Also changes colors and font sizes. The same as my style 8166, but with rounded corners and a little more space separating table cells.

To do: my very first attempt; need to make it cleaner.
To do: alternative color schemes for people who have no clue about CSS editing.
