### Description
A Personal style that allows you to alter the color and rounding of your Tab's, menu, Toolbars and Text.
This one is made to work with Vertical Tabs and (preferably) no theme or persona.

Based on style 33570 by user 838

Made this cause my tabs weren't colored correctly with the use of:
Vertical Tabs (0.8) https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/
style 33773 (by user 15980)

**Also This is my first submitted style**

Things on the To-Do list:
- More colors to select?

### Update notes
Updated Style code
Added code so this style looks good when style 33773 isn't installed. (Re-)Added 3D Shininess from user 838 's style To make the tabs look good again. (instead of plain black)
Got the code for the Tabbar Background. Thanks Ohne.

Added more settings for Toolbar painting. :D
Added settings to recolor your Tabs. :D
Statusbar text color can be selected separately. :D
Statusbar Background can be selected separately. :D
