### Description
This style adds a thick top and bottom border to the first new post in topics made in SMF (Simple Machines Forum)-based forums, in order to make it easier to see where the first new post has been made.  If the first new post is the first one on the page, its border will be dotted; otherwise, its border will be dashed.
