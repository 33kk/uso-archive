### Description
<mark><b>Important: Click the "Show CSS Code" button first. The install button will work after that. I highly recommend this <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/">style</a> that makes the "Show CSS Code" button much easier to find.</b></mark> â€• This style removes the Second Life ads and increase the width of your feed and fix the navigator panel and the left panel to your screen for a better browsing experience. This style also increase the size of the thumbnails from small to large and some more other features as well. Read the additional information for further details.
