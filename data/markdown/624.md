### Description
Based on Kupfel's Google Logo Replacer Advanced. I think this can be further generalized & abbreviated with moz-document regex type stuff (eg, all tld's, all search types (in proxomitronese:) \w.google.\w(.\w)+/\w\? ____However I noticed Kupfel has also drilled into table child selector structure (which I've simply copied along with most of rest of Kupfel's filter)____So for now....___I *think* you can edit for your google tld as appropriate (eg, google.de becomes google.co.uk)
