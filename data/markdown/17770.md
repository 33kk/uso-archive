### Description
This splits myYearbook homepage to two columns instead of 3.

WARNING! For this to work PROPERLY, you need to move all the boxes in the LEFTMOST column to any of the two other columns BEFORE you apply this style or you won't be able to access those boxes till you disable the style again.

Sidenote: This also removes the safety tips from the home page.
