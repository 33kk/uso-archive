### Description
<b>NOTE: As of 01.01.2013 this style will no longer be supported.</b>
This style was designed for almost any theme with no adjustment. The buttons are clear, allowing whatever background they are placed upon to show through. All screenshots show multiple styles, from original blue opaque to completely transparent backgrounds.

The purpose of this style is to provide little extras that may have been overlooked in other styles. The extras include:
- replacing the big green 'Following # people' with a slimmer, colorized version to match the theme
- styling the Radar to remove the blue background frame and rounding the corners of the photo/video
- turning the 'Add / Remove' category list into a button selection system. Also, it bids farewell to that hideous green selection bar!
- providing rounded corners for just about everything that could be found
And lots of other little things you'll notice along the way.
