### Description
BEYOND OUR CONTROL:  (due to overlap of images and resizing)
You may no longer be able to compare Before and After images very well with new Stylish version and formatting, unless you turn off all styling with "Read Easily" extension or using View (Alt+V) --> Page Style --> No Style,  or anything else that will toggle CSS style on/off.   
---

Will downsize screenshots that exceed window width and will align them vertically, if necessary,  so you should be able to see most screenshots in their actual size instead of resized pictures side-by-side.  If the fullsize screenshots don't fit side by side they will be shown vertically, and may then be downsized to fit window, you can view them fullsize by hovering the cursor over the image, or by using context menu "View Image".    You can use the arrow keys to navigate within a hovered image.   To keep mouse away from hovering on images and changing size when comparing images, suggest keeping the cursor on the vertical scrollbar.
