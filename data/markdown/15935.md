### Description
Removes the ugly, fat and useless green bar with the company name of the SSL extended validation certificate in it, displays the favicon directly in the url bar like Firefox 2 did. I've made the star icon (not-bookmarked state) have a white background so that it is easier to see whether the page is bookmarked or not.

If you like the new box around the favicon, you can comment out the last part, or the last two if you want to keep the green/blue favicon background.

(If you don't have stylish: copy this into your userChrome.css (instructions: http://kb.mozillazine.org/userChrome.css) )

CHANGELOG:
2009-03-18: added white star icon
2010-09-19: exclude sites with ssl level=broken
