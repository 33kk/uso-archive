### Description
Just an icon adaptation of; http://userstyles.org/styles/5704 , credits goes there...

Although it's named Grease-Monkey, I don't like to see a monkey lol'ing me all the time.
Since UserScripts.Org FavIcon represents scripting "more accurate" than the monkey IMHO,
I simply adapted above userstyle with UserScripts FavIcon... 

If you don't like the colors of the icons, simply download http://userscripts.org/images/script_icon.png, 
open it with a decent image editor with png transparency support plus hue/saturation controls.
Play it as you like and re-encode it with http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp.
Then replace the desired icon with your version and remember to share it here ;-) ...
