### Description
This is an extensive restyling of the trac project management project specifically for the Bazaarvoice trac implementation.  It was patterned after some company specific aps created by coworkers.  I'm calling it a beta because at the time uploading nobody but me has used it. 

WARNING:  The @-moz-document domain() is set to work with the sample trac site at http://www.hosted-projects.com/trac/TracDemo/Demo. The @-moz-document domain() will need to be changed in order for this user style to work with any other trac implementation.  Also, because this style was created specifically for my employers implementation of trac I can't guarantee that it will behave as I intended with others.

This version was created on Firefox 3 for Windows XP.   Usage on other Firefox versions or platforms may result in undocumented behavior.
