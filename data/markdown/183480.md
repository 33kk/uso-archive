### Description
A dark theme for the Stylus extension.  Colors are adjustable via the variables set on :root.

Style was derived from #142272.  Updated for usage of variables rather than just colors.  Unfortunately, this styling potentially affects additional Firefox extensions, due to UserStyles failing to parse hyphens for a URL prefix...

Any issues?  Additional websites to add?  Want to check out my other dark theme styles?  Let me know by contacting me through my social media (and please provide a screenshot if possible): https://www.queengoob.org/darkthemes
