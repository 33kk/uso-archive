### Description
This stylesheet will move the search bar up into the empty space, and widen the 'appBar' to fill the space, revealing more links :)

I've set the width of the appBar in percentages, so on some resolutions it might be too wide (or narrow) - just change the value to your liking (by default it's set to 92%)

Updated to fix recent change to search bar position on August 5th.
