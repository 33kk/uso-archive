### Description
This is the "dim" version of my Good-ish Twitter style located here: https://userstyles.org/styles/173836/good-ish-twitter-2019

Get a little bit of the old "good" Twitter feeling back. Basically combine the best parts of the old layout with the best parts of the new application.

Moved navigation to a top bar instead of left-side column, with better notification indicators in the menu, and an overall "tighter" appearance. A few less severe curves and "bubbles," and a gray background to frame your timeline. Plus some other modifications to clean things up.
