### Description
*ATTENTION* This style will no longer be supported by me.  Now that the site does not host actual manga, I have no reason to go there.

-

This is a black version of OneManga with blue links.  I've removed ads and cleared up some space by removing useless (in my opinion) elements of the site, such as the select boxes on the top of every page and the welcome message in the side content that you see on every page.

I've also cleared up the space when viewing manga, hiding anything which took up space but wasn't very useful.

Please report any bugs, and feel free to make suggestions.

In order to use the blue banner you need to uncomment the banner replacement code.

1. Find this line: "/* [Banner] -uncomment this to get the blue banner- */"
2. Remove the "/*" right below it
3. About ten lines down, right below the "}", remove the "*/"

--UPDATES--

(Updated June 1st, 2009)
Completely rewrote the style in order to allow for greater customization for each page.

Changes:
-Fixed a bug which hid the manga description while viewing the chapter list.
-Removed extra space between the first and second news entries.
-Brought back the news titles.
-Widened the content of "Recent Updates", "Contact Us", and "Request Manga" to fill in the empty space after removing the pointless welcome message.
-Recolored some select and text boxes.
-Brought back the "report broken image" link.
-Recolored the site banner, though because of the size I was unable to integrate it into the style.  It is being hosted on imageshack.us, in order to use it you must uncomment the replacement code near the bottom of the style.

The image-replacement broke some time ago but I just barely got around to fixing it.

The banner image-replacement broke once again.  For whatever reason the address of the banner keeps changing, so instead I'm now targeting the image based off of its width.

This fix should last until they update their site layout.
