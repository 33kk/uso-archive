### Description
Aka FIX THAT RIDICULOUSNESS. Comes with eight options for customization. For more images of options visit DA page.

### Update notes
1.0 1-14-17
1.0.1 3-17-17

Release notes:

1.0.1 Fixes image scaling in shrinkthumbs (and by "fixes" I mean "stops stretching and compressing everything to 150x150", but they still won't scale properly, thanks DA), fixes a font color in journal-with-background artist info

1.0 Options for:
~showing the info all the time (aka the entire reason you're here)
~shrinking the thumbnails to 150x150 pixels max
~forcing a solid background and stat recolor on journal/literature thumbs for contrast and readability purposes
~recoloring the fav corner and/or recoloring the black fade on deviation thumbs to dark green
~hiding the fav corner and/or the stats (this will override the last two options)
~reducing the padding
~forcing the stats to always appear (please note that although this works, it's not super pretty, and is especially not-pretty if you also shrink the thumbs) (this will override the padding)
~forcing the fav corner to always appear
