### Description
The LiveVideo.com Cleanup Project.

Removes everything except the "who's live?" bar and custom "header image".
I can't get rid of the two images at the top(researching a way)(im using adblock to get rid of them currently).
Yahoo Live background looks weird if someone has a header image(working on removing header images).

Tips: Zoom in with your browser, especially if your using high resolutions. This makes all the difference.
