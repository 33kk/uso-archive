### Description
Displays hidden metadata and links to code files in a popup that overlays the page header.

### Update notes
Hover over the 'pancakes' icon to open the metadata header. 

On the left is style metadata - the style name and ID, the author's user ID, and the subcategory (unless style 121473 has borrowed it). This is the same information as shown by style 93025, it's just in a different place.

On the right are links to related sources - the install files for Firefox and Chrome, the example URL, the style metadata in JSON format, and the stylesheet checksum used to check for updates.

When looking at your own style with the metadata header is closed you'll see the 'Edit', 'Delete', and 'Stats' links in the bottom-right corner of the header. I've moved the 'Delete' link away from the other two for a margin of safety. (<kbd>margin: safety;</kbd> - bwahaha!)

You'll find the User Agent string appended to the browser logo in each forum post. I've simply copied style 106026 here for convenience, so I can find all the metadata stuff in one place.

2015-12-13: Another style also uses <kbd>#subcategory</kbd>. Update style 121473 to resolve the conflict.
2015-12-13: Update URLs with style settings now display properly. Also, <kbd>text-overflow:ellipsis</kbd> instead of <kbd>clip</kbd>.
