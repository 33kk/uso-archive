### Description
So many of these damned news websites have these stupid videos playing, unnecessary sidebars, recommended videos for some reason, and moving page titles that scroll when you're reading more of the article. Part of me thinks it because they need some way to keep the attention span of 20 year olds. Anyway, here you go. The Independent website, but not shitty.
