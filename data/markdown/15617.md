### Description
Applies to: Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikiquote, Wikibooks, Wikinews, Wikiversity, and other Wikimedia projects.
Adds English names for the language links in the sidebar.
If the English exonym and autonym is similar (identical or just with some diacritics), they are commented out.

If there are any politically incorrect exonyms, I will correct them.
I usually use my own customized version so I might be missing a few things.
Some languages have alternative names commented out.
Suggestions, questions and other language versions are welcome.
Japanese version: style 15963
