### Description
The new site design I find quite grotesque, I mean- that green is appalling colour choice and the general feel is just horrible.

I basically did the best simple job I could restoring a nice red theme alike the old design whilst retaining the functionality, I also removed the current tab effect where the current category and forum is displayed with { } 's, didn't find those very attractive, a light grey colour highlighting what page you're on I found much more attractive and suiting the rest of the design.

Enjoy!

- Updated header logo selector and float to avoid replacing the Christmas Competition banner (and hopefully any future banners).

Merry Christmas!
