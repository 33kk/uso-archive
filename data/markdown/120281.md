### Description
This is a duplicate of an existing theme made by Heo Siu Nhun (Firebug Dark Theme (beta))

The toolbars used to be changed to a different color, but now they don't seem to be.  I went to GitHub and found the source as well as the new entries needed to re-color the toolbars to be the same as the rest of the theme.

My edits are at the top of the script.
