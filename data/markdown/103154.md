### Description
A simple code to hide freeform tags on ArchiveOfOurOwn until you hover over the links (or highlight them to view them all at once). (I know you can change your account to have them "click to show additional tags," but this causes userscripts like AO3 Savior and Saved Filters not to work properly - so this is a quick fix to get around that while still hiding additional tags.)
