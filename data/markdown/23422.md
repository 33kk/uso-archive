### Description
Firefox fix for:

on any ebay auction, using the new format, click the + under the main image to enlarge, a new viewing pane opens and I cannot rt. click on the image and save it, -unless- there is only one image. If there are several images displayed on the right side in thumbnails, the only way I can rt. click and save image as, is to use IE.
