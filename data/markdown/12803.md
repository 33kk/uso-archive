### Description
Updated to remove the "Your ad here" box.

Updated on December 21 2012 after iSketch added the ringtone.

This removes the buttons under the game screen and the ad and everything else displayed at the bottom (at least until they change the page or url again).

I moved the game window to the top left of the screen and also changed the background colour to grey.
