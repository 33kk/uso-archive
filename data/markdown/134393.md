### Description
so a family member with autism told me that recolor.me was upsetting them becaue of all the avatar extras and the backgrounds. just too much sensory info for them, so i eliminated all that and fixed jason's mistakes by having too much stuff on the home page. it might look nice to most but it bothers some autistic people so i fixed it for a family member
