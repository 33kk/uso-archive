### Description
Makes CF easier to read by softening colors, improving fonts, narrowing the thread width and more. 

Works properly only on top of CF's "original" theme, which is now not the default. That means that you will have to register and choose the Original theme in CF user preferences for this Style to work right. Feedback welcome.

This may work for other Xenforo sites that have a theme where the User Info bar in above each post.  Also check out my other easy read style sheets. Blessings.
