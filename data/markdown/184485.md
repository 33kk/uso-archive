### Description
Based on the original by Poorchop, that tries to keep the 'stock' HN style just making it a basic dark mode that won't assault your eyes at night.

This version changes the syntax to fix warnings and to improve the upvote arrow that is broken on the original due to changes in recent browsers. New version uses a CSS-only implementation of the upvote button instead of an image and allows user customization for its color.

Here's the recommended colors:
Use #6F6F6F for gray upvote arrow.
Use #FF6600 for orange upvote arrow.
