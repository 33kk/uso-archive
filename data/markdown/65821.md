### Description
This is the Midnight Caek color scheme from the <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/56312/oneechan">OneeChan</a> 4chan style. Don't install this style. This style is for me only and this is just where I post it. You can install it if you want, but I'm not gonna change anything for anyone but myself. Sorry.

### Update notes
Update: Removed arrows on the sides of posts, and made all replies equal width.
Update: Okay, I fixed the postform width for real this time.
Update: Fixed the delete form.
Update: Made Quick Reply form wider.
Update: 4chan updated its FAQ page, so I updated the CSS.
Update: 4chan updated with more features and a different quick reply, styled accordingly.
Update: Fixed styling on /rs/ and /f/, they were oddly coded
Update: Fixed input fields for the "4chan Pass" form
Update: Since I use a 4chan Pass, this style blocks out the Captcha part of the posting page. Just remove the commented line to re-enable the Captcha.
Update: Added the option to disable Captcha or not.
Update: Changed various red text to white text, fixed an irritating quirk in the footer.
Update: Changed border color around logo to white.
Update: AdBlock Plus wasn't hiding the ads for some reason, so I just display:none'd them.
Update: Opacity:0'd hr tags. Should look much cleaner now.
Update: Display:none'd the reply stubs of hidden threads, made the board links bigger
Update: Made the text boards look nicer, and made .boxcontent text bigger.
Update: Now colors change when a post is highlighted.
Update: Fixed an obnoxious bug. Boards should feel more natural now.
Update: did a thing
4/9/14: Hid the Blotter table, fixed link and quote colors
5/9/14: Made the post form completely visible, hid the "New Thread" and "Post Reply" links
<b>8/20/14: Fixed the postform width for the new "Options" field</b>
