### Description
This shows an image on the about:newtab page. 

You would have to enable the display of this page in about:config, by setting browser.newtab.url to "about:newtab" and you should also set browser.newtabpage.enabled to "false", which would remove those thumbnails to frequently visited websites ("quickdial"), that don't go together with the minimalist concept of showing this image instead. 

The image encoded in this style is transparent, so editing the value for 'background-color' will change the background color. The current value is "ThreeDFace". Any bright color should look ok. 

The image was taken from a website that was associated with the work of philosopher Ken Wilber ( http://integrallife.com http://www.kenwilber.com ). The image was light grey on black background but i inversed the colors.
