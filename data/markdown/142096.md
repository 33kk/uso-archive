Before you write a bad review, make sure that you have the latest version (by clicking on update button to manually update it) or check out recent issues on GitHub. I have no power over what gets broken, but I do fix the issues very quickly. Changelog available at <a href='https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/blob/master/changelog.org'>Github</a>.

If you really like the project and would like to tip me for my work, then you can buy me a coffee over at <a href='https://ko-fi.com/vednoc'>ko-fi</a> or support me over at <a href='https://liberapay.com/vednoc'>LiberaPay</a>.

I can't log into USo forum to reply to comments, but I do read them. Report issues on GitHub, my email, or my Discord. Sorry for the inconvenience, there's really not much I can do.
