### Description
Strips away all superfluous and distracting graphics and elements on the page. Just leaves a simple and basic dictionary.
<ul>
<li>Static search bar at the top (the search bar always annoyingly moves around depending on the page, on the normal site).</li>
<li>Removed graphics and replaced with CSS "content" symbols (e.g. the 'audio' icon for mp3 links is replaced with the unicode symbol for 'audio').</li>
<li>CantoDict Parser's page is also stripped and simplified.</li></ul>
This theme is for <strong>Cantonese only</strong>; this removes all pinyin and Mandarin.
Works with Safari: just copy the CSS to a file and use that stylesheet in you 'advanced' Safari settings.
加油呀！
