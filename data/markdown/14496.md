### Description
In February of 2009, Gmail introduced new style buttons and new "Labels" and "Move To" menus that lets you apply multiple labels faster and label and archive e-mails with just 2 clicks. The maximum height of these menus is 200 pixels, so if you use a lot of labels you have to scroll down the list. This script changes that maximum height to 500 pixels, making it faster to apply labels to e-mails if you use a lot of labels.

R.I.P. Scrollbars!

Updated March 6th, 2009 - CSS code changed in Gmail... Should be fine now.
