### Description
A simple yet powerful style to darken Nyaa.se / Nyaa.eu while staying largely faithful to its original design.


Chrome and its variants have some issues with gradients that stretch across multiple table cells (which is only the case at the main torrent lists), so I added an optional slightly modified version which removes these specific gradients and shows just solid colors instead.
