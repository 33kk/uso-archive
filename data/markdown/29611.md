### Description
You know how on almost every layout, including the LJ-default white-and-sky-blue one, if you have a long comment thread, then before too long,

it'll
start
doing
this
crud
with
single-
word
columns
on
the
right?

And you have to scroll down like five pages just to read one paragraph, or something? Ugh, I hate that.

So I fixed it.

I'd rather scroll sideways a tad sooner, and be able to read a bit of text horizontally, than just vertically.

This fix works just on the LJ-default white-and-sky-blue layouts... or at least, it's supposed to work on only those.  It sets the minimum comment width to 200 pixels.
