### Description
Google is evil. Ask.com has better privacy-policy. But it's search-results tend to be somewhat confusing. This is my attempt to make it a bit better:

- Number-Count in front of Search-Results
- Removal of "More" and "My Stuff" Menus (only used by registered users)
- Complete left Sidebar removed
- Space of Left Sidebar given to main search-results
- Sponsored Links/Results removed (see http://userstyles.org/styles/4074)
