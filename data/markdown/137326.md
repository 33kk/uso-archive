### Description
This is as clean as it gets! The only thing you see is text. This was designed for serious writers and anyone who hates distractions. The interface is hidden away but it's there when you need it. It features a clean drop down header and a very unique pop up search. It defaults to a medium dark theme that's easy on the eyes and perfect for long writing sessions. However if you want something different, the CSS is very organized and makes color and other adjustments as simple as possible. You can find more info and tips in the notes.
