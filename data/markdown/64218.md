### Description
Modification of the new (April 2012) Google+ design for higher desktop resolutions (1280px wide or more). The stream content is centered and wider, but it also contains several tweaks or modifications such as removing the ugly black background on inline images in posts and many other, and also fixes some bugs/problems on Google's side in Opera. There's also a slightly different version of this style with normal width chat bar available from me.

Made primarily with Opera 11.6x in mind, but tested in current Chrome and Firefox as well.
