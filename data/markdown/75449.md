### Description
This style tries to address some of the accessibility issues introduced with the "new" blogger interface introduced by Google in 2011/2012. The low contrast and generous spacing, among other things, makes the interface very hard to use for users with visual and/or information processing problems. Some users report getting headaches from trying to work with it.

Google has largely ignored the concerns of such users. Which, to my mind, is a good reason to not use blogger (whether you personally have the problem or not), but some users have invested a lot of work into making their blog work on blogger, and don't have the time, energy, or <a href="http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/BYDLS-TheSpoonTheory.pdf">spoons</a> to look for another solution and recreate their templates, import their old posts, and so forth.

This style is for all these people. It tries to make things better by making them look more like the "old" blogger interface.
