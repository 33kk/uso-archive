### Description
Pimp.my.Gmail series!
If you prefer a script, check out : http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/75047

This style will pimp up the Gmail chat. It will replace the default smileys with the ones from the tango project.
It will also replace some hidden ones not accessible by the smiley menu ;)

PS: You need to have emoticons enabled for this to work.
If you can point me to better/more smileys than the ones covered here, i'll be glad.
