### Description
Removes most of the ads, the one in the sidebar (main page only) stays.
This was simply because it's a non intrusive ad.

I'm thinking of adding some other tweaks (left aligning the user info in topics etc.)
Requests for features here: http://thevistaforums.com/index.php?/user/212-crank/ (PM me)

Features:
- Removes top ientry bar
- Removes header ad
- Removes right ad
  (not on the main page as explained above)
- Removes spacing
  (when using Adblock the ads are gone but the "ad-space" stays empty, this removes the empty space)
- And one hidden feature that nobody at all is going to find! :P

Known Bugs:
- Hidden feature causes the TVF on the Web box to disappear when active.
  (considered not important enough to fix)


Changelog:
- 0.8.23: trimmed the code, smaller filesize, easier to use the hidden feature
