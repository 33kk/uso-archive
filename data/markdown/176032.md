### Description
Grayscale skin affecting CSS Fixes Project for Dueling Nexus

For whatever reason, adding a grayscale feature does some weird shit! I was initially going for more of a yayness of grayness approach, but for some reason this came out. If you're in the mood, try this one out. It's trippy.

This is a skin that is designed to run on top of https://userstyles.org/styles/169750/css-fixes-project-for-dueling-nexus
