### Description
Updated for the 2017 Newsfeed. Updated to fix image positions. Updated to also fix image scaling optionally (edit the style source for instructions). This makes Facebook's Newsfeed take up the full page where the right-hand column (that nobody uses) usually goes. It also gets rid of all the useless links in the left-hand column. Enjoy distraction-free Facebook (not that Facebook isn't a distraction, but you get the point).
