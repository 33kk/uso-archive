### Description
Today was my YouTube changed to new layout, and I didn't like left align main page and video page. So I decide to fix this.

Main page is now centered and Video page has bigger player.

Video page works well only when is video player in extended (wide) mode, to make the change permanent you can use a cookie editor to lock "wide" to "2" or just click once on extended mode, then it should be permanent aswell.

EDIT 12/13/2012: - Style will not be updated from now on, for the best centered youtube style, I recommend style - http://userstyles.org/styles/79542/youtube-centered-updated-dec-13-2012
