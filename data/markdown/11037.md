### Description
Automatically hides the Uppity button based on your current navigation of the page.   

Features:
-If you cannot navigate (move) up, the uppity button is removed (and so is the dropmarker button).

* Thanks to user 1185 and user 1158 for their Back/Forward hiding styles - Where I got the idea.

Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser... only display when required!  
Works for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.
Why install an extension to do this, when you can do it through CSS!?

Works great with the Uppity Firefox Extension!
Requires you to install Uppity from Addons Mozilla .org

Integrates with Style 7577

Changelog:
- Initial Release
