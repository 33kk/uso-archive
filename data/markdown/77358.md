### Description
Turns Mweor's color scheme into dark grays with some orange accents. Also removes any dumb font effects people may use on the forums (such as strange colors, fonts, or small/large sizes).
***NOTE this WILL screw up cattery CSS but only to you; others will see whatever layout you had before you installed this skin.
***NOTE this only applies to the Default Green Skin
