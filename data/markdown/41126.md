### Description
I liked style 7008 by user 7807, however, it wasn't displaying properly in Chrome. So I took the base of it and fixed the display issues, then continued adding features and such. I'll continue to tweak and update (specifically on the sub-pages). 

Changes:
- Strikethrough text and transparent Row on tasks marked complete
- Made ViewBy bar and Add Task button fixed to top of window
- Changed Viewby bar appearance to better match Things app
- AddTask panel is pop up over the task list instead of top, pushing tasks downward. This allows it to show anywhere in list of tasks. You can scroll tasks behind the AddTask panel. Also added button backgrounds with hover/active states
- Drop shadows added to tooltips and head/toolbar areas for depth
- Removed images where possible and replaced with CSS gradients.
- More unified Header and Toolbars
- Set auto widths on task details to reduce empty space
- Proper spacing on TOC left nav
- Lots and lots of little details (example: darker drop shadow on hover state for each task, text-shadows to make some parts easier to read, etc.)
