### Description
Just a simple black theme for the creatures of the dark among us. This isn't a total dark theme, I only bothered to theme what's interfaced with the most for compatibility reasons and of course, meh. If you don't like being flashbanged with whiteness when loading pages, you can try a style like this one: https://userstyles.org/styles/44928/dark-grey-firefox-about-blank-about-newtab

Warning: Scrollbar color will change. You can disable this below if you like. 

Tested on Windows 10 w/ Firefox v47 & Ubuntu 16.04 (choose "linux" to fix a padding issue and custom "new tab" icon)

### Update notes
Update:

- Updated so that annoying white line doesn't display between FF UI and web content
- Not sure why but when I updated Windows, the toolbar bottom border pixel reverted to 1px size. Fixed.
- Sorry, had to revert last change as I noticed Page Info could be unreadable
- small update to fix color for those using treestyletabs
- added "blacker" option
- titlebar colored
- implemented a choice of colors for highlights and more colored scroll bars
- darkened the urlbar, searchbar, a bit more contrast and fixed active tab
