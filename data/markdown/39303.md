### Description
For Firefox 4 or later

This makes the buttons positioned in the tab bar look like tabs.

You can configure which tabs' appearance is modified. (Hint : apply the style several times with different parameters if you want a particular set of buttons.)

This is the Windows version.
Linux version here : style 60170
