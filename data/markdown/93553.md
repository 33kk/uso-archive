### Description
This style is now kind of obselete, since Australis become an official part of Firefox. If you are interested in a similiar style I suggest my newer one, namely <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/101023/clean-and-slim-australis-tested-on-linux">this</a>.

This style is only left here for historical purposes.


Based on my previous firefox userstyle (Immunity Australis), it is intended use is with Ziz4rD's <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/74301/firefox-australis-mockup-theme-ubuntu">Australis Mockup theme Ubuntu</a>. It was not tested with other OS-s, themes, but should probably work okay in other environments.
As you can see it slims down the toolbar and the tabbar, adds an Australisish back button, simple close buttons on the left of the tabs, and a rounded searchbar for good measure.
