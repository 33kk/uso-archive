### Description
Well I stay up late quite a bit and when I work in the dark with a bright screen my eyes start to hurt quite a bit, so in order to protect my eyes from harm I deiced to make a new browsing style.

This will affect all websites and this style isn't complete yet but I plan on perfecting it to the best I think is possible, since a lot of websites rely on their colors.

Anyways, right now it works fine.

Please report any bugs with light-boxes or popular websites!
Thanks!
