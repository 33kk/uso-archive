### Description
For those who don't like the new gmail look. It takes up too much space and there are no clear boundaries between different sections of the site. This style tries to overcome these issues.

Changes
----------------------------
- Ads Removed
- More Borders / Darker Borders
- Compact Header
- Compact Sidebar
- Compact Chat
- Labels on buttons instead of icons
- Some small changes here and there

v0.2 Fixes
---------------------------------
- Contacts menu is now accessible
- Chat list now won't overlap with chat search

Please note that this style is kind of an alpha version and tested only on Firefox 13.0a2, so don't expect it to work perfectly (works best in display density: cozy).
