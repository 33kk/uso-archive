### Description
So Gmail launches the new interface, decides that huge round buttons are the way forward, and other layout tweaks that simply do not do it justice. So i created a new tweak to the current new layout which is much more pleasing to the eye. This theme is friendly with or without backgrounds, both dark and light themes. Enjoy!
