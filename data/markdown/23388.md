### Description
This style adds a stiny (16x16px) thumbnail at the left of the link, if the link for example leads to some file of specific format.
This works to .exe, .msi, .mp3, .wma, .wav, .ogg, .flac, .m3u, .mid, .avi, .asf, .mov, .flv, .mpeg, .mpg, .wm, .wme, .mp4, .m4v, .wmv, .asx, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .svg, .gif, .png, .rss .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .txt, .rtf, .torrent, .xpi, .java, .css, .zip, .rar, .7z, .iso, .gz and to mailto: and https: links.

All the pics were taken from google picture search. If anyone can draw some beautiful and maybe similar to 1 style icons - you are welcome, just let me know if you can help me to make this style better. Also I will answer any of your questions here and if you have feature requests/bug tracks - let me know.

19.12.2009 Edit: removed java, as it makes a lot of ugly things, mostly on forums (reply mode), though I can edit this rule not to work on forums - I decided to remove it completely.

Just try to enable this style and look at these links:
