### Description
This style applies a simple invert filter because Polymer-based sites can't be restyled easily due to their heavy use of Shadow DOM and the only method of penetrating it available for userstyles was <a href="https://crbug.com/489954">removed</a> in Chrome. So the logos, icons, color accents are inverted as well.
