### Description
This style is primarly intended to fix those site I sometimes go on, but don't feel like making a dark theme for them.

I change default BG&FG color in firefox, but somes sites wrongly assume them to always be set to Black on White. Or just fix one on these two parameters. This leads to White on White pages, and so on.

This short css is here to fix this by restoring the default BG&FG colors as the sites wrongly assume them to be.
