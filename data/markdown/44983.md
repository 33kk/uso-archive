### Description
This is a mod of style 44447 by user 82707. I've altered its appearance so that it will work fabulously with style 36813. It can be used without Dryfus' theme, though.

(Most of the code was left intact for troubleshooting purposes. Feel free to tweak it as needed.)

Important!! -- If you're using style 36813, comment out the #appmenu-button related code in the Aero Clean style or there may be conflicts. (This is a really simple task.)

This style will also work with Pale Moon and other Firefox 4 derivatives.
