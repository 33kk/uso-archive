### Description
* shoutcast.com - clean dark grey redesign
 *
 * Author      : NeoVanGoth
 * Date        : February 16th, 2007
 * Description : Complete redesign of shoutcast.com, losely based on Valacars Google Web Search - dark grey redesign. 
                 Removed all unnecessary elements to get as much space as possible for the channellist. 
                 Removed the "results per page" on the right side too, because it isn't working anyway.
                 This is my first css redesign, so many elements may be redundant.
 * Todo        : Alternative for that ugly "tune in"-image.
 * Usage       : Use with Stylish Firefox extension (http://userstyles.org/) or copy to your Firefox userContent.css file
 * Thanks to   : Valacar for his great google redesign
