### Description
The Ubuntu forums.  Black.


NOTE: The code is too long, thus, I cut it in two.  Load this piece into Stylish, remove the ending brace '}' (KEEP THE "CUT-POINT"), get the other piece, located here: http://userstyles.org/styles/3993 and add it to the first piece.  (Remove the first two lines of the second piece.)
