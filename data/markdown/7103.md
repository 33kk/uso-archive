### Description
Undoes the recent changes to post contrast on the Steam forums, introduces the Calibri font if installed, and fixes a couple of long-standing CSS bugs regarding lists. (Now also undoes the bold weight of all post text. What the hell are they thinking?)

This doesn't and can't help with the new images!
