### Description
Change the default fixed-width font on Ask Fedora. The built-in (and apparently un-modifiable) Discourse default, Consolas, has poor differentiation between some characters. (Most notably, the lowercase-l and the numeral 1.) That makes it a poor font for displaying code snippets and such, which is a pretty critical need for this site.

### Update notes
By default, the userstyle will make Liberation Mono the default font, but it also gives you the option to select Lucida Console, Menlo, or Monaco, if you prefer those options.
