For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.

Hides the New Firefox App Menu Button on the Titlebar.

!Important! After applying this userstyle you may have to toggle the Window state from (Minimize to Maximize), so the style will appear correctly.

Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

Great for users of the "Personal Titlebar" extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/222214/ and "Personal Menu" 4.3.2 extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/personal-menu/versions/4.3.2
