### Description
White style for the very black "Dark Lyrics" website.  I use DarkLyrics to read-up on all the Metal band's lyrics.  This style makes readability very easy with vista's Calibri font, as well as the wonderful white, and black styling.

** An original style, made by me, user 7858!

Features:
- Calibri font, although supports XP and Windows 9x with the secondary font being Arial.  (if Calibri is not installed, the site will display in Ariel)
- White background for each page, table data, and paragraph
- WebSafe Orange as Hovered Hyperlink color
- WebSave Red as Visited hyper link color
- Light overall look (was dark, but is no longer!)

From DarkLyrics .com :
"Metal lyrics. Black death doom heavy power thrash metal hardcore grindcore. Lyrics of metal bands - over 11'000 full albums lyrics."

Integrates with the following Styles:
+ Style 6657
+ Style 7216


Future Updates:
- I plan to prevent the lyrics themselves from turning Blue and hovering to turn Red.  This will be implemented in a planned update.

Changelog:
- Initial Release
