### Description
Style for the AutoHotkey Community forum! Once again, getting rid of huge irritating margins and line heights, enlarging some mini-font-sizes and aligning unnessecary block-stacked elements. I reduced the content wrapper width for more density on topic pages, as opposed to the table of forum topics and search results, which are wider.
