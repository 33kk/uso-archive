### Description
Check out the next evolution of this userstyle: <a href=https://userstyles.org/styles/123572/ultra-minimal-firefox>Ultra Minimal Firefox</a>

--------------------------------------

Tried to make it as minimal and pretty yet functional as possible.

The URLbar will increase its width when it is focused (clicking on it) and will go back to its min-width when it is no longer being focused. This automatically applies when opening a New Tab.

Made a youtube video explaining how to make it look like in the reference pictures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42vDNTD2fUQ

### Update notes
By simply installing this userstyle, you won't get the result that shows in the pictures. Follow these instructions if you want it exactly like I have it.

- You'll have to install the Classic Theme Restorer Addon for Firefox (CTR): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/
- CTR: In the Tabs section, choose Squared Tabs (australized) and Tabs not on top V2. Also, change the tab height to 50px, min-width to 100px and max-width to 250px.
- CTR: In the Tabs & Colors section, in the Default tab, for text, I chose #CCCCCC color.
- CTR: In the Application button section, choose Disabled button from the dropdown.
- CTR: In the General User Interface section (1), enable Combine buttons reload-stop.
- CTR: In the General User Interface section (2), in Inverted Icons, enable Tabs bar and White color for tabs buttons (close, new, groups, list all).
- CTR: In the Location Bar section, enable hide buttons "Relad", "Stop", "Go" and Notification icon when an emergent window is blocked.
- CTR: In Toolbars (2) section, enable Navigation Toolbar: hide toolbar.
- Go to Personalize and hide all bars. Move the URLbar next to the tabs. Place the "Stop" and "reload" (in that order) buttons next to the URLbar. Place the "Button Separator" after it. Place bookmarks, home, downloads and menu buttons at the opposite end.
- Download the theme MaDonnas Blue Green: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/blue-green/
- Widths were based in the WIndows 10 interface. You can change them to what best suits you. 
- You can also change the colors and other things if you want to use an other theme. Just open the style with the Stylish addon and go to the end of the style where it says "STANDARD OPTIONS". I placed there the things, that if edited, won't change the overall look of the style much. I added a few brief explanations there too.

Because of the language of my browser and thus the localization of the CTR addon that I have, I might not have referenced the addon's option quite accurately. I still hope you can get the context of them.

Based on a Google Chrome redesign concept: https://www.behance.net/gallery/Google-Chrome-Project/4456341

Thanks to Aris for having done such a great addon (Classic Theme Restorer). It just isn't possible without it.
