### Description
Cleans up the colors and narrows the conversations list as Inbox did.
It is not possible to bundle the conversations like Inbox did with CSS, but I'm looking into an extension I could build to bring back that 

Note: I reccomend disabling the tabs Gmail offers for a cleaner look.
