### Description
Since the last update, the overhead menu on dA drastically changed, making many people feeling uncomfortable with the new menu arrangement. Obviously, the site`s staff doesn`t give a damn about the people`s plead, so this is my solution for the problem. It positions the buttons on their previous places, so you could feel comfortable again. It also removes the "premium membership" button and the shop button. I feel better when I don`t see buttons or menus asking for my money.
