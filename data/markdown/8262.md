### Description
Greatly condenses the Navigation Bar when the extension "Download Helper" is installed.  Removes Horizontal padding, making the toolbar very small and minimal.  Excellent style for those who want to conserve screen real-estate.  Works on Firefox2 AND Firefox3 !!

Download Helper is the firefox extension that allows you to download Flash (flv) Videos from Sites like YouTube, Google Video, metacafe... and countless others.

Applies to:
- Firefox 3
- Firefox 2 

Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.
Works for BOTH Firefox 3 AND Firefox 2.

Changelog:
1.0.0.3:
+ Fixed Margins to Center the Icon both Vertically and Horizontally.
* Remember, this is a toolbar-compression style.  It squishes the icon a bit to compress the space used.  It was either squish the icon or make the icon too small to see.

1.0.0.2:
+ Added Code to remove the border and line margin from around the download helper icon.
+ Now takes up even less space.

1.0.0.1:
