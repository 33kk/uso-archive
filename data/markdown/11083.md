### Description
Replaces "Back Is Close" button image for Firefox 3 with an 'X'

* Thanks entirely to user 5335 for the style 4493.  My style is based on this, but works for Firefox 3's Large Icons!

Back is Close is an amazing extension, allowing you to close a tab when you hit the back button (when you cannot go back any further). 

Features:
- Red Background circle X, with a White Cross
- Removed back is close dropmarker, so the button is circular
- Re-positioned the width, so the toolbar button looks good in regular mode, or Small Icon mode
- Displays a smaller and better close toolbar button
- The image can be easily customized, and the image I used came from Firefox's Chrome!

Applies to:
- Firefox 3

*Requires the Back Is Close extension, that can be found (in Beta) here: 
http://diffenbach.org/back-is-close/latest/back_is_close-1.5beta-fx.xpi

Integrates with Style 8931.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Added rounding to the button, updated After screenshot to match.
+ Now the button looks like the Native Firefox Back Button!
