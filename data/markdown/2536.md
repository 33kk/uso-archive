### Description
This style tweaks the BetterSearch "preview" box.  It changes:

1) the margin color
2) the border size and color
3) width and height

The width and height are set for the search results (indented and unindented) as seen on a resolution of 1680x1050.  I might suggest that you play around with these values to better suit your needs, especially if you have a screen resolution different from that.

I might suggest that you apply this in combination with one of my other styles style 2535, which does not break this style's layout.
