### Description
Tweaks the updated (since Spring 2017) WordPress.org Plugin Directory to make it usable again on Desktop computers. No more stupid "Read more" toggles and other helpful tweaks, not only for power users.

This style was created to speed up the research for plugins for developers, site builders, journalists - to get a better overview, faster. It uses more colors, more contrast to make various sections better differentiate from other other areas/ sections.

Sections it tweaks:
- Plugin listings / archives
- Single plugin view
- User profiles (of authors)
- Support forums / Review boards
- Theme listing
- Single theme view
