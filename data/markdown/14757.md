### Description
It makes the new ft.com layout more readable, by shrinking the font size and tightening up the layout.

Sorry , the only "after" I have is a 210kb jpeg, but I can assure you it at least presents more information on a page than previously. Give it a shot see how it works for you. Fell free to tweak, let me know and I'll test it and update it if I like it, or just post your own version regardless :)
