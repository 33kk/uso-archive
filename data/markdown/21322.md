### Description
Requires Helvetica Neue Light, so Mac only.

Now that Google has increased the font size in the search bar, the resulting aesthetic feels a little bit clumsy.  Refining this look, this style simply addresses the text in the search bar, the suggested results, and the actual search results.  Support for every Google domain out there.
