### Description
If you type an incomplete command in the Developer Toolbar, Firefox gives you suggestions for the complete command.  This happens even if you press [Space-Bar] and then press [Enter].  You may navigate though the options with the arrow keys and select by pressing [Tab].  This fixes: (1) The presentation balloon may not fit in the allocated space and show in an ugly box with scroll bars.  (2) If you use the light theme, no item shows highlighted when you navigate with the arrow keys.
