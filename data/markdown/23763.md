### Description
Likke the name says, it places the All-In-One Sidebar under the tabbar.
This solution differs from the AIOS author and schall work with most(maybe all) themes.

Have found a better way to move it down, doesn't cause the tab drop indicator to move out of space anymore.

doesn't work with multiple tabrows
