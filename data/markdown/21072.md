### Description
See Also: style 21152

If you are using the uCern wiki (not a public site) and would like the paragraph/regular font size to be larger, this script will boost it to 12px. If you want a different size, simply edit line 11:

font-size:12px !important; 

The script also removes the "min-width" value in of the column containing content, allowing the text to wrap more narrowly.

2009-09-21: Added a line for changing the table font size so that it is also bigger. Also boosted wiki-text editor font size.
