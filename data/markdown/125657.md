### Description
A theme for Discord that allows you to set a background image that will display underneath the page. Uses a frosted-glass effect on supported browsers, and applies an overlay so text is still readable. <strong>Currently only supports dark mode - Discord's light theme breaks it a bit. This is being worked on.</strong>
