### Description
This is for Akina Nakamori official website, FaithWay.
URL: http://nakamoriakina.com/

This css especially affects on Gallery page: Positions of the link to go forward or backward are changed to upper part of each page so that it's easy to move. The original positions depend on the photo size.

Also, I change the left-side menu link including the official icon on top of it to be stable.

I hope this tiny changes make you comfortable there.
