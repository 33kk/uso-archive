### Description
Rainbow/candy colour minimal Dynalist theme. Compilation of tweaks from the Dynalist forums with my customized rainbow colour scheme.

1.2
Add rating system tags. Misc. tweaks.

1.1
General update with changes I've made over the past few months: tweaked code formatting ('```' code that got updated Jan. 2020 hasn't been implemented yet, so it's still default, '`' code works though), added @est tag (for estimate time with my tag time-tracking system), elaborated on the fact that my emoji-tags get eaten by UserStyles.org so if you want them you have to implement them yourself, fixed overdue colour to match colour-scheme.
