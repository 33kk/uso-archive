### Description
This is the dark version of a series of styles trying to ease access to the website xmlsoft.org (along with libxml2 documentation) so that the user's eyes won't go mad after some minutes. The capabilities for restyling xmlsoft.org are rather restricted because this website uses really ancient techniques (tables!) and does not add class or id attributes to tags.
