### Description
This was just a personal style but i saw there was no style for this site,so i uploaded it.Got rid of a lot of stuff including xxx button,footer,header,rss button(but i get a little one on urlbar and top right of window)...moved things about a bit,widened page.Didn't flash it up much.Does not work with autopager.It does,but u get corrupted stuff at top of screen,so if u use autopager,best to disable for this site,unless u want to put up with visual bugs.It's not my best styling code by a long way,but i just wanted to get it done.
