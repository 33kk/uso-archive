### Description
Inspired by the upcoming new design of BatchBook seen here (http://support.batchbook.com/discussions/updates-announcements/9-sneak-peak-at-upcoming-bb-redesign-browse-contacts), I thought to put something together modifying the existing site until they launch the new design.  Feel free to submit suggestions or requests as this was put together quickly & the entire site hasn't been scoured for adjustments.

3/1/2010:
• Added icons for footer screencast & FAQ items.
• Altered white for right side boxes to softer tone.
• Blanked out background on H4 items. (Right side sections with grey divider lines.)
• Adjusted H4 again to account for other page transparency.

3/2/2010:
• Updated body background color.
• Included affiliations & activity log sections in styles.
• Included capsule actions from new sections.
• Included quick add sections that were missed.
• Altered dashboard capsuleHeaders back to #eee.
• Subtle change of sidebar color to blue hue from lavender.
• Added "Deals" tab to coloring scheme.
• Correct "Advanced" search link to appear like other links in header navigation.

3/3/2010:
• Added notes for color selections to make additional related styles easier to manage.
• Updated font color for notes section to #333.
