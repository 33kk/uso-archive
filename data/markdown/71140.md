### Description
WIP - Let me know any changes/bugs in game/forums.

This is my maroon coloured FTP theme, so enjoy!

PS (Within the code I have robs skill bars and someone elses buttons, but I've closed them in comments for now. I am going to make my own, so they're placeholders so I don't forget. If you want, feel free to remove the comments.

Free FTP members may also want to scroll through, as the code has the ability to remove the club image/a couple of the PM links, but this is your choice, not mine!
