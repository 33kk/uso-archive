### Description
YouTube's new look does have advantages (eg. using avatars to make it easier to tell who wrote which comment at a glance) but it also has problems which, to me, drown out the advantages:

1. The all-white look is somewhat eye-searing
2. It's harder to quickly locate buttons such as like/dislike and show more/less.
3. It's distracting for so many things to change as your mouse moves over the larger region containing them.
4. The sticky header isn't worth the wasted space

This userstyle solves those problems while retaining as much of the new design aesthetic as feasibly possible by borrowing a few things from the older looks like background patterns and on-hover behaviours.

Thanks to http://userstyles.org/styles/77785/youtube-gray-background for the selectors needed for the main background color.

Ignore the missing video in the screenshot. It was too hard to get a sub-100KiB screenshot with it.
