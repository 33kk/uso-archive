### Description
When the new Last.fm site design came out in 2006 a number of people were disappointed that it didn't fit inside an 800x600 browser window. People who complained on the Last.fm forums were told this only affected 7%. This CSS patch works best when used in conjunction with the Greasemonkey Last.fm Small Screen Hack (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1887) by Decklin Foster.
