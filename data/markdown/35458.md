### Description
This is a work in progress that will eventually re-theme the not so popular game Carnage Blender to have a black and blue look.

The following are not yet completed
-------------------------------------

* Bullet Icons
* Headers and Subheaders in post fight log
* Homepage logo and image (not likely to happen)
* Logo in the sidebar
* Buttons

There are probably other things that I didn't mention as well.
