### Description
This is an example on how to write a Usercss style,
which can be used by both new Stylus and old, malicious Stylish.
The same code can be uploaded to both userstyles.org and openusercss.org or other.
Customization feature on userstyles.org web page will work as expected.

### Update notes
Inside the "Style Settings" section is a fake "Selection",
If a theme is downloaded from userstyles.org,
text in the "Selection" will be expanded to the CSS.

Variables customized by user on userstyles.org page will be translated into generic CSS variables.
When this same code is downloaded from elsewhere, the /*[[IF_userstyles.org]]*/ is not expanded and the "Translation" section is ignored. In that case, variables from @var are used.

Add any variable (Install Key) you use in Style Settings section into the Translation table in IF_userstyles.org
duplicate it in the second Choice of the Selection, for a case user would change the selection when customizing theme.
