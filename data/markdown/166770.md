### Description
What this stylesheet does
⭐ It changes column size (change percentages to best fit your screen size)
⭐ Media shows full thumbnail instead of a cropped piece 
⭐ Photoset Layout is stacked.
Bug: Gifs were cut in half but just re positioning didn't work so I increased top margin by 100% so gifs have quite ugly spacing. If you find a way to fix it please let me know.

Make sure your instance is included in the domain list or it won't work!
