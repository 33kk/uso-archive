### Description
In the beginning of September 2015, Tumblr made a major redesign that totally threw out the previous "nested blockquote" commenting presentation with a linear, forum-like commenting presentation. However, whoever designed the layout wasted a HUGE amount of vertical space causing "wastelands". This CSS tries to fix that stupidity.

### Update notes
In addition to the mentioned "vertical wasteland fix", many other tweaks were also performed, such as:

*) Better (more visible) separator between comments
*) Added comment will have a tinted background; no tinted backgroun means reblog without additional comments
*) Give additional gap between comment area and tag editing area, and make the separator between the two more visible.

Changelog: Available in the CSS itself, or you can look for the Commit messages at BitBucket.
