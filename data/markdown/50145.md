### Description
Removes Inline Frames, Tables, Ad-Bearing Divs and P-tags, and signatures that look like web bloat.
Removes Ads, Spam, and Unwanted Adult Content (esp stuff that is cross-linked)

For a good test, checkout http://www.btmon.com for a before+after (this has adult ads by the way so cover your kids/grandma's eyes first!) notice the 'after' page has no obscene material, this was my original goal as I do have two young children and hate having to shut off the monitor when unexpected ads show up on a webpage when I'm looking for my little pony episodes.. heh.
