### Description
Compresses the Status Bar.  Removes the padding that makes the statusbar larger on some themes.
This Style is mainly for Firefox 2, but it also works on Firefox 3 (You might not notice, though, because the default theme on Fx3 is already squished, but if you install another one, you will notice)

* Thanks user 3934 for style 3579

Increases editable screen size, allowing you to view and navigate more on websites


Browser Versions:
- Works on Firefox 2
- Works on Firefox 3 (Use large themes and see the difference.)

Integrates with Style 7908

About:Screenshots:
- On my Browser (Fx2) I saved myself 6 whole pixels of screen real-estate.  That is quite a lot.  

Changelog:
- Initial Release
