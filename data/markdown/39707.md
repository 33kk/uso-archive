### Description
Exactly what it says on the tin, a mod of style 33248 by user 55661. Font is changed from Gill Sans to Arial. Removes 4chan banners, and moot's messages, as well as changes the orientation from center to left in the image boards. Makes things less flashy overall: duration on color/opacity transitions no longer than .3s, no gradients in forms. Frontpage is virtually untouched from Mayhem's code, apart from fonts/transition speed.
Chrome/Chromium only.

U P D A T E: Regular reply is back like a heart attack.
