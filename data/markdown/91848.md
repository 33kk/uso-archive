### Description
This is an attempt to get back some of the old look for gmail specifically for the planets theme, including:
old-style compose (Note: you need to switch it to full-screen compose for this to work.)
old-style reply
old-style look

Does not fix the icons, but I find in smaller buttons they don't bother me as much.
