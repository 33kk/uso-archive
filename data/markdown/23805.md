### Description
The Horde webmail system is ugly, so I created this user stylesheet to make it somewhat bearable.  This isn't complete by any stretch, but it's a start.

** Note: Since horde is usually installed on your own server, you'll need to edit the url-prefix to match the domain your Horde is installed on.  (e.g. I replaced YOURDOMAIN.com with plasticmind.com) **
