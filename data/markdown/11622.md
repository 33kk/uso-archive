### Description
Did you like the old last.fm? With the narrow column on the left and wide column on the right?
And do you want to get it back? Then this is exactly for you.

IMPORTANT
This style is only enabled for http://www.last.fm/user/*, 

Right column is now on the left side and without the player. And is not so wide and I moved the profile info here

Left column is now on the right side and is wider than before.

I used menu from http://userstyles.org/styles/8892, so its same.

Library and Activity are no more visible. But if you want them back, then ask me ;)

There could be a little problem with the profile. It is possibility, that the text will get over "About Me" label, because height of the text can be different.

Picture is better than words. So look at the screenshots!
