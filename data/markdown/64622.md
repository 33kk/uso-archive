### Description
A slight modification to WorkFlowy.com to allow you to change your bullet colour, and tag colour for a bit of variety. 

By default the bullets are blue, and the tags are grey. I have also made them bold and smaller so that they are easier to read.

### Update notes
I took some parts from seanwcom's "Workflowy.com - Misc CSS Changes" - http://userstyles.org/styles/58901/workflowy-com-misc-css-changes, and some from "Monakai for Workflowy" by SOund, http://userstyles.org/styles/58654/monokai-for-workflowy and then edited them to suit my own needs and added the ability to choose the font/ bullet colours.

I hope this is ok! I'm not claiming that it is mine, so i guess it is. if not let me know. 

thanks.
