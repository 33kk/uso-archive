### Description
And I mean "inspired", not "ripped off"... ^_^;

Except for styling, it also contains two common tweaks - close button on single tab and marking unread tabs - in the beginning of the code.

Additionally, I got rid the dropdown menu to the right. To restore it, simply remove the "margin-right: -17px" from the TAB BAR ALIGNMENT section - I know, it was a quite lame way to get rid of anything. I couldn't be bothered to search.

Suggestions regarding the above, or creating gradients with CSS (so I can refrain from using pictures) are highly welcome.

Update 1:
* Removed the gloss from the tab bar itself (looks better with bookmarks tab enabled)
* Slightly rounded up the upper corners of an active tab

Update 2:
* Fixed the awful mistake with local paths to pictures...
