### Description
Add some color to deviantART's header bar with <b>HeaderCons</b>! It has always somewhat bothered me that <i>Messages</i> is the only menu item accompanied by an icon, so I decided to create a user style that adds icons to all of them! This not only makes the menu look a whole lot more eye-candy, but boosts its usability as well, as each item becomes more easily recognizable.
