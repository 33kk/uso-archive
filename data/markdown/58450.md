### Description
Removes the following context menu entries to provide a cleaner, more Chrome-like experience:

Stuff that's already got its own place elsewhere:
 - Stop
 - Bookmark Page
 - View Background Image
 - ...and some separators

Stuff that should really be optional and extension-provided:
 - Send Link...
 - Send Image...
 - Send Page...
 - Send Video...
 - Set Desktop Background

The more addon-added menu entries you have, the more you'll appreciate this.
