### Description
This style just lets you change the boring white and green to something more pleasing. You can make many different combinations to suit your style! You can also just leave it to a default style I made, but where's the fun in that?

### Update notes
v1.1: changed the custom header color to a drop down menu so it can be transparent 3/14/17
v1.0: released 3/13/17
I was inspired by https://userstyles.org/styles/120447/peaceful-ixl but it broke the IXL footer at the bottom and interfered with your tests. I made this so it would be more customizable and fix the footer issue.

If you have any suggestions or problems, just them down below!
