### Description
Dark theme for Atlassian JIRA. Developed against versions 7.3 through 7.6.

Check out the new style settings to change your link and header accent colors!

Works well with the <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/139939/jira-compact-sprint-board-and-backlog">Jira Compact Sprint Board and Backlog</a> style.

Written specifically against the traditional server installation of JIRA, not JIRA Cloud.
