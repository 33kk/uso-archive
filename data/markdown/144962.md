### Description
<p style="font-weight: bold;">
Like my other YouTube theme, but this one is for the new 2017 material design for YouTube. There is no need to activate the dark mode.
</p>

<p>
Videos should only be watched in the dark. May the dark be kinder on thine eyes. (YouTube dark theme)
</p>

<p>
This is a dark theme for YouTube inspired by  
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ft-deepdark/?src=search">FT DeepDark.</a>
</p>

<p>
Code also taken from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y8e4ae3q">youtube-custom-colors-video-progress-bar.</a> for the video theming.
</p>

<p>
Also, credit where credit is due for the color palettes. (<a href="https://github.com/KDE">@KDE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/horst3180">@horst3180</a>, <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint">@linuxmint</a>, YouTube and Discord)
