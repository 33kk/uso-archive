### Description
NOTICE!!!: This greasemonkey extension works sort of (if you refresh the page) but since it's so inconsistent i won't be using this. RIP- https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/39405-youtube-classic-for-2018-polymer-disable
This is a project just for fun :) solo because i'm using this to learn code

Tries to imitate YouTube in 2012. ***credits to naadir500 for inspiration, and their licensing to use their code***
