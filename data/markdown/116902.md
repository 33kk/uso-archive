### Description
The style for Yahoo! Answers in shades of green (from old format).
The colors are taken from WayBackMachine.
For example https://web.archive.org/web/20140205022519/http://answers.yahoo.com/

If you want round avatars then delete 12 lines (I write in "Notes" below) from the text of the style.

I'll change the style. Screenshots may differ from current style.
For old version delete lines below.

PS:
1. This style does not remove the advertisement.
I use Adblok Plus at the same time.

2. If you are using Adblock Plus, then the top of the page could be hidden when your are "log out".
But there is no problem with seeing of page in "log in".

3. I had practice on Y!A for a month.
Basically, I was interested in the rules and their application.
Please use my style. But I have to tell you that you shouldn't waste your time on Y!A and similar sites. 
There is no justice on these sites.
If you have any questions, please contact me akeyler@mail.ru.
