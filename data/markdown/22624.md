### Description
Have you wanted the first letter of emails you receive to be gigantic, stand out from the rest of the text, and be generally ridiculous and/or illegible?

Today's your lucky day.

This style tries to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_cap#Types_of_initials">Drop Cap</a> effect on your incoming email text bodies in Gmail. Works pretty well for non-html messages. It uses an elegant <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Rothenburg-Decorative">font courtesy of Alex Winterbottom</a>. 

Suggestions are welcome.
