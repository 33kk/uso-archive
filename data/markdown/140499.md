### Description
Let's you change the font that is displayed on tumblr. This userstyle only works on the dashboard, please let me know if something has been missed/is too big or small. The font you want to use must be installed on your computer for this userstyle to work.

### Update notes
4/15/2017 - I think I've gotten everything fixed up. Removed some code that was messing with the user popup header fonts. If that messed anything up please let me know.
