### Description
Changes the Pro-ROCK Forums colors (http://forums.pro-rock.info) to be black on white which is much more easy on the eyes.
You will also need My Image Here Firefox add-on and this file (http://loshia.com/misc/pro-rock-img.txt) to import in its options dialog (used to change some of the images with custom ones).
