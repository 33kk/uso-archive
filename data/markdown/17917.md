### Description
Fix for style 529 (by user 398) - specifically the top navigation links (they were light-grey text with white backgrounds), "Submit new links" buttons and a few other similar things.

Also hides the footer and subreddit bar - the CSS that does this is at the very end, and is clearly commented (if you wish to keep the subreddit bar or footer)
