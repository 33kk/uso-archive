### Description
This style is outdated and has been replaced: http://userstyles.org/styles/43235

This style shrinks the Addonbar to a smaller size and pushes it in one of the lower corners, like proposed in several mockups.

It although turns it 60% transparent, when nothing hovers above it. 

Tested on FF4.0b13pre 02.03.2011

Works with personas.
