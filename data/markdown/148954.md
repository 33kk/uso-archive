### Description
Since end of September 2017, row height was changed on Gmail mail list. It reduced number of rows to be seen. In my case it reduced to 18 from 25. I don't like it. So I create this stylesheet to be restore it.

P.S.
You can choose row height what you like on "Advanced Style Settings"
(Default row height is "Ignore Gmail Default")

### Update notes
