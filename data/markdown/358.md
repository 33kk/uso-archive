### Description
Google style for them darkish desktops.

Google's definetely too bright when viewed on my box (which has kinda *dark* desktop settings) - thank whatever Deity you'd like for Firefox and Stylish!

It also hides all the ads - if you want the "Sponsored links" section, there is a stanza in the code, labeled "comment this stanza out to have the sponsored links visible", just comment it out as suggested; thanks to user 386 for the suggestion.

This is *definetely* not complete; as for now, only the Google's main page, the search results, the Preferences, Advanced Search and Language Options are (almost) complete, and "search in results"  has the logo not changed yet in the english version (it works OK on google.pl, though).

And yes, the code is quite some mess, it was coded during 2 nights (and then some) and needs some serious clean-up.

I will try to add the missing google pages to it, too, but that's gonna take some time.

Thanks go to user 12 for style 76, that inspired this one (and gave some good hints, too).

Enjoy!

***UPDATE***
I've mangled a bit and made the style darken the wikipedia pages, inserted into the search result pages by the Googlepedia firefox extension, so they don't "stand-out" from the dark Google results.
I also added a nice comment to indicate, which stanza needs to be commented-out in order to actually show the ads/sponsored links.
There have also been some minor bugfixes.

So-called "features":
 - a nice, dark Google outfit;
 - ...with logo's and pictures changed to fit it, too;
 - no adds (the ad elements have "visibility:hidden" set) - read above on how to have the ads shown;
 - the theme takes care of darkening the wikipedia pages, inserted next to the search results by the Googlepedia Firefox extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2517/), so they fit nicely into the dark Google and dark desktops.

***UPDATE 2***
the style has been updated due to recent changes in the google website; support of the excellent GooglePedia extension has also been improved.

please do post information on any bugs etc. either here, or send to mikiwoz[ at ]yahoo[ dot ]co[ dot ]uk

Enjoy!
