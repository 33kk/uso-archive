### Description
This Style hides all potential spoilers and distractions from YouTube. Great for watching e-sports. Not so great for finding out how long a video is.

### Update notes
<b>Things this style hides:</b>
<ul><li>Current/Total time from thumbnails/video player/progress bar</li>
<li>Likes/Dislikes</li>
<li>Comment section</li>
<li>"Related" video section</li>
<li>Playlist of player page</li>
<li>Upload date of videos</li>
<li>View Count</li>
<li>Subscription count on player and channel page</li></ul>

<b>Customization</b> options are now available when installing or updating. That said, I also put effort into making the CSS as readable for inexperienced users as I could, to make editing this style as easy as possible.

The <b>views, likes, dislikes and subscribers</b> are classified as "metadata" by YouTube and it is significantly easier to hide all of them than to hide them separately. For the same reason the button texts for the share and save buttons is hidden as well when activating that option (although the buttons are still there and fully functional because they are a separate issue. Apparently.)
I will, get around to sorting this out at some point. Eventually. Maybe. Poke me if this bothers you.

<b>Known issues:</b>
<ul>
<li>* <strike>This style apparently hides the "Sign in" button on YouTube's front page as well. Oops.</strike> Should be fixed now.</li>
<li>* The player might not be properly centered on screens with a resolution below 1080p or above 4K if both playlist and "related" section are hidden. There is now a customization option to not center the player at all to avoid problems.</li>
<li>* The little dot next to view count that separates view count from upload date does not hide together with the upload date if the view count is displayed. Nothing I can do about that unfortunately. It's part of the view counter for whatever reason.</li>
<li>* Hiding views/likes/dislikes/subscribers also hides the button text of the share and save buttons. Don't worry though, the buttons themselves are still there. See above.</li>
</ul>
