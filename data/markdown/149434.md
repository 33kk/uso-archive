### Description
Adds custom tags to users on the Wanikani forums.

Enter the username (case sensitive), the tag you want to give them, and the colour you want the tag, in the options. Allows for up to 20 tags by default but it's easy to add more yourself.

### Update notes
If you update the style you will have to set the usernames and tags again, since they revert to default otherwise, so I recommend just editing the script.
