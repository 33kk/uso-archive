### Description
You know how RTM looks like.. Well, the typefolk rioted screaming something about table borders, size, priority, and better font stacks. Things align now, magical right? The cow logo is gone, I might make that an option later, but currently makes space for a better status popup.

Top navmenu that appears faded on the screenie transitions to full opacity on hover.
