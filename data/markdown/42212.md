### Description
Enjoy the plain text commentary for Cricket a little more for when you can't be watching it.

Highlights:
* Color coded action 
* Simplified scorecard 
* Readable typography
* Now updated to work with warm up matches


Built on top of style 19121 by user 25411 which went some way in removing ads, this script removes a few more ads and sponsored content and also has some adjustments for the new layout.

There is also a Greasemonkey script that adds some extra touches, and can work alongside this style. You can get it at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/94073
