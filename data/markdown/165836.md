Essential usability fixes to make it possible to use YouTube in 2019:
- Make thumbnails less prominent so they won't take away your attention and it'll be less likely to click on a clickbait video

- Highlight channel name and make it bigger

- Make video title less prominent and make it smaller

- Hide verified account badge on subscription grid

- Bring back good old subscribe button a la 2010

- A fresh new logo that more accurately than the official logo represents YouTube's attitude towards the viewers and good content creators (<b>Currently doesn't work very well, please PM me if you know how to fix this</b>)
