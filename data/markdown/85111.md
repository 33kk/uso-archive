### Description
A clean theme based on some Twitter Bootstrap styles.
Allows to choose between either dark or light theme.

### Update notes
Most of the site should be themed properly. Please report if you find any ugly pages.

It has been tested mainly as Chrome, as that is my main browser, but it should work fine in Firefox with some minor quirks.
