### Description
Stylish theme for Firefox.
Wikipedia rebuild using many CSS3 techniques like box shadow, text shadow, multiple backgrounds, rounded corners...
Its beautiful in a minimal, clean way. 

Linen background for book reading like experience.
Article like paper in front.
Navigation panels with 3d shading effects.
Search field that integrates seamless into suggestions field and contrasts to the rest of the page.
No Tabs for "article, discussion...". Glowing indicators instead.

Links dont disturb reading flow. They only appear if you hover the paragraph.
Link hover with Text shadow instead of simply changing color.

Pictures have box shadows to contrast from page (like a picture sticking on the page). Caption not inside picture frame.
Many rounded corners for box elements. For me this feels more natural. 
Floating references inspired from style 15355 by user 15180, restyled.

First version. Suggestions welcomed!
