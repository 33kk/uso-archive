### Description
Based on the grate job that PhiloHippus did in its Google Tahoma (unified font style) <http://userstyles.org/style/show/178> I created this addition to support the video.google.com domain.

ATTENTION: This style is an addition to PhiloHippus's Google Tahoma (unified font style) <http://userstyles.org/style/show/178>. They must be both installed or incorporated into one style.

@PhiloHippus, if you are reading this then you are more then welcome to go head and incorporate this style into your Google Tahoma (unified font style). They should go together.
