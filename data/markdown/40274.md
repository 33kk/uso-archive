### Description
This style modifies the Firefox Menu Button from a text version into a Button version with an icon.
There is a newer version with an orange icon http://userstyles.org/styles/40165, therefore this version is the last with a violet icon and won't be updated anymore. 

ver.0.2.1

Based on:
-"Firefox 4 - Move Tabs into Title Bar (Win XP)" by lOtR. http://userstyles.org/styles/36044
-"Maximized Appmenu Button As Tab" by foxxyn8. http://userstyles.org/styles/39724

This style is tested on Firefox 4.0b7 and 4.0b8pre.

Changes in 0.2.1:
-min-height of button has been decreased to 18px, so it fits into the titlebar of the Win2000 skin. If you liked the overlapping effect, feel free to change in back to 22px.

Changes in 0.2:
-minor graphical fixes in glow effect of the Firefox Menu Button
-changed #appmenu-button-container position from fixed to relative. This comes at cost of less
control about the FFButton position, but also places it at the right positions at the edge of
the window.
