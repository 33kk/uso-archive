### Description
A theme that uses transparencies, a lot of blue and a wood texture for background.

Should look good on most resolutions. 

NOTICE - Both of the screen shots are after the style is applied. The reason for this is that userstyles.org keeps 
giving me Apache errors if I try to upload any other way.

Tested in Chrome and Firefox.

4chan x is supported.
