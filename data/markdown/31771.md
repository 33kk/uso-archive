### Description
This is a TEMPLATE, and needs to be edited on your own to work.
It began as an experiment to find out how many selectors in KoL* I could target.

The colors are all different because they are NOT SUPPOSED TO MATCH. Each color targets a different selector type, mostly to demonstrate how to select certain elements.

I want people to create their own color schemes with it, and then save a copy with their own name. 

Take any or all of this code for yourself to learn from, without crediting me. 
-But- if you create a new KoL style based on this code, I would appreciate a link-back (use "style 31771" in the Long description box) and maybe a discussion comment on this page. :)
