### Description
Join the Neopets Matrix...where you can have all the dream pets you want...by editing a tiny bit of CSS.

This theme is a collection of image replacements for pet images across the community. Many users will change converteds into UCs, some people will use custom art for their pet, edit a neopet's colors, or even use an image of Lady Gaga for their pet. The possibilities are endless. I will update this theme as I add more user's codes to it. Users will need to click "Update" themselves to update to new versions. I will check codes individually and will not allow the image replacement of items, only pets! 

Install the theme, go into the edit CSS section and you will find all of the detailed instructions. 

*UPDATE: this plugin is only for personal use now. i will not be adding any pets to the shared matrix file until it is cleared by TNT. i will send an editorial question to clear it up. until then, enjoy using for yourself only. :)
