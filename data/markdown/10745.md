### Description
Using Dana's most recent style as a base, I made the following changes, intended to simplify things and have it almost perfect for review with tech:

• Normalized h3.breaking so it does not become too big

• Adjusted line-height on h3.sectionHeader

• Made subsection heads turn orange on hover

• Removed lines from ads since it created some problems and wasn't specifically typography related

• Made the 4px dotted changes apply to everything *except* blogs

• Removed spacing above from section links in the classified widget 

• h2s are 24px (please check that this is ok in on PCs, I suspect it's all right)
