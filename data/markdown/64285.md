### Description
This little style adds pony faces to your post on 4chan, after putting a pony's name in the email field.
It's based on the emojoi pictures from the Oneechan userstyle, but adds more than just the main six. A large number of secondary and background characters are supported, and more will be added with each update.
See below for a list of supported ponies.

!UPDATED JUNE 29th FOR 4CHAN OVERHAUL, FINALLY!
Sorry for the hiatus. I'll be implementing the new faces and positioning option soon.
