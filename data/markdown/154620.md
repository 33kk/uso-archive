### Description
Better heroku log for smaller screens.
This hides the entire UI of the Heroku website, leaving only the logs taking the whole viewport, essentialy breaking the website. Unless, of course, all you need is the logs.

It's recommended for people who use the logs for long periods and have small screens.
Also, if you fit the description above, it's very likely that you might want to pin the tab.
