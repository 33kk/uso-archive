### Description
Removes the annoying elements around the search bar in Gamespot 2.0, such as count downs and ads, as of November 2008.

I don't feel like maintaining this too much, so if you want to do some fancy CSS with this, you don't need to ask. I only require that you give credit to me at either the top or bottom of your CSS and discription.
