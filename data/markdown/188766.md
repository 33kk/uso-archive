### Description
Today, September 2nd, the official Michaels Craft Store chat had gone down,  and replaced with "toky.chat"
Us Michaelheads community are disapproving of this. I wrote a userstyle in a couple of hours that replaces the toky.chat UI with the original Michaels one as accurately as I could
