### Description
Render Google News easier to read and scan by reducing some page clutter and restyling some elements.

Have an idea to improve this style sheet? Let me know.
Comments and suggestions are always appreciated. 

*** Update -- September 10, 2009 ***

Three cosmetic tweaks.
  
1) New Style: a.gb2:hover {background-color: #ebeff9 !important; }
This style affects the *more* drop-down menu links located at top of page, rendering the links easier to read on hover.

2) Change style: Changed color of news story titles (h2.title a and div.title a) from #314e83 to #003399 to increase contrast slightly.

3) Change style: Changed link hover color for generic links and news story title links (h2.title a:hover and div.title a:hover) from #aa2f54 to #990000 to increase contrast slightly

Note: All changed original styles remain in code but have been commented out.  

*** Update -- September 15, 2009 ***

Extended styles to support google.com/finance/market_news

Late addition: Slight increase of font size and line height for headlines and story text.
