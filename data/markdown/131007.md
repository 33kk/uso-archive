### Description
Early beta of furvilla overhaul.
A lot of useless stuff removed, redesigned parts of the UI for easy access to features.

Currently under heavy development.

WARNING, if you use it together with my 'FVToolkit-Sidebar' script, you have to manually disable some widgets in order to avoid conflicts.

uncomment lines 3-7 of the style (delete '/*' and '*/' )
