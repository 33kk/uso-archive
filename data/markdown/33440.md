### Description
PLEASE RATE OR LEAVE A COMMENT AFTER TRYING, 

This aero theme for Firefox 4.0+ maximizes the screen space by moving the tabs to the top of the Firefox browser, placing them in between the new Firefox button and the min, max, and close buttons.  The default coloring is a glassed orange made to match the default Firefox 4.0 button color. There are a bunch of other colors to choose from within the code (simple as copy and paste), and if you have new variations for color gradients please post them and I will add them.

This style has been tested to work in Win 7 Ultimate 32bit and 64 bit.
[There are issues with firefox 4.0b5 things have been changed in the browser and elements do not appear correctly]

If you have any feature requests, suggestions, or issues please leave a comment. This Style is still in development, and changes will occur as the Firefox browser reaches the stable 4.0


OPTIONS
*Accent color can be customized (I personally use the blue gradient)
*StumbleUpon hack - follow the about:config instructions found in the code to activate. to remove, comment out where indicated in the code and in the about:config console enter "stumble.right-justify-width" and change the value to "?(to be added when i find it)"
