### Description
Wikipedia - cites fainter and without brackets.

This style removed the brackets from Wikipedia's inline citations and makes the remaining numbers fainter. Adapted from "Wikipedia - fainter inline cites" derived from code by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mzajac. It works on the English, German and French wikipedia domains.

This style sheet modifies the appearance of Wikipedia articles such that inline reference cites will appear without brackets (so "[23]" will appear as just "23"), but they will become highlighted in yellow when you move the mouse over the paragraph that contains them. This is intended to first make them inconspicuous, but also reasonably easy to find when you want to.

Limitations:
* brackets remain in cites inside wikipedia table cells (because those have no span elements)
