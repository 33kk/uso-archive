### Description
Fades or completely hides the less important "Like" and "also commented on" notifications that clutter your Facebook Notifications dropdown list, so you can focus on the ones that matter:  1) comments on YOUR posts; 2) replies to YOUR comments on other people's posts; and 3) comments from the AUTHORS of other posts you have commented on.

The default settings FADE the less important notifications (see main screenshot). To hide them completely (screenshot #2) remove the entire line containing the word "default" for each type of notification you want to hide. 

Fully annotated with instructions.
