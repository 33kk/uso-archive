### Description
A simple bright version for the Official US Playstation blog. For those that have difficulty reading text on dark backgrounds.

Ooh look, PS.Blog has seen the light and went bright! http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/08/hey-why-is-the-playstation-blog-white/
So this style is mostly not needed anymore, I'll probably make another one soon which will only change the horrible 100% red comments and adds a light grey-ish background on text blocks as those are 100% white now.


Also check my other styles for other Playstation blogs, as they're all using dark backgrounds...
- style 8342
- style 8343
