### Description
Don't like the colors of AppChan or just wanna take a shot at doing your own? This userstyle serves to take the color portions of style 54149 and simply move them out of the layout and position elements to allow easier customization to fit your needs.

Currently only the original AppChan color scheme, Midnight Caek, and Muted are supported. More options will become available as I rewrite them with better commenting.

If you feel comfortable trying to make your own color scheme from scratch for AppChan without having a base, without having to edit CSS, or simply using the "Tomorrow" scheme as a base, style 55308 provides a simple interface which should be compatible with AppChan unless user 98506 decides to deviate style 56312 in a direction different than AppChan. With the preceding warning in mind, this style should also be compatible with OneeChan.

### Update notes
More options will become available as I write them in.

As with AppChan, color scheme previews can be found here: https://github.com/zixaphir/AppChan/wiki/Color-Schemes

Eventually all shown color schemes will be ported here.
