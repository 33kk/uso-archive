### Description
Moves the Wikipedia TOC to the right as well keep it there where ever you scroll the page. Obviously it works better with a style that keeps the right side empty such as style 13255, but will work for unstyled Wikipedia too - just that you might want to hide the TOC more often than not.

There is one bug - if the TOC is longer height of the visible browser area, then the bottom of the TOC is unceremoniously cut off. As usual, I do not see a fix for this, but do drop a line below in the forum if you think there is.

Technical information - #globalWrapper is added to every ruleset such that when used in conjunction with another style interference is not caused by rulesets with the same specificity.
