### Description
Another fork of  https://github.com/oskarkrawczyk/hackernews-userstyles. I mostly changed link colors. Specifically:

- Visited links are now distinguishable from new links
- The "(45 comments)" links in the subtitle are no grayed out (those are the most important links for me)
- The links in the header are de-emphasized
- The vote buttons were mis-aligned. I opted to restore the original appearance without the gaudy orange background.
