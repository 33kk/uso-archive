### Description
Will replace the "Star" icon for favourites in Mastodon with a "heart" ❤ (yes I know, a lot of you guys prefer the star, but then again, you don't HAVE to install this userstyle ...) 
Mastodon.social is supported out of the box, for other servers just add your domain to the script (where it says "addyourdomain.here").
