### Description
Changed the font, font size, and margin/padding for some of the FriendFeed entry, comment, etc. divs to make viewing FF a little more compact.  Also made the left navbar a bit narrower, and also added soft dotted lines between main entry divs, and made all entry/comment divs use the whole width of the page.

This helps compact things a bit and make it easier to get through more feeds & comments faster.
