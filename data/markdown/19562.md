### Description
Inspired by makondo & SirCam.
Tried to make it look more native

Tested on Win7/FF3.5(ru), does not require Glasser

Integrates with this styles http://userstyles.org/users/12489

I tried to add transparent background image like in style 19561 but it made the style too long to post it here =(
