### Description
You know, making no sales from your books for the day is hard enough. Adding insult to injury is looking at that ugly brown/beige/whatever-it-is colour when you're down in the dumps. Don't kick a man when he's down, right? So here's a quick fix of a funny cat gif to make the sting of lack of sales a little easier to bear.
