### Description
Finally fixed this dumb style for new youtube, lol.

'lol you use !important' shut the fuck up
<br />
Note: This only changes the logo, nothing else is changed. Though, some other stuffed will be changed too, soon. Also, this only effects the old YouTube, not the new one. So anyone using the new youtube can't use this style. 

To use the style, click your channel icon on the top right, click "Restore old YouTube", enter the reason for why you are leaving, and then you can use the style. If you want to return the New YouTube, go to youtube.com/new to restore the New YouTube

Now where's my food? Oh wait
