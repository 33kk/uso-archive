### Description
Essentially this does the same thing as my other style sheet here: http://userstyles.org/styles/2084

Except in this style, the cursor (or mouse pointer) changes to an icon which represents the type of link it is over, transforming with each specific link and going back to normal when moving away from links. It's helpful for identifying what a link is bringing you to before you click on it. Works on most browsers.

P.S. If you are using the GreaseKit add-on for Safari, you may load this as a user script. If wrapped in script, most CSS styles (including this one) are fully compatible with GreaseKit.
