### Description
A little style to edit the plain Gaia Navigation Bar (Home, My Gaia, World, etc.). Editing the code is fine with me, just be sure to know what you're doing.

-- Sorry, this doesn't work after Gaia updated their Navigation bar, if anyone would like to fix/mend this code to have it work again, be my guest. :)
