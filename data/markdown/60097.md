### Description
Transforms the current version of the Google Docs writer into a minimalistic, dark screen to assist with creating a distraction-free writing environment. Makes the screen dark, inverts colours, and hides all the editor chrome. You can bring it all back up temporarily by just hovering your mouse near the top of the screen. Be sure to run with the browser in full-screen mode (F11 on Windows, Command+Shift+F on OS X)
