### Description
This removes button images and the background from dTa's download manager's toolbar, minimizes the surrounding space, and gives each button an outset-on-hover and inset-on-active effect.

Optional effects, commented out by default:
- reduce the toolbar's font size (which makes it even less thick)
- hide the "Help!" link in dTa's download manager's status bar

Updated (20090201): help link gone: removed code to hide it; donate button moved and makes the toolbar very wide: hide it again
Updated (20080608): works with current layout
