### Description
After Wikipedia Tribute (http://userstyles.org/styles/58965/wikipedia-tribute), OpenStreetMap Tribute is my second contribution to polish some of the important crowd sourced portals on the web.
The design goals were the same as with Wikipedia Tribute: 
- reducing visual overhead
- maximizing screen space
- "App-lified" user experience

The theme is not yet finished but ready to be used. It fits perfectly to Wikipedia Tribute ("Understatement" overlay)
(http://userstyles.org/styles/58965/wikipedia-tribute)

Enjoy,

PS: You will notice some stylesheet errors when applying the style. Don't mind, they can be ignored.
