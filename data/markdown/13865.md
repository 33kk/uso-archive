### Description
This Style relies on style 9597 for making the basic removal of unwanted columns and Ads, ao it does not provide any means for removing those.

It adds a general cleanup of the Telepolis UI by removing all unnecessary Sidecolums and improving on Text contrast and -size.
Both normal entries, as well as the "TP Blogs" are covered, so a consistent interface is provided.

[Update 20090809] Adapted to new Style changes in style 9597: Now also shows the comments in the "TP Blogs" Section again and has the background back to white.
