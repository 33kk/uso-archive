### Description
A limited substitute for the extension Séparé [ can be found here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1945/ ]
Allows you to use blank tabs as separators between groups of adjacent tabs.

LAST UPDATE:  Made blanks tabs look like separators in the 'List all tabs' menu

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

 * Borrowed code to colour the tabs from user 12's style 1179
 * Also thanks to user 99 for the code to hide the tab icon & text and to reduce the tab width.
