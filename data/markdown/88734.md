### Description
View flickr photostreams and 'explore' pages etc. as a single, centered, vertical column on a light-grey background, rather than the full-page, justified view imposed by the 20/5 flickr 'update'.

This style can be used in combination with my 'simplr flickr', for a cleaner, less cluttered viewing experience.

Note that this style is unsuitable for viewing group pools.
