### Description
This is a style for Trello. It makes the Boards Drawer (the sidebar) slimmer and more stylish. It's especially useful when setting the Board Drawer to always stay open. This style is based on Trello Mamselle by dasproduktiv but <em>only</em> styles the Boards Drawer, leaving the main area background customizable.
