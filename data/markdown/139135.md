### Description
This removes a lot of duplicate and unnecessary UI elements, which makes for a much more minimal forum browsing experience. Nearly every piece of code has a comment above it to describe what it does.

All of this code has either been provided by "wiiija", "mortals" or "fairly sure the answer is no" on ocuk forums.
