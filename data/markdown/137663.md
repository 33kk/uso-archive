### Description
A stylish that changes the orange bits of Kitsu into other colors.

The default makes things pink, you can go into the code and change the number in the "filter:" thingy to make it do other colors(1-360 will have some effect, I can't tell you which'll do what however). Not my fault if you break it though.

I make this while using Turnip's "Turnip's Terrible theme" so things that might seem odd without it will most likely not be fixed. Here's a link to that, if you don't already have it. https://tinyurl.com/TurnipsTerribleTheme
