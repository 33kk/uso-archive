### Description
Since Firefox 3.5 Font rendering style http://userstyles.org/styles/20442 at userstyles.org got so huge success, I thought of refining the code of rendering in Firefox 3.6.9 and above...

I still wonder why we don't have this type of font rendering by default in our firefox...

Anyway I hope you will keep liking it....
I have kept the code as small as possible....Any suggestion is welcome....If anything important you find regarding the style then mail me at admin@logonaniket.com

**SCREENSHOT MAY NOT DEFINE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS STYLESHEET...JUST USE THIS ONCE...I AM SURE U WILL LIKE IT AND FALL IN LOVE WITH FIREFOX AGAIN :)

Cya :)
