### Description
You a Minecraft Modpack Developper and you are tired of bright background website? CraftTweaker is an amazing mod, and the documentation is awesome, but the website is all white and light-gray, this hurt my eyes all the time...

I finally decide to make a Dark-Theme for the website, question more comfortable for my and your eyes!!
