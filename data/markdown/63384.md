### Description
On March 31, 2012, YouTube added a light switch on all video pages for Earth Hour. When clicked, the switch made the page turn dark as shown in the screenshot. After the 31st, the switch will probably be removed, and so will the dark style of YouTube. I have extracted the images and CSS from the dark YouTube and put them in this style. This style will allow you to enable YouTube with the "lights out" even after Earth Hour has ended, and the style is applied all throughout the site.

All of the code and images come from YouTube. All I have done is made them compatible to work in Stylish.

Enjoy.
