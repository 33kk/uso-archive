### Description
(Updated for new Salon design, around October 2010)

I like reading Salon but the web design is awful -- I like to use the mobile version but it is not optimized for a regular browser.  This seems to be make it look good, at least on the Windows Vista machine I have at work; I use mobile.salon.com instead of the main site.
