### Description
(This Style is for Classic Twitch) This style changes the way the Twitch.tv channel pages and directory are displayed. It makes the flash player larger and will make the chat larger and wider, with slightly bigger font size. This Style also removes all the ad boxes around site, but it does not affect the Ads that are played by the broadcasters. If you want to support a broadcaster, this style will not interfere with that as long you make sure to leave Ad-Block turned off. This Style also reverts the Channel Directory back to the old format, with smaller preview boxes and more channels being displayed horizontally.

### Update notes
No support for Night Themes or Dark Themes. There are other Styles that do that quite well already, please try those. Simply enable this Style after the dark Style to reduce code overlapping. 

I recommend you leave Ad-Block turned off to support the Broadcasters around the site. The Style already takes care of most of the Ad boxes around the site, but still allows the Ads played in the flash player that support the Broadcasters.

*Added Extra Large Player size option. Only recommended for larger than 1080p monitors, and/or full screen browser mode, because it does take a large chunk of screen real-state. Alternatively you can try the default Large Player Style and zoom in with your browser's built in zoom function.
