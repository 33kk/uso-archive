1. Slims navigation bar
2. Adds gradient to url bar
3. Restyles drop down menus (including url bar drop down)
4. Restyles Firefox application button
5. Makes a few of the default toolbar buttons more colorful
6. Slims and sharpens tab bar
7. Removes "list all tabs" and "group tabs" buttons
8. Autohides status/add-on bar (hover over bottom right-hand corner of Firefox window to make it appear)

If you don't like one of these features, simply delete it from the style's code under the relevant heading.
