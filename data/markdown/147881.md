### Description
This small style removes the interface on Google Maps, which can help you get good pictures of the virtual version of our world. To hide pins and roads, disable this style, open the menu on the left side and select "labels on", which will disable them. Afterwards, you can re-enable this style to see Google Maps with no distractions.
