### Description
A userstyle with minimal hardcore changes to the Wikia Site, only removing stuff I and many others would consider clutter, junk, crap... You get the idea.

I found that trying to use Wikia recently has felt like a massive chore and that's a clear cut problem, because it houses a lot of valuable information about all sorts of niche subjects.

The focus of this style is to make each Wiki more about the actual wiki you are on, and less about Wikia's recent change of direction toward "Fandom".
