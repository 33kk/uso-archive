### Description
This 'userstyle' will Awesome-ize the way you view your notes on deviantart!!! 
the 'notes' section has always seemed a bit dull, 
but this script will put an end to that. 

of-course in order for it to work you will need to be logged into deviantart.com

(this 'userstyle' has been made with 'Stylish' on 'Firefox', for 'Stylish' on 'Firefox'.) 
[there are a few 'bugs' with un-read messages in group messages, nothing too serous.]
