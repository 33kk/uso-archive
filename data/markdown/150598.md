### Description
Update: you can now change the theme natively in your Weekdone settings at https://weekdone.com/profile. Choose between Light (default), Dark and automatic Dark from sunset until sunrise 

Dark theme turns the light surfaces of the page dark, creating an experience ideal for night. 
Easy on the eyes for those late evenings in the office and night owls checking up on their team.
