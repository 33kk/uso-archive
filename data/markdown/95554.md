### Description
Add nice Mac OS X scrollbars to your Firefox. It's lightweight and good-looking, in my opinion much better than the Windows scrollbar - especially in Windows 8.
I've created it because the current solutions don't work or have strange bugs and/or are not updated since long time...

Tested with Firefox 25 in Windows 8.1 x64.
If you notice any display error, let me know it, please!
