### Description
This is just a little fix for people experiencing the same problem I had on multiple machines running Firefox 3 on KDE3 with TabMixPlus, having multiple tab rows: If the active tab was not in the last row, it got a real strange look (see "before" screenshot). I searched for days until I found this very easy work-around...
