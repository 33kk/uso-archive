### Description
I literally could not figure out how to get a style added to Writing.Exchange on Mastodon so instead of feeling sick to my stomach on the default I just took the code for Clean Mastodon by Sara Rosa (https://userstyles.org/styles/144328/clean-mastodon) and added the Writing.Exchange to it. I don't even know if it will work because I don't know what I'm doing.
