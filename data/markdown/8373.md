### Description
Blueish style, with a fixed no-repeat background image from Xenoglossia (or so I think). 
It also uses some transparent  PNG images so that the background image is visible all the time, but the transparency is never more than 80%, that means it's not much intrusive with the main content of the website. 

Also: It hides the top links on each board because I use only the left frame to navigate the website, never used the top links too much. Ads are not hidden. 

BE SURE TO CHECK THE OTHER STYLE, FOR THE NAVIGATION FRAME:

ALSO BE AWARE THIS IS FOR img.420chan.org/* YOU'LL HAVE TO ADD OTHER SUBDOMAINS SUCH AS disc.420chan.org ETC
