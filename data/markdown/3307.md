### Description
MySpace Home Cleanz0rz is an effective way to clean up your mySpace Home. It is very easely customizable, as you will see in the code. Also, it does a neat little thing to the InfoBox (that thingwith your profile views in it). I created this userstyle because I wasn't happy with any of the other MySpace Home ones available. I guess no one will ever be happy with any preset for his or her MySpace Home, that's why I made sure this one is easely editable.

Oh, and for the heck of it, check out my profile!

[Update #1]
Added more switchable sections.
MySpace Tom's announcements should now be showed by default
Hide "powered by Google"

[Update #2]
Added a switch for the Profile Options (Classic/New).
Rehid "powered by Google" and the search bar.
Resized the big blue header so it looks better.
> @EdenResident, I couldn't find the "Your Network" box you are mentioning, could you please provide a screenshot? I'll be glad to get rid of it for you :)

[Update #3]
Hid Friend Updates by default. You can display them again by uncommenting the correct line of code as described.
> @yestergray, I can't find that box, maybe MySpace has removed it by now :)
