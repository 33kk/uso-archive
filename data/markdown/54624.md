### Description
This style strips down *EVERYTHING* but the video itself & video list.
The video list is invisible (until hovered with mouse) and resides on the right edge of the screen.



TL;DR: all black, nothing extra, videolist shows when you move mouse to the right.

### Update notes
To speed up page loads, use adblock (or similar) to block all .js files on the site, they're fairly useless with this style.

Oct.5th: 
  1. added nifty css3 animation to videolist show/hide.
  2. second update! reworked the animation to *hopefully* work on all non-retarded browsers
  3. made it a bit nicer.
