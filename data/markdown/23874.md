### Description
Takes the existing TeuxDeux layout and widens it and shortens it.

Almost half of the lines in the standard interface go to waste with my paltry 4-6 items per day, and the height made it difficult to view on my short laptop resolution. Aside from that, I found that the standard column width left room for very few characters before automatically truncating the item, so I wanted wider columns to fill up a 1024-wide browser.

There is one issue I havenâ€™t quite cracked yet. While I've successfully widened the list columns, on reload the items are still shortened based on the older parameters. I am guessing this happens somewhere in the JavaScript that I can't modify. Once I hover over the ellipsis, the full item (providing that it's only one line, still) will show and remain showing until the page is refreshed.

UPDATE, 2010-02-01: Thanks to krewetka for improving the display of longer items!
