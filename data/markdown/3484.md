### Description
For use with the IJ Skins: Class Adder [ http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11289 ] Greasemonkey script - it won't work without it. Find Greasemonkey here [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 ].

Made for the Hand scheme, but will also work with Honeycomb, Honeycomb Redesigned and Brown. Adapted from [http://userstyles.org/styles/3152] by furiosity.

[Edit Sept. 25, 07] I've noticed that if you use LJlogin's new version, which allows use on IJ, and you use it to regulate your browsing preferences (Hand, Tweak, etc.) strange things happen to the font size in the sidebar.  If this happens to you, just up the font size on these codes from 8px to 10px:

.sitescheme td.head {
        color: #000000 !important;
        border-bottom: solid 1px #000000 !important;
        background-color: #ffffff !important;
        font: 8px Verdana, Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif !important;
  } 

table.nav {
        font-size: 8px !important;
        color: #000000 !important;
}
