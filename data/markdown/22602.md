### Description
I made this style because my brain hurts from watching those bright letters on a dark background on scenereleases.  So I searched for firefox plugins that made me change a website css file and I found stylish. Perfect. One hour later and I made a new style, borrowing some css code from the guy who made the "SceneReleases.info Dark-N-Grey" style. I also had some inspiration from rlslog.

I'm no css expert but know enough to get the job done. Tested only in firefox and it works for me.
