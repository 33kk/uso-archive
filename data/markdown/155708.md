### Description
I have fixed some the issues I had with the Default Style for Brawl vault. Example include:

* Larger Text, Larger Links, The Hack list extends naturally down the page, no more scrolling with a tiny window, About box now stretches accross the screen; no more tiny box with hard to read font, Colors minimized to just grey for easier on eyes presentation, Rounded Borders,  Rounded Pictures, Auto Stretching to page width. Its no longer crunched to half the screen size.
