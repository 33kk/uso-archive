### Description
Makes changes to the NewsFox interface. Sticks toolbar buttons to the left for easier access as well as editing the toolbars for aesthetics and usability.

Change log:
3.29.08: Initial release.
3.30.08: Added padding around toolbars.
4.11.08: Changed site rule to domain instead of specific URL since I just found out that Newsfox utilizes different URLs sometimes.
4.14.08: Fixed site rule once again.
8.8.08: Removed the border at the top of the toolbar beside the feed heading.

Comments and feedback are highly encouraged.
