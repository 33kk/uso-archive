### Description
I am not sure wtf happened, but some of the words were going off to the right.  I just resized the p width.  Easy peasy lemon squeezey.  The problem may've been related to the sidebar remover.

It also ditches that lame "consumer guide" section and moves the "next" div a bit to the left for better click access.
