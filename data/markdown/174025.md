### Description
<b>A simple dark theme for writing.com.</b> Besides changing the text and background color to night tones it also inverts the colors of all png and gif images and reduces their saturation (many of the original icons has white artifacts around them that looks ugly on a dark background, so the filters are a must). You can hide or show the upper banner in the customization button.

v1.0 - Final version.

### Update notes
v0.1 It looks ok... isn't it?
v0.2 The popup menus were broken, I changed the selectors to fix it.
v0.3 Making some transparent images and DIV remain transparent. I also made the image filtering optional.
v0.4 I simplified the selectors. Added an exception to the inversion for a dark GIF
v0.5 I replaced a <b>*</b> for 10 specific selectors so it would be a little faster. I hope that optimization doesn't break things. Added more transparent exceptions and text and background color customization. Probably the final version.
v1.0 Added an optional rule to show the upper banner.
v1.1 Transparency fix.
v1.2 Fixed non-transparent floating image over the search bar. Inverted images are now a bit darker.
v1.3 The dots from interactive stories are now lightgray
v1.4 Darker colors for read emails. A fix for users of find+ extension
