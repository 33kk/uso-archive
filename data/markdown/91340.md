### Description
This CSS configuration is a dark version of the canvas content management system used by many school systems. 

I mainly developed this style because, like me, there are many night-owl students and users in the world and the current style is very bright. This style configuration will darken much of the Canvas CMS user interface to make it more appropriate for users.
