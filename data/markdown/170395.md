### Description
WARNING: This, along with the Late-2012, and incomplete 2011 theme, will cease to function, as Google will get rid of the classic layout (Which these 3 themes are built on top of). If you're interested in either of these themes, I suggest that you try them ASAP. The HTML5 Player skins will not be affected by this (hopefully).
