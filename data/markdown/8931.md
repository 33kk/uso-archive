### Description
Greatly condenses the PicLens Toolbar Button.  Removes padding, making the toolbar very small and minimal.  Excellent style for those who want to conserve screen real-estate.  Works on Firefox2 AND Firefox3 !!

This style allows you to fit more Bookmarks on your toolbar.  Buttons on the Favorites Toolbar will be closer together (smaller Size).

Applies to:
- Firefox 3
- Firefox 2 

Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.
Works for BOTH Firefox 3 AND Firefox 2.

Integrates with Style 7707.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Changed project name, to reflect Piclens now being named Cooliris
+ Still functions perfectly with the new piclens /cool iris icon logo
