### Description
This style will allow you to see what type of URL is present in a link.  For links to other pages, it will list where it's referencing it from (relative to the current directory, the parent directory, the root directory, or a full path) and shows it before the link.  Identification for fragment identifiers and query strings (starting with "#" and "?", respectively) will be shown after the link.

Different protocols ("file", "mailto", "javascript", etc.) are also shown, and custom ones can be added to expand the number of protocols that can be identified with this style.
