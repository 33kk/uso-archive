### Description
This is basically an update for the following userstyle by Valacar:  http://userstyles.org/styles/1210

I used Dr. Takato's style (http://userstyles.org/styles/19263) to return userstyles.org to its former layout and changed a few settings in the original Valacar style to make it compatible.  I also changed a couple of borders and the color of the install box background to suit my preferences.

Updates:
7/9/09 -- Rounded the bottom corners of the body element.
8/20/09 -- Increased margins of light gray box, since they were too small.
8/29/09 -- Increased padding at bottom of light gray box, since there wasn't enough.
10/11/09 -- Just realized I had a separate script that affected this one. Combined them.
