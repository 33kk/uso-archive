### Description
The blue and red colors for links highlight them too much in continuous text. This script will turn the colors off unless you really want to know and hover the mouse over the respective paragraph.

If the mouse leaves a paragraph, then its links will turn black (but stay italic). Visited links will be lined through. Links to existing and non-existing articles do not differ.

Links outside the article will not be effected. For Wikipedia the article is inside the id 'bodyContent'. However other encyclopedias use different ids. Install the Userscript Amalgam (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13348) in order to make the style work on them too.

For focussing on the article you may also find the Userscript 'Wikipedia Article Mode (automatic)' (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/88564) useful.
