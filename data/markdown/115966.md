### Description
osu! is pushing out the new version of the osu website. this theme may be updated but can't run alongside usage of the new site.<br>

UPDATE IF YOU INSTALLED THIS STYLE BEFORE: March 03 2017<br>

All inspired by a screenshot that was posted on EvB's Twitter, that's how I got into coding with CSS. This is the first design that I have been working on. <br>

I used <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/111979/osu-dark-transparent">"osu! dark transparent"</a> by EmingK as a template for my CSS

### Update notes
Supports the following Java Scripts:
- osu!plus
- osu! PP Save

Known Bugs/Oddities:

-Using the Dropdown menu animation will spazz out if your cursor movements are really fast. This can't be fixed without Java Script as far as I know


Fixed:

-When you are in the post form (Forum, Personal Message, Userpage), you will not be able to see the color selector that would be at the right side of the screen.
It appears that this small and compact code fixes it: http://pastebin.com/Tjgu30u4

-One of the tables in the wiki looks really ugly, but it seems like you can't work around it without it still looking bad. So I just left it unedited.
Fixing it was easier than I thought. Still doesn't look super appealing, but it's way better than before

-When using the Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script "osu!plus" the top play will not be highlighted
Added a temporary dropdown option for it. Will remove it when I find a smart way to avoid it.

-I have been told giving Kudosu to somebody looks odd, but I can't fix it because I don't have any.
Thanks to <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6777358">Stingy</a> I was able to see that giving somebody Kudos doesn't look weird to begin with.

-There is an ugly image on the E-Mail verification page. This will be fixed when I find the page again.
I am not exactly sure why but I had to verify my e-mail adress again so I managed to improve the look of the image.
