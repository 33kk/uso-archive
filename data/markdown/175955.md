### Description
Hello,
I'm Nedra, I'm 33 , Tunisian living in Switzerland 
I'm a student in Interactive Media Designer ;
and recently my programming teacher asked me to edit this page as a homework.. I chose to highlight the colors of the Amazigh flag, the ancestors of North Africa, my ancestors.
and maybe people who have never heard of the Amazigh tribe will stumble across this page and learn more about them.
