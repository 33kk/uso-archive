### Description
A fusion of 3 styles that I love (classypedia, clean wiki and  wikipedia clean white / links in the script). To create the perfect wikipedia style based on my requirements: sober, the content table is always there, it's easy to change the languages by putting your cursor to the left.

I hope you'll like it and send me some feedback if you try it :)
