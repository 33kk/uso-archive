### Description
CREDITS:
Reddit - insomnia (Original Style) BY - squid
Reddit - Dark Gray Wood Design Background BY - Sarge101
Fixes  - HellzStormer

I thought the Reddit Insomnia style by squid was awesome, though I added some preferred personal touches and posted the modified style. I also liked the wood background found in the Reddit Dark gray wood style and added it into this style.

### Update notes
UPDATED 3.13.15

Fixes added that were provided by HellzStormer. Thank You.

Style has been updated to support Reddits multi-reddit sidebar. Some broken issues were fixed, such as background image link dead, colors, and some other stuff.

An option has been added so there's now a choice of background. Options are dark wood background (default), or solid color background.

Any compatibly issues, post them up and I'll see if I can provide a fix.



MODIFICATIONS MADE:

-- Changed the main page Reddit logo since the original lettering was black and couldn't be seen.
-- Added the spoiler fix posted by doomed.
-- Added visited links code so all the visited links appear a different color. Had to remove some code to accomplish this, see below.
-- Increased the opacity on images, lowered it on some borders.
-- Added code so the Reddit Uppers and Downers Enhanced Userscript displays the up/down vote tally a uniform color.
-- Added the wood background found in the Reddit - Dark Gray Wood Design by Sarge101. To remove background, see below.
-- Lowered the opacity of the TEXTAREA, border was too bright.

In order to change the color of the visited links, I added the following code:

A:visited{
color: #426a92 !important;}

Though, the following code conflicted with what I added for visited links so I removed the conflicting code. Not quite sure what it's needed for, though if you're missing a function or experience odd behavior, then it might be due to the below code removed:

.tagline a.author, .tagline a.subreddit{
/*color: #718FAC #566E78 !important;*/
color: #566E78 !important;}

.title, .thing a {
/* color: #3D6288 !important; submission color */
color: #7E949E !important;}
