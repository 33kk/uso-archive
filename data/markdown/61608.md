### Description
Tired of never seeing your desktop background because your browser is always open and maximized? Try this.

Based on my "Aerofox Transparency" theme. I just added the address box and search box transparency on this one. I left the previous one as a separate theme in case you prefer the text entry boxes with white background (I go back and forth depending on the day).

Credits due to Satoz' "Discreet Transparency" and foxxyn8's "About:Blank Glass", which I combined and built upon to create a minimalistic theme close to the classic theme, but totally transparent, in the spirit of Windows 7 Aero.

If you installed this style, please take the time to review it and leave your feedback.
