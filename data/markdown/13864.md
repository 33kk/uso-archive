### Description
Description : When you use the browser for long hours, you suffer eye fatigue due to the bright background of most web pages as well as the browser. To remedy the browser problem please install (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1529) PitchDark theme of Firefox. But this solves only half of the problem. To remedy the appearance of web pages install Stylish Addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108) and companion-I. However the style is independent of the theme and works equally well without it. It renders the web pages in subdued colors which complements the theme.
