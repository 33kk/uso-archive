### Description
Dark Blue Google stylish template takes the boring old google and turns it into a cool/awesome looking google. Created by: K. Rampling. For any reference you give out, or show in any video, please put a small reference in the corner saying By: K. Rampling. Enjoy Darkened Blue Google! This is NOT a copy. Do not even say anything........ Look at code? This changes look for almost all googe applications and side-tasks. Some of the logos are not darkened. I have a life. I'm not gonna go through the extra 5 minutes to edit them. If you use them often, edit them yourselves. I didn't edit them because I don't use them regularly. This is has almost the same outcome as Valacar's script. Although, it is not a copy..........It took awhile so don't even go to the point of saying it is......
