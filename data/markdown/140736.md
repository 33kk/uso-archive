### Description
This is a theme for the main page, forums, and info pages of Sonic Retro that adds gradients and a Sonic Mania background image/logo. This does spoil things, so only view the settings for this style if you want to be spoiled. The default background picture is Studiopolis Zone.

### Update notes
Sonic Retro upgraded their forum software, which broke this theme. Though it isn't as good as it was before, I've managed to bring back some of the old look by re-purposing the gradients.
