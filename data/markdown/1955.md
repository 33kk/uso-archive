### Description
1) Hide the dropmarker. I think it's simply unnecessary as you can choose your search engine via popup by left-clicking the icon.
2) If you don't want the popup to appear, i. e. if you only have Google search, you can hide it.
3) Disable highlighting the search engine icon indicating the site you're actually visiting offers adding its search to your searchbar.
