### Description
A (hopefully) all-encompassing dashboard theme for tumblr featuring Jackson Whittemore from Teen Wolf.

This is the most complete style I've ever attempted. It took hours, and was made for my twin. I don't ever want to attempt this full of a style again, especially since some of tumblr's annoying new quirks make certain areas look iffy regardless of styling.

<b>If you're having spacing issues</b> on the sidebar, try choosing 'no' on the "Slim Sidebar?" option. It's also important that you select 'no' if you use XKit's option to slim the sidebar instead. Otherwise, it's highly suggested you keep the sidebar slimmed as the buttons are horribly large by default.

<b>If you can't stand the background image in text areas</b> select the option to hide it. I'm now using a code which should work more consistently than the previous version. Let me know via feedback if there's a page where it doesn't work.

### Update notes
<b>June 17, 2016</b> - Slim Sidebar and Slim Radar have been consolidated into one option, seeing how the sidebar is basically only the radar (and supposedly an ad? man, I love adblock!) nowadays. This option squishes the sidebar back to a reasonable size and moves the content back closer to the center to counteract the fact tumblr's design team is composed entirely of two-year-olds with finger paints.

<b>January 2016</b> - Fixed toggle for the post button on top bar.

<b>July 2015</b> - For some unknown reason, tumblr has started using double the glass effect on reblog forms, which was leaving the dashboard underneath useless and still blacked out (or blued out, whatever) after the form disappeared; basically, this fixes that.

<b>April 2015</b> - Made my best effort to deal with the cluster(you-know-what) that is the new top bar.

<b>12.04.14</b> - Fixes issue where post avatars were no longer showing. This does currently make the 'do you use xkit' function unnecessary, but I'm leaving it in case changes are made again.

<b>11.10.14</b> - Fixes weirdness when choosing to hide the header's compose button.

<b>10.31.14</b> - while I'd love to hope this new update is tumblr's Halloween Costume or something since it's so weirdly coded, there <i>are</i> elements I'm sure are here to stay regardless. Went ahead and drove myself crazy fixing the style.

<b>10.13.14</b> - tumblr changed the class of the search bar; I've updated the style to apply to it again

<b>09.12.14</b> - Fixed some unintended white areas on Chrome.

<b>08.19.14</b> - Today's update brings minimal support for the search function, including an option to remove the blog results from displaying (off by default). I can't do much more with the search function, as I loathe this feature and avoid it myself, due to its inability to function well with my slower internet. I've also transitioned to a more inclusive moz-document rule which should require less upkeep but may be changed back if I find it's causing undesired style effects on odd pages of tumblr. Finally, I've tweaked and fixed up some places which were appearing the wrong colour etc. and changed the 'plexi' overlay for reblog forms etc. to a less obnoxiously clashing shade than the default tumblr blue.

<b>08.14.14</b> - Once again having to fix issues caused by tumblr changing things up. Should no longer have the tumblr blue background. <b>Second update today is to fine-tune the fix so you won't have unreadable settings pages.</b>

<b>07.27.14</b> - fixed a typo which broke this style on tag pages for ssl-secured accounts

<b>07.22.14</b> - fixed some unreadable sections

<b>07.21.14</b> - second update for the day; fixed post permalinks to no longer have traces of tumblr blue

<b>07.21.14</b> - <b><i>New option of themed 'new posts' and 'new mail' indicators!</i></b> (code for this effect altered from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/99781/winter-stars">Winter Stars by saibapanku</a>) removing the background image from text editor is also now more stable and thus the recommended, default option; i'm leaving it optional, however, as I don't believe in removing choices just in case someone prefers the background appearing there

<b>07.17.14</b> - fixed more breakage caused by tumblr's insistence upon switching up css classes more often than humans change clothes

<b>07.10.14</b> - Fixed blog controls for SSL Security enabled users. Sorry for the oversight!

<b>06.27.14</b> - should now work with SSL security enabled

<b>06.24.14</b> - deja bleepin' vu. more fixing of things tumblr's needless css class changes have broken

<b>06.18.14</b> - fixed more breakage caused by more needless css class changes on tumblr's end. I'm starting to understand why so many tumblr themes end up abandoned by their makers, eugh.

<b>06.17.14</b> - fixed breakage caused by a needless css class change on tumblr's end

<b>02.06.14</b> - Fixed the recommended blogs, because tumblr thought it was a brilliant idea to switch from #recommended_tumblelogs to .recommended_tumblelogs 

<b>01.15.14</b> - The new version of tumblr radar is now styled to match the theme.

<b>12.16.13</b> - This latest update should fix compatibility with xKit's Read Posts extension which dims posts that you've already viewed. It should also fix an issue I recently encountered in which the content of post-reply notifications was squished and unreadable. 

<b>10.19.13</b> - After seeing some issues caused by the built-in sidebar slimming on my separate sidebar themes, I've decided to make it optional on my dash themes just to be careful. If this theme was working fine for you, with no weird or unmanageable spacing issues on the sidebar, feel free to skip this update and/or keep "Slim Sidebar?" set to the default option of 'yes.' Otherwise, you may wish to try selecting 'no' for "Slim Sidebar?" to see if that fixes the issue.

<b>10.17.13 - 02</b> Fixed up the sidebar the best I could. Sadly, it's still chunkier than it used to be with my theme, but I've still slimmed it some and reinstated the difference in colours to combat tumblr's change toward a flat layout. Next I plan to try and fix the other elements that were borked by the change, such as notifications and the recommended blogs.

<b>10.17.13</b> - I am so done with tumblr's changes, you cannot imagine... Had to destroy the section that slimmed the horribly large sidebar thanks to the updates. Am trying to figure out a way to reimplement it, but don't hold your breath. Sorry, everyone.

<b>09.07.13</b> - Fixed a sudden change that was making avatar styling break. <strike>This may be xkit-specific, and if so I will update again to make the fix optional for xkit users.</strike> This is xkit specific, so please be sure to choose whether you use xkit or not. It defaults to yes, as I've noticed no errors from using the xkit-altered version without the extension.

<b>Update:</b> Edited to fix an oversight where part of chat posts were blinding white. Also updated to work with both tumblr's default chat post style and xkit's classic interface tweak.
