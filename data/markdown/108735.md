### Description
<p><b>You can choose</b> between random banners, a fixed banner, or a custom banner or album by clicking <b>Advanced Style Settings</b> below!  (See the Additional Info section for custom album syntax.)</p>

<p>A style to re-add banners on Fimfiction.  This is expanded from CSS by <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/user/PiercingSight">PiercingSight</a>, posted <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/419886/fixing-the-happening-adding-banners-back-to-fimfiction">here</a>.</p>

### Update notes
Version history below.

This style puts a selectable banner on the front page, and uses the same banner as a background for the user- and story-page headers (also blogs).

You can pick any of the old banners here (hosted on imgur), or use a simple randomizer script that I'm hosting (kinda buggy because of weird CSS element caching).  Email me if you make a new banner, and if I like it I might add it to the random album and here.  NEW: I modified the randomizer script so that you can use your own album.  This is in case you just want one that's a subset of my album, or want to curate an entirely different set.  In the 'provide your own' URL field put <q><a href="">http://derpy.hopto.me/ffb/random.php?album=&lt;album ID&gt;</a></q>, where e.g. the default album's ID at http://imgur.com/a/s3YIn is the 's3yIn' part.  It may, of course, look terrible if your images are not in a proper banner resolution.

Any suggestions welcome.

History:

<ul>
<it>v2.04.  Changed the front-page styling so it would be centered on large resolutions.  Should also better accept banners of any size now.
<it>v2.03.  Something changed in the non-user/story page layout.  Now positioned absolute only on those pages, relative by default.
<it>v2.02.  It was pointed out that the banner was hanging around when the nav bars were pinned, which is less than ideal.  Moved banner's anchor to the start of the content elementâ€”seems to work okay?  Also added some kludges to make it work alright on various pages (site blogs, browse, etc.)</it>
<it>v2.01.  Fixed a pixel error introduced by knighty's further fiddling.  Refined story image/avatar placement and sizing in user/story headers.</it>
<it>v2.0.  Modified to work with 'FimFiction 4.0' as knighty is calling it.  Because of the prominence of the new logo, old logo overlay is now RIP in pepperoni.  Some more transitions for readability and consistency between front page and user/story pages.  Still just disabling if Fimfiction Advanced is detected, but if enough people ask, I'll figure something out.</it>
<it>v1.04.  Modified to work with 27 May 2015 changes to the site, including making the new 'author bar' auto-hide.  Interoperability with Fimfiction Advanced is probably toast, and I won't have time to check/fix for a while.  Testing comments/code mods welcomed.</it>
<it>v1.03.  Added new behavior when <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Sollace">Sollace's</a> Fimfiction Advanced is in play: keeps FFA's banner selection while tweaking its user/story header aesthetic to be (IMO) smoother.  And it gets rid of the creepy avatar zoom.  :V  Note this requires the newest versions of FFA, available <a href="http://sta.sh/01pfv954kl8r">here</a>.</it>
<it>v1.02.  Added specifiers for author search pages.</it>
<it>v1.01.  Added specifiers for blog pages.</it></ul>
