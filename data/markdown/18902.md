### Description
Not made by MBlue. Not sponsored By MBlue. I just edited the addons script for stylish. Enjoy.




New style to fix minor bug I can't fix in this style soon.

EDIT: got rid of excess code, recolored the background and category bar.
Still can't fix the weird space at the top, if anyone can help, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks in advance

EDIT: more cosmetic changes, FINALLY got rid of the weird spacing at the top.
