### Description
Allows you to customize a toolbar button's icon using Firefox's built-in set:

chrome://browser/skin/Toolbar.png

Different addons have different methods of placing the icon. This style is incredibly basic and may or may not work. Feel free to tinker around though.
Inverts as necessary for personas. See Notes for install directions.

### Update notes
You'll need the ID of the button (DOM Inspector and Element Inspector addons). 
Firefox's australis menu is "#PanelUI-menu-button", Tab Mix Plus' recently closed tab list is "#btn_undoclose", the one added by Personal Bookmark Menu Button is "#personal-bookmarks-menu-button", etc.
Once you know it, put it in the field. If it's too long to fit in, edit it after installing.

To choose which icon, count how many icons from the left the icon you want is on toolbar.png.
Large back arrow is 1, the home icon is 6, the folder is 12, etc.
Set that number for the other field.
