### Description
I was getting really tired of the pale yellow default XDA Developers Forum style, so I took a few minutes and swapped all the yellow tones out for dark grey ones.  I'm no CSS expert, but it looks good to me, and much more pleasing than the yellow.  Hope some folks like it.

Known bugs:
 - Some graphics on site are still yellow/brown

Fixed bugs:
 - Top navigation bar when hovered the text disappears.  THANK YOU sickbox!
