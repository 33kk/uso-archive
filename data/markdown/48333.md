### Description
Gets rid of all the unnecessary stuff and leaves just Scrabble.  Even hides Facebook chrome, including menu bar, game feed, and chat.

** Update:  the following is outdated and no longer works. **

If you are on Windows and your browser is Chrome, you can create an application shortcut which opens Scrabble in a separate window, as in my "after" screenshot:

1. Browse to http://stuff.vicshih.com/userstyles.org/scrabble.html.txt

2. Right-click that page and "Save as..." an HTML file such as "scrabble.html"

3. Open the file in Chrome

4. Create the initial application shortcut from Wrench | Tools | Create application shortcuts...

5. Right-click the newly created shortcut and choose "Properties"

6. Edit the Target field, changing the "--app" parameter to refer to your saved HTML file using the file:// protocol; replace spaces with "%20".  For example, "--app=file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/<user>/My%20Documents/scrabble.html".
