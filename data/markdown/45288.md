### Description
It's mostly just edited colors from the "black like your soul" style found here 
userstyles.org/styles/25527/4chan-black-like-your-soul

It also (somewhat) works with the 4chan plus extension for chrome. It has not been tested on firefox.

Updates to come

change the font size of the date on posts
the links at the top are pseudo inline due to font size and removing of the twitter, Q&A, and status links, will make actually inline
style yotsuba, yosuba b, so on so forth, will get rid of it
giant ass border on hover of posts, will get rid of it
all white hover to OPs post, will fix
different backgrounds for different pages, black for NSFW boards, grey otherwise, will add.
doesn't apply on homepage, when it does, messes with other pages, might fix
getting rid of the (password used for file deletion) notice, will get rid of it
