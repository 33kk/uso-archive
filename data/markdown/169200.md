### Description
Want the option to hide practically anything in the navbar? Use this style! Lot of customization options to give you the ability to hide any button in the header other than the sync button or the user menu button (though you can hide anything under the user menu other than the settings and logout buttons). Use this style as a tool to customize what you want to be able to see/access in your Habitica experience! (Image shows every option set to hidden.)

### Update notes
Shows logo, tasks, group, challenges, and help by default. (Hides "overview for new users" in help dropdown.) Shows gold count by default, but not hourglasses or gems. Hides everything within user menu by default except settings and logout (which do not have the option to be hidden by this style at all--it's possible to hide them, I just didn't want it to be something someone did on accident). The group option does not have the option to hide any dropdown items if you're in group plans.

Several of these options have other ways to be seen, and all that go to pages are visitable by writing the url in your address bar. (The only things that can't be seen anywhere else are the hourglass and gem counts (though they are visible on your balance in shop modals when you try to buy an item). You may want to think carefully about hiding those.)

Not sure if hiding the messages option in the user menu will suppress the message count if you get a message. I think not, but I haven't been able to test, so we'll see. If it does, I'll make it so that number is suppressed if you have messages hidden (you may want to set your account to opt out of private messaging in the message window before hiding the message item in the dropdown if you do that). EDIT: 2019-03-08: It does still display the count, but hiding the count felt irresponsible if you ended up in a situation where you were still able to receive PMs and you got an important one (i.e. from a mod or staff or just someone important to you) and you never saw it. The code is included but hidden between comment code /* like this */ which you can remove if you want to hide the number on the icon as well.

Known issue that hiding certain items in the user menu will take their dividers with them. Not sure there's a way to fix it.
