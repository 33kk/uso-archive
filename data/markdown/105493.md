### Description
If the standard display of a case in Lexis takes up too much horizontal space, this style helps. It hides the "related content" panel on the left side (better than clicking its "close" button), removes the useless (to me) outline bar on the bottom navigation bar, moves the "select a reporter" box from that bar to open space at the top, and adds some color. The display easily fits side-by-side with a word processor without overlapping.
