### Description
0.9.1 Removed the Deal Pwn image
0.9 - Removed the Bitter Wallet stuff from the side bar (thanks to vibeone)
0.8.1 - Added support for removing the blue temperature figures from the forum listing
0.8 - Fixed the boxes on the right of the page to display correctly. Also removed the heat indicator infront of the thread title
0.7 - This is a funny update as i am bringing back the things that made me start this in the first place - the statistics boxes!! This time they are back in a more streamlined form and take up way less space. Let me know what you think. I have had to make some of the text really small to squeeze it all in. The reason that i brought this back is incase Admin decides to add some useful feature there. I wouldn't want you missing out.
0.6 - Time for another major update. This time i have concentrated on the full view look. Each deal/post in full view is now contained in its own block. Added a border to this block for greater readability. Also adjusted the padding to bring the text away from the left edge.
This also affects the first post in a thread, this is now contained in a white box with a border. Minor tweak - changed the colour of the link that takes you to the last post. All links seem to be blue on the site and i thought it was rather unintuitive to have this particualar link in grey.
0.5.2 - Another minor update. The "posted by..." text has been moved back underneath the topic title
0.5.1 - Minor update to change the height of each row that contain the topic title (can see more topics at a glance now). Also tweaked spacing between topic title and "posted by ..." text
0.5 - Updated the look of the thread view. Made clear defination between user information on the left and the message on the right. Also made the forum quotes look a little nicer - increased text size, removed the gradient background image, removed the mahoosive quotes!
0.4 - Removed the infamous white background. Added a border around the table that is the forum for easier distinction
0.3 - Optimized readability and functionality of the page links
0.2 - Reduced the size of topic titles and moved the "posted by ..." text onto the same line. Increased width of "last post" column slightly so it all fit in properly
0.1 - First release. Removed statistics boxes from the right
