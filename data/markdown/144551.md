### Description
This is legacy version of my 'YouTube 2017 - Fade watched videos' userstyle.
Enhances the readability of your subscriptions by dimming (fading out) videos you have already watched.

Very simple little change, but helps a lot to distinct what to watch next. It's made for latest Youtube's Material Design layout. Enjoy.
