### Description
Fixes the new YouTube to make the new home page look like the old one. It's not 100% accurate and it probably never will be because of the way YouTube is doing the grid now, but its pretty much 99% the same and you probably won't notice the difference. Features:
<ul>
<li>Increasing number of videos per line</li>
<li>Decreasing font sizes</li>
<li>Removing profile pictures</li>
</ul>
Works fine with light and dark mode and probably other userstyles as it is very minimal
