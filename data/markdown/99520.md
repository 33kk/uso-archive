### Description
I slightly tweaked <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/60790/toodledo-sitewide-restyle-feb-2012">HostileCombover's "Toodledo - sitewide restyle - Feb, 2012" style</a>, which was last updated in 2012 and thus did not take into account the "Outlines" and "Lists" features added since then. The only thing I couldn't quite figure out was how to remove the blank Menu space in the upper lefthand corner of those pages. 

Tested on newest Firefox and Chrome
