### Description
This amazing website http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com/ contains really interesting content submitted by users, but when we're trying to view all of them, it's difficult because the visited links have the same colours as all the others. So I added a few features to make it easier:
- Different colour links
- Underlined links
- Margin to separate items from lists of links
- Different colour to identify links when you hover over them
In fact it just makes the list of options on the right and left hand side menus more user friendly by increasing margins, making visited links gray, and underlining and highlighting links.
