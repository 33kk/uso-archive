### Description
Since the use of third party mapping utilities results in ban from Ingress, I made this script to take the less-than-useable stock intel map and make it at least somewhat useful. The main change is the map now fills the entire browser window instead of a small pseudo-screen. Also, all useless information has been removed to make the map as clean and clear as possible. The only things remaining are the search functionality as well as the portal filter options.
