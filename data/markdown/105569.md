### Description
This Style is for people who are annoied of using skygo.sky.de with a dual (or more) screen setup.
Because of the community ignoring developers of sky I have developed this addon.

It allows, that you can view the videos in fullscreen 1080p and use your other scren for working on it. But now the Video does not minimize again if you click on the other screen.

Hope this might be useful.

Tips: Press F11 to set fullscreen mode of your browser.
