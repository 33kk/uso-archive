### Description
Make Gmail backs to the old style (part of). When I modify the style, I find out that there're still some good changes in new style, so I just keep them, such as the new type scroll-bar which preventing the left column being scrolled when you scroll the mail list. 
This style is a combination of old style and new style of Gmail, so do not expect it bring you exactly the old Gmail. But it should looks good.

In this style I merge these great themes below, maybe you want to just use one of them:
