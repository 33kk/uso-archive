### Description
Apex learning futuristic theme with dark background in shades of blue-green colors. The theme Laser Apex Translucent Images Ver. shows content like images and animations in dark color with a dark cyan shade.
I couldn't resist to insert a pun in the top right of the screen. (Ape Learning)

### Update notes
This theme can be customized by pressing the "advanced style settings" button below, for now you can change the background and the hue of the text and foreground.
Since the webpage is composed of two websites the hue will change to have double colors.

Please send feedback, mistakes, or suggestions!
