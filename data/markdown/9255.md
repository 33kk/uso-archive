### Description
Some minor adjustments to the look-and-feel of tabs with TabMixPlus on Firefox 3: Changing the background color of the active tab to "white" makes it better distinguishable (in TMP, you can only change the text color, but not the background).

The progress bar enhancement was taken from style 300 - I removed the fixed color of the bar, since this can be configured from TMP settings.

Enjoy!
