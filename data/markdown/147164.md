### Description
Outlook has several advertisement banners: in the right side and one in the bottom when the window is small, this style remove them. The "Upgrade" banner is also gone.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> This version can be very brittle, but I'm improving it yet.<br/>
<b>Note 2:</b> The intention of this script is to remove some banners that are no detected/blockable by an adblocker (although it can work, it's not tested or supported without it).
