### Description
FFF Light modifies the new bTech Blue theme on the FFF to create a balance of readability with a wide variety of font colors and usability for those who find white text on black backgrounds hard on the eyes. Version 2.0 is even lighter and more usable than ever before and adds some much needed aesthetic appeal as well.
