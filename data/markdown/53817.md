### Description
Scriptish's green scroll icon is pretty awful. I tried to find a style that would remove it, and although style 46828 does so for the button, the green icon is used in a bunch of other places. I created this style to replace the green icon everywhere.

The green icon will be removed from the script install arrow panel, the infobar on userscript source pages, context menus, the about:scriptish page, the options page, toolbar button, and menuitems created by the Extension Options Menu add-on.
