### Description
Darker revamp of the Google News page

Wrote this one at work today :) I'll try to keep it updated and let me know what you think!

*** Updated 021511 - Now works for international versions of Google News. NOTE: If you're not logged into your Google account, international versions of Google News seem to default to the older two column format which is unsupported by this script. After logging in, it should switch over to the one column format and look fine...

*** 100112 - Wow, I hadn't looked at this in months, glad to see it's still being downloaded. Obviously it could use some attention on a few details...I'll try to give it some time when I have some to give. I know Google News has many different layouts and views, so your feedback on general experience or noticed flaws is certainly appreciated. - Thanks, Marcus
