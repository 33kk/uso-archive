### Description
A Material Dark Theme for Laravel Docs. Based on Jetbrains Material theme.
Three themes available: Oceanic, Darker, Palenight

### Update notes
Feel free to suggest some improvements. 
I won't change elements order or position, only colors and typo.
Maybe a bigger typo in code blocks?

If your eyes like it, I did the same on some other well-known websites with the same theme:
