### Description
A crude, but functional way to make Happy Wheels run in full browser window. You can then simply maximize your browser window (ie. F11 or View > Full Screen or similar depending on your browser) to make the game run on full screen.

To get out of full screen you need to leave the page and disable full screen browser mode, since the game takes over the full window you can't use the usual browser hotkeys.
