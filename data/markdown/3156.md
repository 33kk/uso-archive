### Description
This style is designed to be used with the IJ Skins: Class Adder [ http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/11289 ] Greasemonkey script. Note that it will *not* work on its own.

This is adapted from snakeling's sample scripts and furiosity's site scheme here: http://userstyles.org/styles/3152  

It is meant to be used with the "New Tweak" InsaneJournal site theme.  

The main changes are to change the background color to white, the font to Verdana, and keep the header banner looking normalish with a grey background.

Edit 20070814: change the dropdown menu font back to Ariel since it's less wide, make the pulldown menus wider so you can read more of the text in the menu.  Also fixed bug where user polls would get a grey background.
