### Description
A theme I whipped together to help my eyes stop bleeding when browsing my courses.
I only touched the surface on modifications, so some things are still white.

I focused on:
- Modules page
- Dashboard
- Left side navigation bar
- Inbox (minor changes)
- Course selector pull-out

If you want to yell at me for something being white, or to say thanks, you can find me on Discord: Para#2248
