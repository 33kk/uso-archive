### Description
THIS STYLE IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED ON THIS SITE. TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UPDATES, PLEASE INSTALL THE STYLE FROM THE <a href="https://github.com/Devo7v/UserCSS">GITHUB REPO</a>.

This style themes the Google Bar across multiple Google sites to a dark theme.  This was developed to match the Dark theme for Gmail as well as my <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/102256/google-calendar-dark-style">Google Calendar - Dark Style</a> and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/138245/google-contacts-dark-style">Google Contacts - Dark Style</a>, <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/135941">ben999_</a>'s <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/62121/google-voice-dark-style">Google Voice - Dark Style</a>, and <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/277242">DeathTBO</a>'s <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/112421/dark-fusion-google">Dark Fusion - Google</a>.

Every item in the CSS has descriptions so you can edit it as you see fit.
