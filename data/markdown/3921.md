### Description
Two other styles (style 353 by user 176 and style 1450 by user 1237) already remove ads, but they both have the same 2 flaws:

1: on the calendar in week- and day view, they remove the time displays
2: in Google Labs, they remove the Graduates, which show up on the right side of the screen.

This version solves both problems for now (that is, until Google changes the layout again). If anyone finds another problem while using my style, post a review telling me about it and I'll see what I can do.
