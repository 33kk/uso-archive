### Description
A fork of my style 43346, using the Zenburn palette.

EOL Update:
Applied style to entire site
Fixed regular reply (for real this time)
Increased post width (who needs to see the entire board name anyway)
Fixes for 4chanX (the menu actually appears)
Included User 62774's form fields from Compact++
/b/ackwash tooltip borders match the replies.
Made page table visible, as well as the stylesheet chooser (necessary for a fix)
Simplified font styles (no more underline, sad but true)
Fixed input fields using generic arial.
FLASHBLOCK BONUS: Shrunk blocked flashes to 20x20 icons, instead of representing the size of the unblocked flash.
Other general unfinished business taken care of (all syntax errors *cough* *cough*)
