### Description
Trello is super ugly... Even a search in the Userstyles Library still keeps it ugly... So what to do? Give up? Of course not... ;)

I'm using Trello as my main organization tool every day, so I've developed this full theme over time and thought: Why not share it, so others can also enjoy it!? So here it is.

It also will fix the issue with oversized background-images. Every image will fit now with 100% width and auto height. 

I will keep the code up-to-date if Trello changes something.

Just make sure you don't miss the full experience and install the "Muli" font on your computer from Google Fonts. ;)
