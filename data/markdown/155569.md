### Description
This is a simple userstyle that hides the scores of matches on the Olympics website. The Olympics website has Full Replays available, but for some reason they place the replay button right next to the score. What were they thinking?

Note: It won't prevent you from being spoiled if you look at the medal count or if they wrote an article about the results, but I found it useful when navigating the various game pages.
