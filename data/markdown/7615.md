### Description
Inspired by style 1937 from user 2063 combined with code from http://www.wizzrss.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=47#p181 - Higmmer to have smaller buttons in sage-too and http://www.wizzrss.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=47#p202 - fragerfox for (Aero) live bookmarks icon set.
Only successfully tested on Vista.

Tested in sage 1.4, but this has undesirable results as new buttons are introduced.
