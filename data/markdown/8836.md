### Description
Hides the Add Task and "ALT + a" text at the bottom of the SlimTimer client.  Removes check boxes from the tasks to prevent marking a task complete.

Intended for those who define each task to be equivalent to a project (and tags are used to indicate the tasks worked on). And the set of projects one works on is fairly constant (do not add new tasks (projects) very often).
