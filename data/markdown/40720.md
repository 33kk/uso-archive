### Description
{ { FIREFOX 4/STRATA40 BACK/FORWARD NAVIGATION BUTTONS } }

*| PLEASE NOTE |* 
This userstyle will install *only* the LARGE FF4 Back/Forward Buttons:
Here is the link for the SMALL FF4 Back/Forward Buttosn:

(I had to split into two separate styles bc the code was apparently too long) >_<
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This userstyle changes the hideous default, (or which ever theme you are using)'s, Back/Forward navigation buttons- yay!- to the Firefox 4/Strata40 ones (see images below). 

I hate the ugly green default Back/Forward buttons & love the Firefox4/Strata40 ones- and while the Strata40 theme is lovely, it doesn't currently work with Personas (poo on Personas for only working with Default theme) - I want what I want- and what I want is Strata40 Buttons w/ Personas. They are neutral & compliment any Persona Palette, and, plus, are semi-transparent.

// As noted above, the small & large set are split into two separate userstyles- this style will install the LARGE Back/Forward buttons + the dropmarkers. //
..........................................................................................................................................

{{- IMPORTANT -}} You MUST  have the correct size buttons installed/enabled (Large or Small) to match whatever your toolbar is set to display: Large buttons > install/enable the userstyle for Large buttons / Small buttons on your toolbar > make sure you have the Small buttons userstyle installed/enabled. Otherwise there will be an empty space in place of where the buttons should be. Very simple solution though: install/enable the correct userstyle! 

This "bug" occured when I had to split the code, which had originally been written as a single userstyle, into two separate styles -- I am fairly new to coding/CSS & had used MBlues Vista Nav Buttons (blue) as a guide/base- I will try to figure out how to fix it the correct way as soon as possible.

Any other issues or problems I will try my best to fix or assist with.  =^._.^=

{{ 1 LAST NOTE! }} *both the "Before" & "After" shots seen below are actually two "After" shots- one image shows the buttons & the 2nd image is a screenshot showing the buttons in use w/ the "Woody" Persona.
