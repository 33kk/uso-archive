### Description
This is an update of my earlier style for the latest version of Firefox. Since Firefox now allows you to hide your Menu, Navigation, Bookmarks, Add-On, and Title bars (with the Tabs on Top option), I've collapsed my entire UI to the Tab bar for a truly minimal, clean interface.

With this style installed, you'll see nothing but your tabs and the urlbar. No ugly orange Firefox button, no favicons, no nothing. You'll save on vertical space, too.
