### Description
This userstyle add the favicon to Diigolet bookmarklet. The Diigolet bookmarklet  is a very powerful bookmarklet to annotate, share and bookmark web pages using Diigo a social service like del.icio.us but better.

If you would like to have only favicon with no text ("Diigolet"), move the '*/' placed at the end  of the code in this line:
/* Uncomment the following lines of code for hidding text and show only favicon. Good to save space in your toolbar  

In "before image" you could see bookmarklet in bookmark toolbar, in "after image" like it appear if you apply the modify explained above (only favicon without text). 

I have used a dark theme for screenshot, but don't worry the favicon is transparent, it adapt at any background color of your bookmark toolbar.
