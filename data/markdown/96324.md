### Description
Dark Global Brown is an espresso brown makeover of all websites. It is very easy on the eyes and I use it most everywhere. It does have some minor issues at some sites but works very well at most. On sites that have issues I usually just add on a style for that site and the combo works great. Thanks to Dreakert for nearly all of the code.
