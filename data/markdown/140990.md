### Description
A streamlined, customizable theme for Asana with more whitespace, team separators (sidebar), and a cleaner task list. Oh, and I've brought ♥s back! (Choose in Advanced Style Settings below before install or update.) Wider custom field columns (if you got 'em) for better usability. Oh, and thicker project highlight colors next to project names. Lots o' little things to make your Asana experience better. Updated regularly for the good of all mankind...and my own sanity. ;)

### Update notes
<strong>Streamlined Asana</strong> v1.0.5 (Hearts Edition)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<strong>Note on Custom Options:</strong> To change options before install or update, click the Advanced Style Settings button above and make your choices!

<strong>Note on sidebar background color:</strong> You should choose a medium to dark color. Otherwise, you will not be able to read the light colored text.

<strong>Note on section header background color:</strong> You should choose a light color. Otherwise, you will not be able to read the dark colored text. (Note: This color will also apply to group headers on the "My Tasks" screen for consistency.)
