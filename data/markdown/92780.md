Tumblr 'new post' icons for your dashboard.

"<i>Chibi is a Japanese slang word meaning "short person" or "small chimp." The word has gained currency amongst fans of mangled anime. It can be translated as "little," but is not used the same way as chiisana (tiny, small, little in Japanese) but rather cute.</i>" <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_%28term%29">*</a></sup>
