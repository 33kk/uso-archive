### Description
style 1788 removes the search box.  I found that this left some empty space so I wrote this to put the search box back.  This style is for use in addition to style 1788.

This is written for my archaic screen resolution of 1024 x 768.  If you have a larger screen you can increase the value of #txtListingsSearch for aesthetic purposes.

20 March 2010 - Fixed after recent changes.

16 December 2010 - Fixes a problem with the url. If you weren't experiencing problems you don't need to update.
