### Description
Version 1.0.2 - Updated March 18, 2009

This script is a complement to the Glasser extention for Firefox 3; it fixes some of the appearence elements that are lost after applying Glasser.

In particular:
- The left side of the address bar is curved similarly to the default theme in Firefox 3
- Padding is added below the navigation toolbar to improve appearance
- Some other minor visual enhancements

This style was built and tested using Firefox 3.0.7 w/ Glasser 1.0.16,  in Windows 7.
Other versions/platforms are untested - feel free to try!


Installation:
- Download the Stylish extention
- Click the button below, "Load into Stylish" (there is an option to preview first, if desired)


Credit goes to Len R, PixiWork, Phin; elements of their work helped to make this style.
