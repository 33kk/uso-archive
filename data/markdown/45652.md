### Description
Automatically hides the navigation bar. When you hover your mouse over the toolbar, the navigation bar is shown floating above the page. If you activate the URL bar directly through keyboard shortcuts such as CTRL+T or ALT+D, only the URL bar is displayed. Buttons / anything else on the navigation bar can be displayed by hovering your mouse over the toolbar or over the URL bar. I prefer this version over my old one.

Note: 
-This style was created with tabs on top in mind. This userstyle becomes inactive when tabs on top is disabled.
-A version without animation is provided for low end computers.
-This style assumes the standard navigation bar size of 28px. If you are using a theme that modifies this, you will have to adjust this style.
-This is an alternative to my old style: style 45531
The difference is that this new version does not annoyingly shift the layout down when displaying the navigation bar.

### Update notes
Changelog:
Version 1.10:
-Small change to fix version 1.9

Version 1.9:
-Added "No hover" mode: enabling this means the only way to access the URL bar is by pressing ALT+D.
Use this if you have *only* the URL bar and the search bar on your #nav-bar

Version 1.8:
-Fixed a bug when tabsontop=false

Version 1.7:
***Added experimental mode where the hover zone is limited to a 2 pixel row for the navigation bar; the default option is for this feature to be disabled***
-High contrast buttons are now optional
-Slightly tweak hover timing to have less delay
-Refactored CSS

Version 1.6:
-Tweak toolbar buttons to appear less transparent when placed in nav-bar; improves visual contrast on dark or varied backgrounds.
-Tweak margins and shadows slightly

Version 1.5:
-fix missing semicolon causing ordinal grouping to break

Version 1.4:
-fix iconsize=large logic

Version 1.3:
-temporarily undo a change causing the URL bar to collide with the other toolbars when iconsize=large

Version 1.2:
-Implemented suggestions from Bringo
*ordinal group 101 to allow nav-bar to appear beneath bookmark and custom toolbars
*new option to account for scroll bar width
*tweaked animation duration
*removed TabsOnTop=false case; if you want this functionality back use style 45531

-allow search bar to be focused when referenced directly by shortcut keys

About the "account for scroll-bar" option: this option pads the navigation bar to the width of the scroll bar. This cannot be done dynamically, as far as I'm aware. This is why it has been made an option.

Version 1.1: 
-Very minor correction to URL bar size.

Version 1.0:
-Initial release
