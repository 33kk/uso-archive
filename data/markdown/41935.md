### Description
Gives MC's header a makeover.

Applied over Minichan Modern Purple (or any deriative of with the same colour scheme).

Thanks to r04r for giving us the ability to hide menu items.

Tested on Safari 5 but should support all browsers.

Well, that was a rocky start but all the problems should be fixed now. I Love You Allâ„¢
No, the header logo isn't clickable.
