Compatible for Tab Mix Plus in Multiple Row Mode and FaviconizeTab.

In addition, this is including two alternative throbber icons (in tabs) and you can select which icon to use by commenting out and removing comment.

I'm still refining some coloring adjustment so I would be very glad if you let me know when you have made a nice one(><)b.
