### Description
This is a tweak that fixes basic usage problems and adds a little prettiness to the new Facebook layout introduced in Feb 2010.

This style has been tested with Firefox and Chrome.

It:
- sticks the position of the top nav bar so it stays on the screen when you scroll
- adds a log out button to the nav bar for easy access
- blinks the new notifications icon to make it more obvious you have new notifications
- also provides some visual tweaks, such as rounding some corners, adding drop shadows, and adding subtle animations (Chrome only).

I will update to fix if the basic functionality is broken by Facebook, and may also add other features.

Note that each feature is commented, so if you do not want a specific tweak, just comment it out or delete that section of the style!

Also, check out style 33680 - install it on top of this userstyle to round the corners of your Facebook!
user 28400 has done a great job on it, and keeps it up-to-date.
