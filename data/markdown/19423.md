### Description
I have been using dark gray and black system themes under windows and linux and have found many sites ugly or unreadable, especially when it comes to forms. 
This theme would fix them, providing ‘better’ default colors for most elements.
It even “fixes” the Fire.fm bar :-) (thanks to direct help from Jorge Villalobos)
