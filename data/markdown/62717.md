### Description
For Firefox 3.6+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.

This style is for those that just use Yahoo Mail for checking their Email Inbox, it mainly focuses on getting rid of the unnecessary stuff like the page header and footer, and Web-ads. It also moves the 'Yahoo Navigation Sidebar' to the right-side of the screen, which is beneficial for those who like to zoom-in on the Yahoo Email Inbox webpage without the need of having to adjust the horizontal scroll-bar position to be able to view the Email Inbox in the center of the screen.(<b>Note: Not all Web-ads may be removed, If you still see some I suggest you use the Add-on Adblock Plus</b>.)

Tested on Firefox 3.6+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds. (<b>Note: I only tested style on Yahoo Mail Classic, so it may not work well on the New Yahoo Mail.</b>)

Modified code from Userstyle:

style 59376
