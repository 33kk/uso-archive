### Description
This style  1) removes the file type label Google adds before the link of a search result, 2), "File Format" to the left of the the listing for what the filetype is, and 3) adds the icon for that particular filetype (specific system uses for that file type).  Neat, huh?!  :-)     (see screenshots)

Those individual items are commented and can be selectively used or not, as you like - simply remove or comment out the part(s) you do not want.

It applies to regular 1) Google search results, 2) Google Linux specific search results, 3) Google BSD search results, and 4) Google Microsoft search results.

I started this style to include the filetypes that Google says they support, but there are obviously more.  I have changed the code to only include these types.  If you know of filetypes that work, but Google does NOT "officially" support, please feel free to add them as you like.

Thanks!

If you like this style, please refer to style 2502.

P.S. - This style also fixes the broken layout encounted when viewing one of the included filetypes while using the BetterSearch extension.
