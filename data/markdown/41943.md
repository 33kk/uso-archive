### Description
In December 2010, Geocaching.com changed the "found" image on the cache list from a red checkmark to a yellow smiley. On one hand this makes sense, because a yellow smiley is used on the cache pages to denote a find. But on the cache list, the gray background makes the smiley very hard to see, and it is hard to differentiate the smiley from the yellow star that is used to denote "hides." This userstyle brings back the red checkmark.
