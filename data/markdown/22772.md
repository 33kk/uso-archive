### Description
Changes the default entry and comment font on Journalfen from serif to sans-serif.  Unfortunately this affects not just siteschemed pages but some journal front pages as well, meaning that some (like the Fandom Wank front page) come out looking slightly odd :/  Not being terribly tech-savvy I haven't figured out how to fix this yet.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to make it only display with siteschemed pages, please do let me know.

May require a restart to completely disable after uninstall.
