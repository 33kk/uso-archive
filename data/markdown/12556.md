### Description
"I don't wanna close my eyes!  I don't wanna fall asleep; I'd still miss you babe.  And, I don't want to miss a thing.  Even if I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do."  Etc.

This style is dedicated to Aerosmith, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.

It cleans up Seattle Post Intelligencer a fair bit.
