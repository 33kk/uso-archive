### Description
Disable the annoying animated favicons that appear on certain websites.

What does it do? (Features):
- Removes animated fav icons from the URLBar (left of the awesome bar) where the site identity button is
- Prevents animated icons in the awesome bar list
- Prevents animated favicons from becoming your bookmarks icons (either in bookmarks toolbar OR bookmarks menu)
- Prevents animated favicons from appearing in your Back / Forward history menus
- This style ONLY blocks animated (GIF) favicons... Don't worry, this style will not ruin your website viewing experience, it will make it better!


These can be very distracting and idiotic.

** This code was taken from Lifehacker, which was taken from The How-To Geek (http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/365590909/how-to-block-distracting-animated-favicons)

** You may need to Refresh the Page and/or reset your browser for this to work.

Remove Annoyances!

Integrated Styles:

Call for help:
Try this website: http://favicons.pouessel.org/frame.html    Everything is working fine, except for the bookmarking.  If you bookmark this page, it will display an animation... I tried to code a block for it, but It would not block, any help would be great!

Changelog:
1.0.0.4:
+ BUGFIX: Site identity for sites that change the name of the .gif now fixed.

1.0.0.3:
+ BUGFIX: Above, I mentioned that you can rename a .gif to .ico and it will still animate and not be blocked.  Well, I managed to hack in a way to check if it has been renamed, and this update will prevent those types of favicons (looks at content type).  - Test this update here (http://favicons.pouessel.org/frame.html)
= Expect one more update soon, that will do the same, but for the site-identity button.

1.0.0.2:
+ BUGFIX: There was a bug where the icon shows up in the tab's favicon (tab bar) - now NO animated favicons of websites show up on any part of the browser!

1.0.0.1:
+ Now working perfectly, thanks to user 13489's Fix (will be global style now).
+ Moved out of obsolete mode, now that the style is working
