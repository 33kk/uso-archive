### Description
I wanted a style for personal use that satisfied some basic conditions, however none of the styles fulfilled my needs.

This style features
-A dark style that's easy on the eyes especially at night.
-Legible font.
-Readable font colors.
-A floating image that can never get in the way.
-Functions as advertised with every 4chan setting turned on, even inline quotes.
-Includes home page, posting/error pages, and catalog.(Everything needed in regular browsing on the site)

To change the floating image simply change the picture link at the very top of the html.
