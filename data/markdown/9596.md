### Description
This style removes all ads from the NEW Facebook site (specifically, the right side "Sponsors" bar) and changes all fonts to Calibri.

** Update 03.18.2k13 - Probably right before Facebook launches their mobile-inspired News Feed redesign. Again, I'll keep trying to update it when I'm able to.

** Update 09.08.2k9 - Tried to fix as many UI issues as possible after Facebook released their latest batch of changes. Hopefully it works out nicely for you all!

It will probably be eternal-ware, in that I will always be updating as I use Facebook (which is moderately, so check for updates once a week or so). 

I hope you enjoy!
