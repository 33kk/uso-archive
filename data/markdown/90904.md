### Description
This style reverts some of the unfortunate changes introduced in May 2013 to Flickr's designs.
Flickr users who felt disheartened by the design change, this is for you!

My final goal is to disable the justified view, if it can be achieved via CSS. 

Current releases bring :
- reduced load time and memory footprint,
- photo title on top!
- no floating bar!
- many other improvements
