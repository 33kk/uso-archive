### Description
I love "style 728" and "style 640", thus I use both of them.
But there are some conflicts when using them at the same time.
So I combine and optimize their codes, also I add domains for Google.tw and other areas.
And I add styles for Reader and AdSense Reports, then here it is.

Please take a look at http://picasaweb.google.com/chiahsien/StylishForGoogleService for more detail.
Suggestions are always welcome. :-)

Update @ 20081222,
For Google Reader,
  1. Google Reader becomes pretty and useful, but some of my codes break its layout. So I removed those codes.

Update @ 20080817
For Google Reader,
  1. Make each article's content area 100% width.
  2. Highlight when mouse hovers over the list-view title.

Update @ 20071122
Removed codes for Gmail.
I've made a new one for Gmail 2.0, please give style 4211 a try!.

Update @ 20071015
Some miner tunes.
