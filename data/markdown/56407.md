### Description
***THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE DUE TO GOOGLES LATEST UPDATE. WILL BE FIXED SOON***


It's the standard Google+ layout except improved greatly. 

- It will adjust itself to the resolution you are using and take advantage of your monitor.
- The side menus are fixed and will always be there, even when you scroll for easy access.  

In a time where widescreen monitors are common, Google decided to make a thin STATIC layout (probably for phones). 
I didn't like that, not one bit.

The screenshots are re-sized and were taken on a 1920x1200 monitor. I have tested this all the way down to 1280x1024 which is the minimum res for this to work as intended.

Tested in Chrome and Firefox!
