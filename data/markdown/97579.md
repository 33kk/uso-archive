### Description
Just some tweaks I made because I didn't like tweetdeck's default style.

I did a version with no scrollbar too (instead of showing them on hover) -> http://userstyles.org/styles/97578/tweetdeck-moar-flat-design-no-scrollbars

Changes:
- Everything is now squares (no rounding)
- Column titles take less space
- Hide scroll bars until mouse is over the column (still scrollable via mousewheel)
- Button labels do not show
- Composing
