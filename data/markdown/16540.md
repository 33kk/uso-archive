### Description
For the MMORPG Swcombine.com

For the black scheme. For best results, use the version for your chosen skin. If you frequently change skins, use one of the universal schemes.

Replaces lit/blinking alert icons with the unlit version. By default this affects all buttons. If you wish to re-enable any of the buttons, remove the comment marks (slashes and asterisks) from the beginning (just before "img .." and end of each code block. Refer to the Flashnews block as an example - don't remove the comment marks around the title ( Flashnews, Darkness Message, etc.)
