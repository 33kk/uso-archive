### Description
So, perhaps some of you don't actually mind the default gray and pink or gray and purple site scheme and just want the content on the default pages to stretch out properly and maybe for the text to be slightly bigger. IF SO THIS IS FOR YOU

Basic tweaks included in this skin:
--Stretches entry and comments across the page (100%)
--Removes the color border from the bottom of the comment headers 
(also lightens the gray a bit)
--Changes background to white
--Makes font bigger (9pt, same size as LJ classic w/Verdana)
