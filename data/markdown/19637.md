### Description
Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America IE NACA  https://www.naca.com/  Is one of those sites that seriously needs some margins so you can read it with out going from one side of the screen to the other.  Also their links were not very clear so I gave them a white background.  The site looks much better and is easier to use this way.  I contacted their webmaster and offered some suggestions but never got a response.
