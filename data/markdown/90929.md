### Description
Deep Dark theme for SoundCloud; you can adjust the colors

### Update notes
Built on BamaBraves's SoundCloud theme.  Works with new SoundCloud, not classic.

For a more relaxing listening experience, disabling comments is recommended: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/142182

Soundcloud now uses small cover art in some playlist, if you want the larger setting back, so that it looks the same as the screenshot above, you can install 'SoundCloud Large Icons' http://userstyles.org/styles/90983/soundcloud-large-icons

Updates:
2013-07-24: dark text-input fields, fix tag coloring, dim adverts
2013-07-25: fix on-hover tag coloring; buttons are now darker and better contrasted
2013-07-26: highlight Play button when playing
