### Description
This style highlights the rows and menus in Gmail when you hover over them.

Colors are customized for the "Classic" Theme of GMail (which is the old one!)

If you are using a different theme, you may want to check the following styles:
- "Default" Theme: http://userstyles.org/styles/12303
- "Tree" Theme: http://userstyles.org/styles/12304

I would like to credit this theme (http://userstyles.org/styles/678) for the inspiration.

Check also this other theme (http://userstyles.org/styles/6896) if you want all google site to be displayed in Segoe UI.
