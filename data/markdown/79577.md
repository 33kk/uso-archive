### Description
This is a five-second hack, centering YouTube's home and settings pages. Video pages can also be centered, but the "fix" is extremely simple and hacky, and I have commented it out.

I recommend using this Greasemonkey script to center video pages:

Or this script to work across all of YouTube:

Hopefully YouTube will come to their senses and stop left-aligning everything!
