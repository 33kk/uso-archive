### Description
This is a hacked together version of many styles on userstyles.org.
I just made many minor improvements, and added many new things.

it blocks ads, adds a background and changes many things to black and gray

this is completely compatible with facebook's current layout as of 5/6/08

most of it comes from style 4774, and style 3870, but there is a lot taken from other styles.

the before and after photos are both "after"
this is just to show how different pictures can be used.

background comes from http://xshock.de
recommended backgrounds are:
http://xshock.de/data/fullview/severed.jpg can't find image (after)
