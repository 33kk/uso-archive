### Description
<b>NOTE:</b> doesn't change the background. Doing so impossible because it has to be a global style. As such, you will have to install a theme from the Web Store.

A style that allows you customize much more of the google homepage, generally to be used with an appstore theme. Shouldn't interfere with other sites unless they have something with id fkbx. If you find any website that uses fkbx, please contact me. You can find the theme i'm using in the screenshots by searching "Into the Mist" on the web store.

Settings corresponding with the color coded screenshot:

• YELLOW - Searchbar
