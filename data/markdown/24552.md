Still trying to crack the problem with the homepage. There are some white background images that are a bit tricky to get rid of. http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/4419/mybbblack3.png

The problem is if you use the "background-image: inherit !important" property, it removes the white images but applies the dark background for all background images (such as the status envelope next to the thread title, so those won't display either). If you manage to get around the image problem, please let me know.
