### Description
1. Places a dotted border between rows in many views to more clearly distinguish them.
2. Changes the coloring of the rows. Rows for Selected journals are light shades of yellow. Rows for untracked journals are shades of grey.

I encourage you to choose the colors easiest on your eyes. Use a tool like ColorZilla to pick a color then edit the userstyle to use that color.
