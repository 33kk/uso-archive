### Description
Only displays the "OK" button when you make a change to Metadata Editor.

The order Footer buttons are backwards... this style fixes the problem by hiding the Cancel button.

You can easily just click [X], or escape on your keyboard, and this is a bug with the editor... 
Default buttons are OKAY CANCEL, but Songbird uses CANCEL OK, which really makes it hard to save the track details.

Program Versions:
+ Songbird

Also Try out:
+ Style 11998


Changelog:
- Initial Release
