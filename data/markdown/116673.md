### Description
<code><b>Update (2017): YouTube broke this and I can't fix it</b></code>
<br>The new minimalistic design of YouTube unfortunately broke the main feature of this style, and it seems there is no way to implement the full-featured mouseover menu (with quality and speed selection) again purely with css.
<br>So I won't be updating this style anymore ...sorry =(
<hr>
upgrades the Youtube html5 player with some awesome features like
<br><b>showing options on hovering</b> the bottom bar, <i>// broken by youtube design update</i>
<br><b>directly selectable speed and quality</b> (no more dropdowns!), <i>// broken by youtube design update</i>
<br>a <b>new minimalist fullscreen player</b> <i>// that's like the new youtube design</i>
and some other little tweaks and changes (appearance, animations, static ads (re)moved)
