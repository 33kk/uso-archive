### Description
In "large mode", makes Youtube full width for 1080p displays, sets the background to black and hides annotations and popups.
It looks like fullscreen, but in a maximized window.
If you switch Youtube to default view, it should revert back to normal and you can view annotations.
The size is hardcoded for Chrome with bookmarks bar enabled.
