### Description
The Government of Canada weather website (weather.gc.ca) recently changed its look to improve mobile device experience, and ended up destroying the desktop browser experience.

This Stylish theme improves the browsing experience for desktop PCs, by fixing a number of issues with the font size and text alignment on the new website.
