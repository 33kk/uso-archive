### Description
A flat TypeRacer style â†’ you'll never race the same again! New, easier to read font, more subtle error indicator in order to not distract you, fancy logo, less flashing. Inspired by Material and Flat design, with an emphasis on adding bright colors and not losing features, you can stop your search for the best TypeRacer theme ever. Ads are also removed, but I still recommend you sign up for TypeRacer premium, it's totally worth it for the avatars and profiles.
