### Description
This style widens Facebook.com to a more modern, responsive-style fluid layout, and minimizes the amount of content to a single column feed (hiding Ads, friend Activity, trends, Apps, etc).

The chat area on the right can still be used as normal.
The contents in the main left menu are hidden until you mouse over them.
