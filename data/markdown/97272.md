### Description
Instead of the dropdown list including Gmail, Contacts, and Tasks, just show them side-by-side. 

One caveat: you have to click on "Gmail" once for it to take effect (since the dropdown items don't exist in the DOM until then).

This is a modified version of style 62053, made by user 12179. This version works better with the default (light background) theme, while his version works better with dark theme.
