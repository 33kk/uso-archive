### Description
While this should still work, I'm not actively updating it anymore. If you'd like to continue to use Appchan, consider using Appchan X, which you can find out about here: http://zixaphir.github.com/appchan-x/ . New features include Opera and Chrome support, along with a bevvy of features made possible by Javascript.

### Update notes
Should work perfectly in Firefox with the various versions of 4chan x. Please report anything that is broken.

Chrome and Opera support may come back if I can find someone to maintain them, or I find the time and willpower to do so
