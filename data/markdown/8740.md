### Description
Remove certain things from forums (Either on the MySpace forums, school forums, or group forums)

Feel free to edit the code to suit your preferences. There's a list of things you can remove in the code.

Screenshots on old page:
style 5628
(The before and after screenshots are just screenshots, not before and after screenshots! The first one is for groups/school forums, and the second one is for the regular MySpace forums.)

EDIT: I added "blockquote blockquote" to the list which gets rid of blockquotes that're in blockquotes. This removes multiple quotes in posts. :) For anyone who's annoyed by pages that're looooong because the posters are too lazy to remove some damn quotes. (NOTE: This does not remove the quotes when you quote a post, it just hides them!)
