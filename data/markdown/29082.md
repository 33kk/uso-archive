### Description
This style moves the tabs to the top and provides a background colour for the toolbar, which IMHO looks much more slick then the default style. It is meant to be used with the "Compact Menu 2" extension, but some other menu-hiding extension would probably work as well. If you also would like to get rid of the window decoration, install "maximus" (in main). Run it with "maximus -m" to prevent it from maximising all your windows. 
There's a slight bug when you move a tab, the arrow that pops up is still at the bottom.
