### Description
Read about tracking changes in WorkFlowy in this blog post:
https://blog.workflowy.com/tracking-changes

** This style goes hand-in-hand with the (1) "WorkFlowy Track Changes - EDITING" style (which stylizes text deleted and added while editing) and the (2) "WorkFlowy Track Changes - ORIGINAL" style:

https://userstyles.org/styles/130950/workflowy-track-changes-editing
https://userstyles.org/styles/131042/workflowy-track-changes-original

What this style does is hide text marked up for deletion, as well as comments, giving one a final draft. This style needs to be toggled on/ off to show the final draft/ markups.
