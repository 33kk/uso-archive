### Description
Minimal tuning for Wikipedia just to read it a little easier. Just for article content. Larger text. Maximum width for article content that may be too long: paragraphs, lists, maybe I add some more later. PT Serif font family (if you have it into your OS; UserStyles don't allow to use Google Fonts “for security reasons” – uncomment `@import` if you want).
