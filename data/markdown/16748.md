### Description
This moves the filter list to the sidebar on the right and uses the spare space to make the stream wider.

================== NOTE ==================
The position of the highlights section and everything below it is NOT AUTOMATIC, so you have to just change the number in the line that says so in the code (I left a comment there).
For my filter list the height was 235px, just play with that till you like what you see (it changes from person to person because everyone has different friend groups and filter list items so there might be people with more or less items than me).
