### Description
The qtl's latest version has many things that bugs me.
So I did something about it.

1) Fixed the Option dialog by removing the big image and making is smaller.
2) Fixed the Tooltip popup by removing the extra padding and replacing the "Pin" image with a real "animated" Pin.
3) Customized the statusbar panel by changing the image, making is small and expand on hover. Not really sure about this customization. It's a little bit annoying but I'll keep it. It can be modified to expand when hovering only on the panel itself and not on the entire statusbar.

enjoy...
