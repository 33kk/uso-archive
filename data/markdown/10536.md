additional notes:

I changed the font to calibri. If you don't have vista or office 2007 (the font is  already included in vista / office 2007), and you haven't got the "Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats" or the "Powerpoint 2007 Viewer" installed (both of these include the font) you can download them from   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&displaylang=en and http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=048DC840-14E1-467D-8DCA-19D2A8FD7485&displaylang=en
If you don't want the hassle, you can just download http://rapidshare.com/files/145637552/calibri.zip and install the fonts by copying them to $windir/Fonts.
If you don't want calibri, change it under the /*sets font*/ section to something else. Also change the 17px just before it to something lower, as other fonts tend to not

I removed the rounded corners, since I didn't like them and I thought they didn't go well with the pink.

I changed the visibility of the floating post box to zero when not triggered by a mouse-over, because I thought the half-visibility was annoying to read text under it.

I added code to remove the new adds. This also removes the "- futaba + futallaby + yotsuba -
