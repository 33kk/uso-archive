### Description
Change the useful (but dull) Firefox's speed dial a.k.a. NewTab (url about:newtab )
1. Choose your favourite wallpaper, or just change background color.
2. Adjust both the size and position of the grid and thumbnails to use the full screen.
3. Have unlimited amounts of thumbnails by using the scroll function. 
4. Maybe add a discrete Firefox logo on empty thumbnails, or keep it clean? It's your decision.
5. Do a Google Search directly from the about:newtab page, or hide the searchbox if you don't like it! 
6. Change every single thumbnail's image if you don't like the original. Easy with my templates.   
7. If you choose same wallpaper as you use as Windows desktop background... you can together with my theme <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/116194/glassfox-australis-theme">GlassFox - Australis theme</a>  create a seamless illusion of transparency (optional of course).

To see how it all may end up, <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/64F">here is one example</a>

### Update notes
<b><mark>Nota Bene (Nov 14, 2017): 
Since Firefox 57 have arrived, this style will not be updated anymore! 
As long as you 1. don't update to FF57, or 2. use current FF ESR version, or 3. use side projects like WaterFox  = versions who accepts legacy extentions, and downgrade to Stylish version 2.1.1 this style will continue to work. 
But otherwise, this style belongs to the history. 
------------------------------------------------------------ </mark></b>

<strike><b>Always updated to latest Firefox stable version </b></strike> Please note, may not work proper on older Firefox versions. 

To get familiar with how it works, please have a look at this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KvNLkfh.jpg">overview</a>.
To simplify it, you do not have to edit in the css-code if you want to change the appearance. Just change the values in the options above. 
Here is a <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/BA6">table with suggested value</a> you might have use of. 

----------

Things you can do to make sure the Newtab feature work even faster/useful in general.
Write about:config in the address field. Then, in about:config page's search field, copy/paste this 
    browser.tabs.animate and set to: false
    browser.newtab.preload and set to: true
    browser.newtabpage.columns default is 5, set to : 6 (for 6 columns...or what you prefer)
    browser.newtabpage.row default is 3, set to: 6 (for 6 rows... )


<b>How to replace the images (edit in the code) - this is not necessary, but it makes the page load much faster:</b>

To change the wallpaper you will have several options. You can pick one of those preselected in the options. But if you want your own favourite it's also easy to do it manually.
Userstyles like this one can read a web-address, or a local stored file on your computer.
Anyway, you should <b>always</b> prefer download and save your images to your HDD/SSD because the page will be loaded <b>MUCH FASTER</b> with an image from a local disc than from a busy remote web-address!! Especially on larger images. 
1. So, find a nice wallpaper and download it to your computer. 
Let's assume in this example that you want to download the default wallpaper "Pier to nowhere" (file name: "http://i.imgur.com/yEjqwN0.jpg") and save it on the pathway d:\backup\
2. See line 65 in the code:  
url("http://i.imgur.com/yEjqwN0.jpg")
In this example you should change the pathway   
http: //i.imgur.com/  
to     
<b>file://d:/backup/</b>     
where the d: (or c:, or e:, etc) is the letter of your disc/partition, and "/backup/" is the path to the map (containing the file "yEjqwN0.jpg").
Following this example, it can look like this:     
<b>url("file://d:/backup/yEjqwN0.jpg")</b>
Obvious, you have to replace it with the correct path way to your own file.
         
If you want to <b>REPLACE THE ORIGINAL THUMBNAIL</b> with your own image? Just open my CSS-file -  I have done templates to make it easy for you. Follow the instructions and the templates starting at line 74 in the CSS-file.
Or (even better) install the templates as a separate style <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/106998/glassfox-c-y-p-newtab-thumbnail-mgmt">GlassFox - c y p NewTab, thumbnail mgmt</a>, as it's easier to manage and more flexible to use that way.

The <b>NEWTAB SEARCH BOX</b>, you can choose between three different redesigns in the options, or you can delete (hide) it if you dislike this function.
You can see how it looks on this <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/650">picture</a>.

When you <b>ADJUST THE MARGINS AND SIZE</b> of the grid and thumbnails, have in mind that this is a "trial & error" among the options. 
First thing you should decide is the grid's columns and rows. Standard is 5x3. I think it's too limited (just 15 thumbnails). On a large wide-screen monitor you can use 5x5 (then you get 25 thumbnails) or even more. 
It's important you also change the columns & rows in the about:config page, they should fit your choice in the option "Set number of colums... ". 
Write at the address field "about:config", at the about:config's search field write "newtabpage", and double-click on "browser.newtabpage.columns" (default is 5)resp "browser.newtabpage.rows" (default is 3) to change the values. 
As reference: My monitor is a 26", screen resolution is 1920px x 1080px. In the picture <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/651">example</a> above I have changed about:config's values to 5 (columns) and 5 (rows), and used all default values in the option section. That's all... 

Want to have a <b>SCROLL</b> function with more or less unlimited thumbnails on your NewTab page? 
Then first, choose in the option "Adjust thumbnail's size (height)..." above a value who best will fit with your grid, mayby the default value "153". Have a look in the <a href="http://dropproxy.com/f/BA6">table </a> for guidance. 
Second, change in about:config. Set more rows than can be viewed on screen without scrolling (e.g. 20 rows). This will force a scroll-list - that's it ! 
Now you have 5 coll x 20 rows = 100 thumbs. Want more? Just go ahead and change the rows (and columns) until you are happy...
It's also easy to rearrange the thumbnail's order afterwards, or add more from your bookmark-collection - just "drag & drop" to a location as you like.

Enjoy!
Feedback is always welcome.
