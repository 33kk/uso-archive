### Description
This user style changes the look of the current HTML 5 Player to look more like the Flash Player/2012 HTML 5 Player

### Update notes
Update 1: replaced the play button image with a better quality one
Update 1.5: brought back, and changed the "Next" button, plus the "Previous" button, and changed the volume slider
Update 2: Replaced the god awful 2017 YT logo, with the Pre-2017 one, plus a few small changes
Update 2.5: gave the "Theater"/"Default" mode button, proper icons (of decent quality), and changed the "Captions" button to look more different
Update 3: similarly to the 2011 player, a user style is added that almost repairs the YouTube player in full screen mode
Update 3.1: I ended up hiding the stream button, as that button manages to ruin the 2012 immersion
Update 3.2: Retooled full screen mode
Update 4.1 (AKA THE BIG REWRITE!... part 1): 
 - Replaced all imgur images for the buttons with ones from an actual atlas of the 2012-2015 (2012-2017 for flash) HTML5 Player
 - gave the buttons ":hover" elements present on the 2012 player (even gave the settings and caption buttons their own ":active" elements)
 - Made the right-click menu more accurate
 - Themed both the Mini Player icon.... and finally (almost), the "Play on TV" icon
 - Also made the settings box a little more accurate
Update 4.1.1(AKA THE BIG REWRITE!... part 2):
here it goes.........

-Added the pre-2017 YouTube spinner (That One Spinner With The Dots).... in a way
-brought back the full screen fixes
-Made the YT bezel accurate (in terms of border radius)
-changed the "Play on YouTube button" to be a little more 2012-2015 player accurate (It was actually added in November, but was not documented)
Update 4.1.2:
Made the progress bar centered until further notice due to YT updating the progress bar on the player
Update 4.1.3:
Progress Bar now fills the screen (Though it's kind of broken)
Update 4.1.4
Progress Bar now fills the screen (Though it might be different depending on your display resolution)
