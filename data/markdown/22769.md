### Description
It seems that when facebook changed, there was a small change that didnt seem to make sense. When you hover a link on the top blue bar, it doesnt take up the whole height of the bar. This fixes that small "glitch." 

Side note:
This also hides the footer, with the boring legal stuff and the link to change your language. to get it back just delete the following:

#pagefooter{
display:none !Important;
}
