### Description
Minimizes the "What's New" blog section of the Zillow Rentals (RentJuice) Dashboard...it does not remove it, but it does optimize the space to only show that there is something new rather than wasting space to display the entire content of a blog post.

Note* - This style was created before RentJuice was sold to Zillow so the name of the style will not change to ensure that the url is always the same.
