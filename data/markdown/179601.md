### Description
A customizable scrollbar for chromium browsers. It was inspired by the updated web version of Outlook that came out in 2019.

Works on Youtube.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Outscroll-Scrollbar/master/Outscroll.user.css">Install style as UserCSS</a> using Stylus for live customization.

### Update notes
LIMITATIONS:

Works with CHROME, OPERA, BRAVE and the new EDGE (any chromium-based browser that allows a userstyles or usercss extension).

DOESN'T WORK WITH FIREFOX! 
(And there's nothing I can do about that. Look elsewhere. Github and the FirefoxCSS Reddit are good places to start. Here's my own Firefox CSS repo <a href="https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Firefox-userChrome-minor-tweaks">on Github</a>.)

The scrollbar will show everywhere, sometimes even where it's supposed to be hidden. There's no way around it with CSS alone. If you don't think it's still worth it, this scrollbar is not for you.

VERSION HISTORY:

Version 1.2.2 (2020-02-14)
*Hotfix.

Version 1.2.1 (2020-02-14)
*Fixed the background on certain sites.

Version 1.2.0 (2020-01-29)
*Fixed a few problems with the svg images (arrows).

Version 1.1.0 (2020-01-28)
*Added multiple modifiers to allow for even more customization.
*Even the arrow colour can be changed now.
*I had to replace the arrow colour selectors by text selectors to force it to use rgb because the preprocessor couldn't read hex codes in a data url. The colour selector still works in the usercss for Stylus (see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Outscroll-Scrollbar/master/Outscroll.user.css">here</a>).

Version 1.0.0 (2020-01-27)
*Initial release.
