### Description
Rightclick -> View Image the screenshot to take a closer look on how it works.

My first user style (that i've submitted.)
What this thing does:
- black background
- transparent navigation, fixed to screen corners. (hovering over it will make it opaque)
- screen focus goes to the manga page, completely.
on OneManga.com

And....
- This script is really really messed up (source code) @_@, but it works well
- You may need a decent resolution (1280x1024 up) for this to work at its best
- Zoom the page at 100% the screen size for best results.
- This script will definitely mess with the home page, etc. I suggest that you select the manga through the drop-down menu.
