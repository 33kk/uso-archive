### Description
Firefox Australis theme with semi-transparent elements. 
- All tabs (selected, hovered as well as the inactivated tabs) have curved design, and are more or less transparent. 
- You can choose your favourite wallpaper as background (disable Personas if you have it installed). 
- The tabs are adjustable on their width. Normal tab-size is about 1/8th of the screen-width (approx. 200-220 pixels/tab), and the tabs will shrink to smaller and smaller size when more tabs will populate the screen (until a minimal value). You can control the behaviour in several ways, just try various min/max values by yourself. The default in this style is 205 px on all tabs (= regardless the amount of tabs they will not change in size).
- Change the tab's text-color as you like. Default is white color. 
- Other options: status bar, search bar, nav bar icons - default values shown in brackets.

### Update notes
If you also install <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/70561/glassfox-choose-your-personal-newtab">GlassFox - choose your personal NewTab</a> and use the same wallpaper in this style, you can enjoy an seamless integration of your wallpaper. Here is an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eQQQAAG.jpg">example</a>.

First-time-only: After installation, please restart for full effect.
