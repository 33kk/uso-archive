### Description
My eyes get tired from all the white web-pages, so I don't mind taking the time to make them dark themed. Black/blue/gray-ish Google Translator, that works with "any" website ending, such as: .com. I think I've covered everything, yet that would be close to impossible, but enough to not get blinded. Please enjoy and use it as you like, and feel free to change anything: colors, background, etc. Thanks! â™¥
