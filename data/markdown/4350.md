### Description
So I had a bit of free time and thought I'd help out the Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter-day Saints by enticing some new people with an updated version of the site.  

This script could really be used with almost any site just need to change the domain info to be whatever you want it to be or give it a try as a global one.  Change out the background image to be whatever you want it to be in the "body" section.

Most of the color stuff in this is set to "transparent" so as you modify it from site to site should work out well with a bit of tweaking.  

As an additional point - its funny to me how people who don't contribute anything are always the one to discredit the work of others (In case you can't figure it out Bugmenot123 I'm speaking about you)  Fuck off- oh and have a nice day!
