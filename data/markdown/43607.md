### Description
This style is no longer being maintained and has some issues in recent Firefox releases.  You may be interested in <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gtk-native/">the GTK+ Native theme by Mike Henning</a> instead.

This user style makes the tabs in Firefox 4 on Linux a native look and feel, like tabs in other GTK+ apps.  Tested with Firefox 4.0 Stable on Ubuntu 10.10 with a slightly modified version of the Ambiance theme (only colors were changed).
