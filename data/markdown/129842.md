### Description
DuckDuckGo's dark theme is almost perfect.  Only problem is a flash of white, and depending on how long it takes to load the page, can blind you when you're on a long searching stint.<br><br>

This theme simply colors those parts that flash white, the rest of the DuckDuckGo theme really is good.<br><br>

I've kept the coloring in the grey tones to match the already grey-toned DuckDuckGo theme(s).
