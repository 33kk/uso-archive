### Description
A style that changes some colors/visuals/images to be similar to what they were before the sweeping site update. (Makes no/minimal changes to the layout--i.e. hiding a few things or slightly changing the presentation (a la my change to the challenge list).) Presentable but not remotely close to complete, probably, at least not in terms of my vision for it. Basically, treat this style like it's in beta until I say it's not.
