### Description
Prevents Google Suggestions from showing up while typing in a search query.

Pages Supported:
 www.google.*
 google.*

How does it work?
This style removes the table box that appears below the search box.  This table displays the Query Suggestion and the amount of pages each has. 

Why?
For those of you who like the old Google Layout, and who don't want to go into the settings (Google preferences) every time you go on a new machine.  Essentially, this style allows you to search your own way, without advertising influences and such injections.  
This comes from an idea I looked at on Lifehacker (no code provided on Lifehacker.com, just the idea.)

Works on:
-Firefox 2 
-Firefox 3 +

Changelog:
- Initial Release
