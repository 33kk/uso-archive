Don't like old Ken but like new Kentin? Try this style out! Change Ken to Kentin.

You don’t have to like Kentin to try it! You can add it just out of curiosity! It’s easy to turn off.

What it does;

-Switches out all of Ken’s sprites to Kentin Sprites.

What it doesn’t do;

-Change dialogue

-Change illustrations

I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised. :3

All you have to do for this to be yours is download “Stylish” to your browser and then go to this link and download the style! Simple!

I’ve added the other site versions for this as well (Amour Sucre, Corazon de Melon, etc.)!

Thank you to Driada/EldaryaNightmare for help with the coding!
