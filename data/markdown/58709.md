### Description
This style disables the Tweet box at the top of the page and the tweet box that usually appears when a tweet is expanded to see comments.  It is useful if one does not want to tweet by mistake when searching for other content on the site.  It is a very simple hack.

If you like to tweet, then this is not for you. :)
