### Description
Makes the reddit side bar slide in and out when you're not using it.

Google Chrome Users: If the sidebar is used, you type into the search bar or a do a page search and it finds something in the side bar the page will scroll to view the side bar. I cannot, as far as I can see, fix this easily while still being able to view the sidebar while it is slid in and it is not an issue on firefox.

If you come across this issue you can scroll back using middle mouse scrolling or by hovering your mouse over the sidebar.
