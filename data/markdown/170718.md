### Description
A legible style with some color options for JIRA 7

The goal of this style is make JIRA fonts more readable and provide an "easy on the eyes" experience for JIRA users.

### Update notes
Several Google Fonts are supported and selected font is used for all UI items. Roboto is default, if you want to try another font use the "Customize Settings" button before installing theme.

Five color schemes from <a href="https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors " >Material Designs</a> are provided. (Teal, Indigo, Amber, Blue Grey, Deep Orange) Teal is default, if you want to try another scheme use the "Customize Settings" button before installing theme.

UI colours are modified to increase contrast. Headers, side panels and dropdowns are given distinct backgound colors. 

There are some small modifications to UI layout to decrease empty spaces.

Tested on JIRA 7.13
