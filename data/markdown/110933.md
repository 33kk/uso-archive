### Description
The new analog devices is a so called "modern" website. That means padding and margin settings on all elements should be atleast 32px, so for every page loaded you need to scroll down 2 page-lengths for any usable information to appear. 

This userstyle should fix that (unless they change their mind again) and compress the information much more densely on your screen.

Disclaimer: I have optimized this style for 1080p screens. Your milage may vary on older machines with e.g. 1280x800 screens. .
This style may affect other parts of the sites not tested yet; like the community, design center and other info pages. The style is optimized for browsing parametric tables & product pages. 
Additional improvements may be made in the future.
