### Description
This is a little thing to help you make your scholar a little more true to what you imagine.

Use the customization to upload a 344px x 812px edited image of your scholar edited or a separate image by you.

IMPORTANT:
Due to the allegations against the add-on/extension "Stylish" for stealing internet history, I would recommend you to use an alternative. The one I'm currently using is Stylus.

Also, this does not work with illustrations, so make sure to have on the hair/skin/clothes/etc that you want your illustration to be.

### Update notes
To use this, upload an image that is 344px x 812px with whatever you want to be in the Dashboard/My Profile where your scholar is shown. This does not change your id image on the "My Profile" page.
