### Description
Greatly condenses the Bookmarks Toolbar.  Removes padding, making the toolbar very small and minimal.  Excellent style for those who want to conserve screen real-estate.  Works on Firefox2 AND Firefox3 !!

* Thanks user 3934 for the update for the margins!

This style allows you to fit more Bookmarks on your toolbar.  Buttons on the Favorites Toolbar will be closer together (smaller Size).

Applies to:
- Firefox 3
- Firefox 2 

Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.
Works for BOTH Firefox 3 AND Firefox 2.
Why install an extension to do this, when you can do it through CSS!?

Integrates with Style 7463, and Style 7461.

Changelog:
1.0.0.1:
+ Added Margin shorthand property content.  This GREATLY reduces the bookmarks toolbar, squishing the icons together.  Thanks to Lain_13 for the code & suggestion.  Continue to suggest on my styles, I am open to suggestions, and glad to write a new style if you want!
