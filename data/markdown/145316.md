### Description
Various space optimisation tweaks.

 - Hide scrollbars without breaking scrolling.
 - Precisely configure column width. (It can go much smaller than smallest built-in setting!)
 - Adjust tweet actions and below-tweet compose box to account for small columns.
 - Reorganises the tweet so text now wraps around and under the avatar and take less space.
 - Enables hyphenation so tweets take less space.
 - Hide the column header so tweets have more space:
   * On column hover, a little floating tab slides down from the top of that column.
   * Hovering over <i>that</i> then slides down the full column header (with the settings etc).
 - Various additional tweaks to make the above work beautifully!
 - Each column gets a colour of the rainbow, which is also used by the sidebar icons (with my related Sidebar userstyle), for quicker visual recognition
 - Works best installed alongside BetterTweetDeck
