### Description
Columnized (or 'boxified'?) search results. Great for huge monitors or widescreen TVs. I have a 3200x1080 desktop, so I hated the fact that all my search results only occupied the 15% of the left side of the screen while the rest lay unused on the right* The style in the preview is combined with "Darker Google" by Zigboom Designs.
