But a friend wanted it, so I figured I should make it available to everyone.\r\n\r\nQuick summary of what this does:\r\n- Indicates new additions to posts and grays out inactive blogs.\r\n- Rearranges posts to be more condensed.\r\n- Hides ads and suggestions\r\n\r\nI personally use this alongside a pretty basic XKit setup, but it seems to work the same with or without XKit.","user":{"id":437163,"name":"BabblingFishes","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"https://babblingfishes.tumblr.com","about":"[UPDATE: Due to Stylish's frequent server issues, I am in the process of moving my userstyles to GreasyFork. I will not be returning to Stylish until the site issues are fixed.]\r\n\r\nI'm a web developer with some visual/attention issues, so I end up coding little styles to get rid of things that make my life harder. Some of them have the side effect of being fun and aesthetically pleasing, too.\r\n\r\nI try to make my code easy to read for both people and machines, so you can edit my styles to suit your needs. If you need help with something, or if one of my styles broke, you can ask me about it on my tumblr.\r\n\r\nAlso note: I don't frequent this site; I only post things here as a place to keep them, so I'll probably end up adding things that have been done before. Sorry about that.","license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-08-04T18:47:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":23,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/180096_after.png?r=1596566844","url":"/styles/180096/fish-s-tumblr-dash-tweaks","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"www.tumblr.com\") {\r\n/* bumps username to right */\r\n.reblog-list-item .reblog-header,\r\n.reblog-header {\r\n    padding: 0;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    text-align: right;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* gray out inactive blogs */\r\n.inactive {\r\n    color: #999999;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* highlight contributed content */\r\n.contributed-content {\r\n    border-left: 10px solid rgba(0,150,255,0.25);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* removes unnecessary padding but also makes images pop out a little which is odd */\r\n.reblog-list-item {\r\n    padding: 0px 10px 10px 10px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* removes lines at the top of posts and associated padding */\r\n.reblog-list {\r\n    border: none;\r\n}\r\n.post_header,\r\n.post_full .post_header {\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* removes avatar and that \"deactivated\" text that only shows up on hover */\r\n.reblog-avatar, .reblog-tumblelog-deactivated-status {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/*** hide ads ***/\r\n\r\n.yamplus-unit-container, .standalone-ad-container, .video-ad-container, .remnant_ad, .post[data-sponsored], .dfp-ad-container, .timeline-yam-plus-ad-container {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/*** hide reccommendations ***/\r\n\r\n/* recommendations when liking a post */\r\n.rapid-recs-container,\r\n/* radar (sidebar) */\r\n.radar, .radar_header, .controls_section_radar,\r\n/* recommended blogs (sidebar) */\r\n.recommended_tumblelogs, .recommended-blogs-unit-header, .sidebar_link,\r\n/* recommended blogs and tags (search/explore pages) */\r\n.tags-and-tumblelogs,\r\n/* 'ask x about y' banners */\r\n.takeover-container,\r\n/* 'watch on yahoo view' buttons */\r\n.recommendation-reason-footer, .div[data-yahoo-view-link] {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/*** new ***/\r\n\r\n/* ads */\r\n._1aQrn,\r\n._3bMU2,\r\n._2HNMQ,\r\n._2QPW9 {\r\n    background-color: #FF0000 !important;\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* blog recs & radar */\r\n._2biQz,\r\n._3LdQR,\r\n.zstKO,\r\n.SVPap {\r\n    background-color: #FF0000 !important;\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
