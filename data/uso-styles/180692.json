I use Reddit at work for work related things, so I don't want other people to think I'm browsing Reddit instead of working. Hiding the Reddit logo makes the subreddit logo more evident and if anyone's watching my screen they wont misunderstand what I'm looking at.\r\n\r\nI also found myself wanting this style at home since the Coins button is a big eyesore and Reddit looks much cleaner with dark mode and without that big yellow button.","user":{"id":271657,"name":"acolombo","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://www.acolombo.eu","about":"Graphic Designer studying Software Engineering","license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-03-02T09:05:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/180692_additional_35809.jpeg?r=1595146119","url":"/styles/180692/reddit-hide-logo-and-coins-button","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.reddit.com/\") {\r\na[aria-label=Home], #COIN_PURCHASE_DROPDOWN_ID {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
