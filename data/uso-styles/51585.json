{"id":51585,"name":"Twitch.tv Bigger Player+Chat","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"twitch","subcategory":"twitch","style_tags":[],"description":"(This Style is for Classic Twitch) This style changes the way the Twitch.tv channel pages and directory are displayed. It makes the flash player larger and will make the chat larger and wider, with slightly bigger font size. This Style also removes all the ad boxes around site, but it does not affect the Ads that are played by the broadcasters. If you want to support a broadcaster, this style will not interfere with that as long you make sure to leave Ad-Block turned off. This Style also reverts the Channel Directory back to the old format, with smaller preview boxes and more channels being displayed horizontally.","user":{"id":111333,"name":"jabu","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-11-12T20:42:32.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5270,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/51585_after.jpeg?r=1589357004","url":"/styles/51585/twitch-tv-bigger-player-chat","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":5,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"twitch.tv\"), domain(\"twitchtv.com\"){\r\n\r\n/*[[Resolution]]*/\r\n\r\n/* [Ads Boxes] */\r\n#ad {display:none !important;}\r\n.a300, .managed_ad, .advertisement, .hide_ad small {display:none !important;}\r\n.ad_leader dir_leader{display:none !important;}\r\n#Twitch_DirLeaderv2_holder{display:none !important;}\r\n#Twitch_DiropaBanner_holder{display:none !important;}\r\n#facebook_logging_in {display:none !important;}\r\n#facebook_cancelled {display:none !important;}\r\n#adaptv_ad_player_div {display:none !important;}\r\n#chat_redisplay_holder {display:none !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
