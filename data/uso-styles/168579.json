I will not be returning to Stylish until the site issues are fixed.]\r\n\r\nI'm a web developer with some visual/attention issues, so I end up coding little styles to get rid of things that make my life harder. Some of them have the side effect of being fun and aesthetically pleasing, too.\r\n\r\nI try to make my code easy to read for both people and machines, so you can edit my styles to suit your needs. If you need help with something, or if one of my styles broke, you can ask me about it on my tumblr.\r\n\r\nAlso note: I don't frequent this site; I only post things here as a place to keep them, so I'll probably end up adding things that have been done before. Sorry about that.","license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2019-02-05T03:53:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":13,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/168579_after.png?r=1583395271","url":"/styles/168579/tumblr-remove-gifs-on-error-pages","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"tumblr.com\"), domain(\"txmblr.com\") {\r\n.fullscreen-background {\r\n    background-image: none !important;\r\n    background-color: /*[[bg]]*/ !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* get rid of \"Posted by X\" since we aren't seeing the gif anyway */\r\n.error-message-post-attribution {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
