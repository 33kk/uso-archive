  "additional_info": "Posting this since there had been enough interest by users of Kinja websites to get rid of it, and some people are too lazy and / or too arsed to learn anything CSS.\r\n\r\nThanks to zigboom's <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/46651\">Darker Kinja</a> style for the domain name block. If there is anything missing from that, let me know.\r\n\r\n<i>Update 11/22/17.1</i> Somehow through posting the code in multiple fields on Kinja the double-hyphen for the selector targeted became an em dash. Resolved.\r\n\r\n<i>Update 12/08/17</i> Added AV Club, alphabetized domain list.\r\n\r\n<i>Update 01/21/18</i> Happy new year! Added the in-the-middle articles regardless of how they're related because that can take a piss also. Comment if you'd rather want those back, thank you.\r\n\r\n<i>Update 02/17/18</i> Alright Kinja, screw you. Recent videos in the <b>front page?</b> Yeah, no.\r\n\r\n<i>Update 08/16/18.1</i> Videos that just load and autoplay in the browser. Alright Kinja fuck you too.\r\n\r\n<i>Update 08/16/18.2</i> <b>Oops</b> I broke it again. Oh well, fixed.",
