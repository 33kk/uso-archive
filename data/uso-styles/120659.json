To change your selections, delete the style and reinstall it.\r\n\r\nIt does not hide Pet Eggs or Quest scrolls (except where otherwise indicated) since those usually don't display clear images of the animals. \r\n\r\nEmail me at lady_alys@oldgods.net to have other types of creatures added or if you find that the existing settings don't hide all the items they should. If you don't hear back from me within a week, please email me again.\r\n\r\nWhen an avatar uses one of the hidden backgrounds, the extension hides the full avatar, not just the background.\r\n\r\nHabitica wiki page: http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Phobia_Protection_Extension","user":{"id":270835,"name":"LadyAlys","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-08-14T06:11:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":5,"total_install_count":415,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/120659_after.png?r=1597385473","url":"/styles/120659/habitica-phobia-protection","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"habitica.com\"), domain(\"habitrpg-staging.herokuapp.com\"), domain(\"habitrpg-delta.herokuapp.com\") {\r\n/*[[animations]]*/\r\n/*[[bees]]*/\r\n/*[[beetles]]*/\r\n/*[[dinosaurs]]*/\r\n/*[[dragons]]*/\r\n/*[[ghosts]]*/\r\n/*[[monkeys]]*/\r\n/*[[nudibranchs]]*/\r\n/*[[rats]]*/\r\n/*[[snails]]*/\r\n/*[[snacklessmonster]]*/\r\n/*[[snakes]]*/\r\n/*[[spiders]]*/\r\n/*[[spookysparkles]]*/\r\n/*[[skeletons]]*/\r\n/*[[zombies]]*/\r\n}\r\n"}
