  "description": "I love Feedly, the beautiful front end for <strike><del>Google Reader</del></strike>* feed reader. However, my middle-aged eyes don't. The text size for entries and summaries is just too small, and the category labels are too low-contrast. I finally decided to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo here's a very simple user style to make Feedly as comfortable to read for myopic infofreaks as it is stylish. It should be easy to tweak for your own needs.\r\n\r\n*Why you gotta break my heart Google man?",

  "additional_info": "<b><u>March 26, 2013</u></b>\r\nIf you're switching to Feedly from Google Reader, but miss the Google Reader layout, be sure to grab Lockal's <a href=\"http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/162237\">Readly Greasemonkey script</a>. It gives you a classic Google Reader layout, full width, high contrast, plus I can confirm that it works with Feedly Large Print Edition. While I still like my classic Feedly tiles and lists for most feeds, Lockal's script almost makes me want to switch to it full time. Seriously fantastic work.\r\n\r\n<b><u>September 6, 2012</u></b>\r\nVersion 1.1\r\nChanges: Increased font size of labels, feed titles, unread counts, and suggestions\r\n\r\n<b><u>August 10, 2012</u></b>\r\nVersion 1.0",
