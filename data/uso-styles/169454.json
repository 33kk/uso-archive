When doing that, Amazon adds a small text with an popup when hovering above it to inform you about the contribution. This is placed very badly, as its easy to accidentally hover when you just want to open the special offer pages or your personal page in Amazon. This style prevents the popup to open on mouseover.","user":{"id":780617,"name":"FabianB","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2019-02-28T10:02:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":33,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/169454_after.png?r=1593763519","url":"/styles/169454/amazon-smile-prevent-overlay","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"amazon.com\"), domain(\"amazon.com.br\"), domain(\"amazon.ca\"), domain(\"amazon.cn\"), domain(\"amazon.fr\"), domain(\"amazon.de\"), domain(\"amazon.it\"), domain(\"amazon.co.jp\"), domain(\"amazon.es\"), domain(\"amazon.co.uk\"), domain(\"amazon.in\"), domain(\"amazon.com.mx\")\r\n{\r\n.nav-pldn-a {\r\n    pointer-events: none;\r\n    opacity: 0.4;\r\n    cursor: unset;\r\n}\r\n.pldn-supporting-arrow {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n}"}
