These cards have a habit of always being in the way when you don't want them to be there, or otherwise covering up something that you want to see. Nothing fancy here, it just makes it so they don't appear.","user":{"id":284615,"name":"bensummers","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-02-11T18:33:08.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2682,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/110302_after.png?r=1596614733","url":"/styles/110302/hide-gmail-hangouts-contact-cards","discussionsCount":3,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain('gmail.com'), domain('mail.google.com') {\r\n  body {\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  div.o-ms-fk,  \r\n  div.tq iframe {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
