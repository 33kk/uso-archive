Therefore, I produced this simple theme that makes the site darker WHILE keep some of the good things from the normal version (I.E. 5 stars turning red). This works on the entirety of the dragalia gamepress website as well as the entirety of the dragalialost.gamepedia, Enjoy!","user":{"id":816489,"name":"Griffnelle","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"pokedaveboy@gmail.com","homepage":"https://kenesu-h.github.io/cult-khezu/","about":"I like dragalia","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-02-22T20:03:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":88,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/173780_after.png?r=1597046809","url":"/styles/173780/dragalia-lost-gamepress-gamepedia-dark-theme","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://gamepress.gg/dragalialost\"), url-prefix(\"https://dragalialost.gamepedia.com/\"), url-prefix(\"https://mushymato.github.io/\"), url-prefix(\"https://wildshinobu.pythonanywhere.com/\"), url-prefix(\"https://b1ueb1ues.github.io/dl-sim-vue/#/\") {\r\nhtml {\r\n    filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -webkit-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -moz-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -ms-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -o-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    background:black;\r\n}\r\nimg, embed, video, canvas, iframe, svg, span.Emoticon, span.emoji, i.emoji, div#p-logo {\r\n    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -webkit-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -moz-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -ms-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -o-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
