Also stylises the download bars themselves to make them much nicer looking. Further it adds a glass tooltip instead of the default yellow one. Finally colour codes download status for improved interface.\r\n\r\nThis is an amalgamation of a few different styles, thanks go out to:\r\n* Style 42771 \r\n* Style 1015 \r\n* Style 45283\r\n\r\nAll helped to make this style possible.","user":{"id":42523,"name":"V4NT0M","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"v4nt0m@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-03-30T14:46:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1253,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/45550_after.png?r=1581580875","url":"/styles/45550/download-statusbar-firefox-4-style-new","discussionsCount":7,"commentsCount":12,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n#_dlbar_finTipImgPreviewBox  {\r\ndisplay:none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*[[everything]]*/"}
