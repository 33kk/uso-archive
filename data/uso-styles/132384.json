I am not comfortable with how he is advertising his other addons, but hopefully this style's purpose remains temporary.\r\n\r\n<i>09/13/16</i> Baris removed the toolbar icon completely in version 48. If you want the toolbar icon back, <b>first remove the addon from your setup</b>, then downgrade to 47.2 via AMO. All versions of the addon are listed here; https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/youtube-flash-video-player/versions\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, go to <kbd>about:addons#extensions</kbd> and at the list entry for <i>YouTube Flash Video Player</i>, select the link labeled \"More\" to access options for automatic updating; <b>turn it off</b> or the rollback will not remain applied.\r\n\r\n<i>09/15/16</i> 48.2 resolved the above issue, updates can continue as normal.",
