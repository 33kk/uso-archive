Bookmark icons elsewhere are not affected such as those within folders on the bookmarks toolbar, they are still shown.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; <b><i>(You must scroll down with inner ScrollBar to read all notes Below)</i></b>\r\n\r\nCheck other styles of mine, User 12592, along with their descriptions.  For now skip my other Location/Navigation bar  styles, keeping them up to date is a lost battle with no survivors.  Would love to modify this so that the url can be read by someone in back of room from a projected screen, as you can see there is certainly room for a larger font, and with a larger font the Navigation toolbar would still be bloated with both empty vertical and horizontal space.\r\n\r\n<b>Recommended companion styles</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Style 46947 (46947)</li>\r\n<li>Style 114776 (114776)</li>\r\n<li>Style 115371 (115371)</li>\r\n<li>Style 9350 (9350)</li>\r\n<li>Style 115366 (115366), this style.</li>\r\n<li>Style 30551 (30551)</li>\r\n<li>Style 54 (54), not shown but you need scrollbar.</li>\r\n<li>Style 52 (52), not shown but you need scroolbar.</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n==== BOTTOM OF NOTES -- SCROLLING AREA - LIMITED VIEW =====",
