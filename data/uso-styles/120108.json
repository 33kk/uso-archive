(tl;dr: Install the font <a href=http://www.fontfabric.com/downfont/bebas.zip>here.</a>)\r\n\r\nSo dubtrack.fm had their new UI ready and functional, debuting it on the 26th. But they did not test it on browsers other than Google Chrome <s>because we know that's the browser everybody else uses so deal with it</s>.\r\n\r\nAfter many complaints by <s>idiot</s> users of other <s>stupid and inferior</s> browsers, they took down their new UI, but the Bebas Neue font was also removed from it.\r\n\r\nThis style reverses the font change, but also requires users install it. <a href=http://www.fontfabric.com/downfont/bebas.zip>Click this</a> to download, install using your system's font viewer / font manager.\r\n\r\nOther styles of mine using the web font declaration in font-family will have their font line removed, because it's no use to have it in here at this point and one style to handle it all is better to manage than multiple styles using this font.",
