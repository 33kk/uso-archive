{"id":140132,"name":"FF UI Nightlight (default theme -> night mode)","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"Inverts the Firefox UI, but restores images; adds small glow and drop shadows to hovered buttons/tabs. Does NOT affect the content area. This is for use with Firefox without a 'theme' or 'complete theme' (see additional info.)","user":{"id":292257,"name":"jep-dev","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"jepetersen.dev@gmail.com","homepage":"https://github.com/jep-dev","about":"For Firefox users:\r\nIf you haven't heard, this November, 'global' CSS that affects your UI and internal addresses (about:*, chrome://*, etc.) will no longer work unless you apply them manually to your Firefox profile. For an explanation of this change, just search for 'Firefox Web Extensions'; I would post a specific link, but it's best if you look up the most recent information.\r\nAn additional note: both global and local styles sometimes clash with external styles in unpredictable ways. I've outlined a possible solution for GTK users in my 'Nightlight' theme notes, but QT is less accommodating, and there are too many more to count. The gist is that if you want night mode for your browser, you shouldn't use a dark Firefox \"complete\" theme or external theme before applying a filter-based stylesheet like 'Nightlight'. This way page contents that inherit their attributes - 'native' buttons, text fields, etc. - will be styled consistently, and any further issues will be easier to fix categorically instead of making small patches. If you have or need recommendations, feel free to message me.","license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2017-04-03T22:07:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":40,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/140132_after.png?r=1553587276","url":"/styles/140132/ff-ui-nightlight-default-theme-night-mode","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\");\r\n@-moz-document url(\"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\") {\r\n\t/* Formatting and layout */\r\n\t\t#urlbar { font-weight: bold; }\r\n\t\ttoolbarbutton { -moz-box-align: center !important; }\r\n\r\n        /* Colors and inversions */\r\n\t\ttab:not([selected=\"true\"]):not(:hover) { filter: opacity(80%); }\r\n/*[[inversion]]*/\r\n}"}
