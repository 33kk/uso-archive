{"id":120855,"name":"FF reader mode: real black background","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"Firefox has the new reader mode (about:reader) to facilitate reading of (almost) any article in a simple, pleasant, constant style. However, the width of the article view is remarkably thin for a single column. Meh... change. This styles allows to customize the width of the view but also to use a layout with more than a single column, making it more akin to a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThis style based on style 114669 by user 13655. It adds the feature to choose other colors for the dark background mode - where I prefer #000000 as a real dark black. This also works on Firefox for Android and is usable for AMOLED devices, where the #000000 black looks really nice and saves energy.\r\n\r\nNote that since September 2016 the width & column setting has been removed as Firefox 49 now has an integrated mechanism to change the width of the reader mode.","user":{"id":302864,"name":"rugk","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-09-25T13:22:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":391,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/120855_after.png?r=1593245275","url":"/styles/120855/ff-reader-mode-real-black-background","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*\r\n    Link: https://userstyles.org/styles/120855/ff-reader-mode-real-dark-background-col-width\r\n\r\n    Licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) by [MiV](https://userstyles.org/users/13655).\r\n    Edited by [rugk](https://userstyles.org/users/302864).\r\n\r\n    Original version: https://userstyles.org/styles/114669/firefox-reader-custom-width-multi-column\r\n    Available on GitHub: https://gist.github.com/rugk/6dd70c50c35ee750cb88\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"about:reader\") {\r\n\r\n  body.dark {\r\n    color:               /*[[darkcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n    background-color:    /*[[darkbgcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .dark-button {\r\n    color:               /*[[darkcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n    background-color:    /*[[darkbgcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
