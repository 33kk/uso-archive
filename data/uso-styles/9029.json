  "additional_info": "Keyword is Not included in and by itself in a Location Bar autocomplete search in History and Bookmark searches so you should include your keyword at least somewhere in the Name(/Title).&nbsp;   There are some <a href=\"http://kb.mozillazine.org/Location_Bar_search#Location_Bar_search_.28internal_-_Auto_Complete.29\">codes</a> that will help with such searches.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp; * Bookmarks, ^ History,  + Tags,  # Title,  @ URL, ~ Typed, % Tabs.\r\n\r\nI think this is a substitute for the \"OpenBook\" extension that Firefox 3 was so useless without.&nbsp; This style was written to provide the same facility thanks to  chrome tweaks information found at eriwen.com, and now that the \"OpenBook\" extension has also been updated you now have a choice between using an extension or using a style.\r\n\r\nAs a style you can tweak the Add/Change Bookmark to provide what you want, with the OpenBook extension you can resize the dialog. Without the use of either, you would be forced to create the bookmark and then bring up bookmark properties afterwards to add the Keyword.\r\nThe \"Add Bookmark Here ²\" extension replaces the \"OpenBook\" extension and has additional features (see my <a href=\"http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/addbookmarkhere2.txt\" title=\"text notes for Add Bookmark Here ²\">notes</a>).\r\n\r\nThe keyword is available in Version 3,  had been lost when  Version 2 usage was dropped.\r\n  #keywordRow { display: -moz-grid-line !important; } /* Fx2 */\r\n\r\nKeyword shortcuts are much more than just aliases, or shortcuts for searching, they can be modified by substitution, and can make invoking bookmarks with JavaScript (bookmarklets) easier.&nbsp;  As bookmarklets you can even open more than one one link at a time, such as invoking multiple search engines or other references with the same arguments.&nbsp;   See \"Firefox Keyword Shortcuts\" -- http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/kws.htm \r\n\r\nShowing the Keyword in the Library list (View, Organize Bookmarks), add desired columns through the View menu of the Library list, or by right-clicking on column heading button.&nbsp; Then search there on colon(\":\") as that appears in all bookmarks including JavaScript, and sort on Keyword.&nbsp; More information in http://kb.mozillazine.org/Sorting_and_rearranging_bookmarks_-_Firefox  and in http://kb.mozillazine.org/Counts_-_Counting_bookmarks_history_links_and_other_data_-_Firefox\r\n\r\n<b>Extensions of Additional Interest:</b>\r\n\"keywordManager\" -- https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5663 \r\n\"<b>Add Bookmark Here ²</b>\" -- https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3880 has additional features that were not in the \"Open Book\" extension.  \r\n\r\n<b>Comment Replies based on Feedback / Review:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Firefox version 3.5  provides a plus sign in lower left corner for resizing the dialog window (but missing again in Minefield 3.6).&nbsp; Order of items and title bar is beyond my control.&nbsp;  I would have added more items (see comments in code for sources), but the size interfered with Organize Bookmarks (Library list).&nbsp;  The way Firefox 3 has attached the dialog to the toolbar similar to a menu, means you can't go elsewhere to copy and paste afterwards into the Add/Change Bookmark dialog.&nbsp;  (Bug: 404507, 419713, 420813)  If you use keywords and have signed up with bugzilla, please vote on Bug 404507 to make keyword in the dialog once again part of the keyword addition dialog.\r\n<li>Added line for @namespace...gatekeeper since it no longer interferes with Library List (Ctrl+Shift+B).&nbsp; The line appears to be unneeded by Windows users, but appears to be needed by Linux users.\r\n</ul>\t\r\n\r\nDavid McRitchie, style&nbsp;9029, Firefox 3.0 and up, updates since 2008-07-24\r\n2010-02-14 include @namespace...gatekeeper",
