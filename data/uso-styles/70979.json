{"id":70979,"name":"GitHub: better-sized tabs in code","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"github","subcategory":"github","style_tags":[],"description":"Change the width of tab characters in code from the default 8 spaces wide to 4 spaces wide. For Ruby code, tabs are 2 spaces wide. (Number of spaces is customizable using the Customize Settings button.) This style applies to code anywhere on GitHub – in repositories and in Gists.\r\n\r\nFor example, code might go from\r\n<pre><code>really\r\n        long\r\n                indents\r\n</code></pre>to\r\n<pre><code>more\r\n    reasonable\r\n        indents\r\n</code></pre>This only affects code indented with tab characters (<code>\\t</code>). Code indented with multiple spaces will look the same.\r\n\r\nIs this style still needed? As of 2020-02-18, yes. Some time after I published this user style, GitHub added a feature that recognizes <code>.editorconfig</code> files in a repo and uses the specified tab size when displaying code from that repo. However, GitHub still uses a tab size of 8 in the large number of repos with no <code>.editorconfig</code>, so this user style is still useful.","user":{"id":139840,"name":"Rory O’Kane","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://roryokane.com/","about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-02-18T16:46:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":10,"total_install_count":3919,"rating":1,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70979_after.png?r=1597392026","url":"/styles/70979/github-better-sized-tabs-in-code","discussionsCount":6,"commentsCount":3,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"github.com\") {\r\n    .tab-size /* override GitHub’s guesses of correct tab size */ {\r\n        -moz-tab-size: /*[[defaultsize]]*/ !important;\r\n        tab-size: /*[[defaultsize]]*/ !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .type-ruby .tab-size, /* Ruby in files and Gists */\r\n    .file[data-file-type=\".rb\"] .tab-size /* Ruby in diffs */ {\r\n        -moz-tab-size: /*[[rubysize]]*/ !important;\r\n        tab-size: /*[[rubysize]]*/ !important;\r\n    }\r\n}"}
