The setting affects all HTML <tt><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></tt> elements.\r\n\r\nThis is like my other style <a href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/70979/github-better-sized-tabs-in-code\">GitHub: better-sized tabs in code</a>, but it applies to all websites. However, it only works on properly marked-up code.\r\n\r\nThis style may not work on some sites that present their code in an unusual way, such as within <code>pre</code> blocks that are not marked as <code>code</code>. If you want to force <code>pre</code> elements to use this tab size even if they are not code, add “<code>pre,</code>” before “<code>code {</code>” in the CSS.","user":{"id":139840,"name":"Rory O’Kane","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://roryokane.com/","about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-02-18T16:26:25.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":446,"rating":2,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/89425_after.png?r=1597392020","url":"/styles/89425/all-code-has-custom-tab-size","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"code {\r\n    -moz-tab-size: /*[[size]]*/;\r\n    tab-size: /*[[size]]*/;\r\n}"}
