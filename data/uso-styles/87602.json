{"id":87602,"name":"Improved Google plus single column","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","style_tags":[],"description":"With the recent G+ updates, this does not seem to work at the moment (only tested with Firefox, though). Most likely due to changes in CSS-classes. I'll try to fix this when I find the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWider single column that scales with the window, left minimalistic menu always visible. Accessibility-option needs to be turned on for What's hot and other pages to function correctly.\r\n\r\nNote: Icons-only menu works currently the best. Menu with text has some issues on some pages with smaller screens, e.g. events. Full menu not always visible is the Google+ default option. I have most thoroughly tested the icons-only menu with centered column, so other options might have some bugs here and there. Let me know if you find any.","user":{"id":189304,"name":"J.R.","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/100034615808519099110/about","about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-10-08T13:57:21.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1272,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/87602_after.jpeg?r=1595578148","url":"/styles/87602/improved-google-plus-single-column","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@-moz-document domain('plus.google.com') {\r\n\r\n/* Stream width */\r\n.kDq7F, .RbrTP {\r\n width: 85% !important;\r\n max-width: 1200px !important;\r\n min-width: 520px !important;\r\n }\r\n/* Post input */\r\n.EyKftc {\r\n  width: 96% !important;\r\n  max-width: 1168px !important;\r\n  min-width: 488px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.X5KtBc {\r\n  width: 71% !important;\r\n  padding-left: -100px !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n/*[[align]]*/\r\n\r\n.kdBn3b, .Ng {\r\n width: 100% !important;\r\n max-width: 900px !important;\r\n }\r\n\r\n/* Fixes new posts indicator location to work better with the new width */\r\n.v2DU7e { margin-left: 20px !important; }\r\n\r\n/* Fix for the new post input form box thingy to not jump to the side when clicked*/\r\n.Je { max-width: 90% !important; }\r\n.yMMKaf, .U-L .CCryzc, .EyKftc .CCryzc, .HWTYYe {\r\n max-width: 1140px !important; \r\n width: 80% !important; \r\n}\r\n.EPlNT { max-width: 1130px !important; }\r\n\r\n/*[[visibility]]*/\r\n\r\n/*[[menuoption]]*/\r\n\r\n/*[[readmore]]*/\r\n\r\n}"}
