  "additional_info": "In addition to this style you will need to <b>add the following AdBlock filter</b> to block the redirect to login page:\r\n<code>||hbl.fi/sites/all/themes/hbl2013/paywall-content.html</code>   (copy-paste it)\r\n\r\nFor some reason that line is all that is needed for Firefox, but not for Chrome (unless you block javascripts)! For Chrome you will also need the following AdBlock filter:\r\n<code>||login.hbl.fi/credit/user/hblwebb</code>   (copy-paste it)\r\nThis will however block the login/comment function.\r\n\r\nYou should also <b>turn off the option \"Count filter hits\" in AdBlock</b>, since this will use a lot of cpu when the java-script in the webpage will retry the blocked request above in an infinite loop! Please leave a comment if you know a way to fix this (blocking the source script without crippling the webpage).\r\n\r\n<b>Note: Both the style and the block filter are needed!</b>\r\n\r\n..you should now be able to read hidden (padlocked content). Pleasant reading!",
