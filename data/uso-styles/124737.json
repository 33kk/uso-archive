They will be replaced with (hopefully) more pleasant big colored buttons. You can change the text of those buttons (eg. to match your language) and also the colors. user 317570\r\n\r\nNotice 1: The 'confirm resignation' question after pressing the resign button does not get removed by this style, as this can (currently) not be done with css.\r\n\r\nNotice 2: At the start of the game the action when pressing the 'resign' button is to abort, while during the game the action will be to resign. The default text of the button, 'resign' does not reflect that and it will not dynamically change. This (also) can not be done with pure CSS.","user":{"id":317570,"name":"Route to GM","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"i am RouteToGM at chess.com","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-02-25T20:36:29.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":102,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/124737_after.jpeg?r=1596787520","url":"/styles/124737/chess-com-live-big-resign-draw-buttons","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document regexp(\".*\\\\bchess[.]com/live.*\") {\r\n\r\n  .icon-flag,.icon-handshake {\r\n    padding: 6px 9px !important;\r\n    border-radius:3px !important;\r\n    font-family: \"Open Sans\",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif !important;\r\n    font-size: .7em !important;\r\n    line-height: 1em !important;\r\n    margin: 0 !important;\r\n    border-bottom:1px solid darkgray !important;\r\n    vertical-align:middle !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .icon-flag {background: /*[[resign_background]]*/ !important;}\r\n  .icon-flag::before {\r\n    content: \"/*[[resign_button_text]]*/\" !important;\r\n    color: /*[[resign_text_color]]*/ !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .icon-handshake {background: /*[[draw_background]]*/ !important;}\r\n  .icon-handshake::before {\r\n    content: \"/*[[draw_button_text]]*/\" !important;\r\n    color: /*[[draw_text_color]]*/ !important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
