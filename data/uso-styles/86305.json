{"id":86305,"name":"INTJforum user image scale down","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"intjforum","subcategory":"intjforum","style_tags":[],"description":"Scales down images inserted by users in their posts on intjforum.com to selected maximum width and height.\r\n\r\n* Added scaling down of images in visitor messages, defaults to 3/4 of post image limit. Edit to your liking.\r\n\r\n* Added scaling down of images in private messages as for some odd reason of CSS/FF/what ever, it wasn't working there.\r\n\r\n* Updated and added resizing of profile avatar to the default value since every time they play with template this gets messed up, so not anymore if you use this :)\r\n\r\nAspect ratio is kept of course. And it only scales down images bigger than the selected value. It does not scale up smaller images.","user":{"id":185956,"name":"JackCY","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-05-05T10:44:51.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":104,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/86305_after.jpeg?r=1596355615","url":"/styles/86305/intjforum-user-image-scale-down","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain('intjforum.com')\r\n{\r\n    /* scales down user images in posts and private messages to selected value */\r\n    table tbody tr td img\r\n    {\r\n        max-width: /*[[maxwidth]]*/ !important;\r\n        max-height: /*[[maxheight]]*/ !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /* scales down user images in visitor messages to selected value */\r\n    div.visitor_message_body img\r\n    {\r\n        max-width: calc(3/4*/*[[maxwidth]]*/) !important;\r\n        max-height: calc(3/4*/*[[maxheight]]*/) !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* resizes avatar */\r\n    div.profileavatar img#user_avatar\r\n    {\r\n        width: 115px !important;\r\n        height: 145px !important;\r\n    }\r\n}"}
