{"id":50375,"name":"Google+ - Compact stream, images scale on hover","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","style_tags":[],"description":"This style makes the stream slightly more compact and reduces its font-size, but what made me want to share it is the neat image handling. The huge images in the stream are scaled down to a thumbnail, and when you hover over one, it smoothly scales up to size. The last part requires a modern enough browser to handle CSS animations, of course.","user":{"id":4199,"name":"Rantzien","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"pontus.horn@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-07-06T10:58:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":317,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/50375_after.png?r=1589702632","url":"/styles/50375/google-compact-stream-images-scale-on-hover","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"plus.google.com\") {\r\n\r\n/*[[compact]]*/\r\n\r\n.ea-S-rg-pa,\r\n.ea-S-rg-pa img {\r\n max-height: /*[[thumbsize]]*/px !important;\r\n width: auto !important;\r\n transition: max-height /*[[speed]]*/s ease-in-out !important;\r\n -moz-transition: max-height /*[[speed]]*/s ease-in-out !important;\r\n -webkit-transition: max-height /*[[speed]]*/s ease-in-out !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ea-S-rg-pa:hover,\r\n.ea-S-rg-pa:hover img {\r\n max-height: /*[[fullsize]]*/px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
