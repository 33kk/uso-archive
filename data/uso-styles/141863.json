Also moves the address back to the left for the overall look to feel normal.\r\n\r\nRelevant: style 65628\r\n\r\nThe style is experimental, because there are some side effects to this usage:\r\n<ul><li>Autocomplete items are right-to-left too (haven't found a workaround to switch them back yet)</li>\r\n<li>If the URL has a forward-slash at the end, it will appear at the right instead (caused by RTL as a whole?)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIf the bugs get ironed out, though, it has a potential of being cleaner, more future-proof and even prettier than my other styles style 121010 and style 92775 because Firefox developers deal with the RTL CSS, not me :P",
