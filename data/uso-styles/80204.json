  "description": "Only removes comment scores, not submission scores.  You can still upvote and downvote comments, it simply won't show the scores (karma).\r\n\r\nI wrote this with the intention of hopefully making people less worried about their comments being downvoted, forcing them to put less thought into the concept of karma while driving more attention to the discussion (like a forum is meant to be used).",
