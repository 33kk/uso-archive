I'd recommend uninstalling the extension. If you installed the style so you wouldn't have scrollbars with Resize YT to Window size, then you should know that the v89 of the script will hide the scrollbars on video pages. Thank you. Sorry I caused you trouble.\";\r\n    position: fixed;\r\n    left: 0;\r\n    width: 100vw;\r\n    background-color: #800;\r\n    color: #eee;\r\n    font-size: 16px;\r\n    padding: 1em;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n}\r\n\t\r\n}"}
