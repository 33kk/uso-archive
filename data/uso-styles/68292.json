{"id":68292,"name":"Lazy Generic Inverted Grayscale Style","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"style_tags":[],"description":"What it does:  Makes websites grayscale, then inverts it.\r\n\r\n<b>This affects <u>everything</u> (except video and probably any embed objects).  Affects images as well.</b>\r\n\r\nPage scrolling speed is slowed when this style is active.\r\n\r\nHow to use:  When you come across a website that is too dark/light, you add the website to the list of affected sites to make it opposite of what it currently is - dark becomes light, light becomes dark.\r\n\r\nPlay with the values to whatever you prefer.  You can delete <i><u>brightness</u></i> and <i><u>contrast</u></i> properties in code to slightly increase scrolling performance.\r\n\r\nUse it on sites that mainly have text content.","user":{"id":14255,"name":"luckymouse","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-11-06T09:11:09.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5242,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/68292_after.png?r=1596873970","url":"/styles/68292/lazy-generic-inverted-grayscale-style","discussionsCount":7,"commentsCount":6,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(http), url-prefix(ftp:), url-prefix(file:), url-prefix(about:neterror), url-prefix(about:blank) {\r\n\r\nhtml {background: #000}\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n-webkit-filter: grayscale(1) invert(1) brightness(150%) contrast(80%);\r\nfilter: grayscale(1) invert(1) brightness(150%) contrast(80%);\r\nmin-height: 100% !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimg {\r\n-webkit-filter: invert(1);\r\nfilter: invert(1);\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n"}
