This works on both light and dark themes.\r\n- Hides player controls invisible when the mouse is not hovered over the video. This makes it easier to pause and take a screenshot without the player controls getting in the way.\r\n- Hides the 'Updated ToS' dialog in the bottom-left of the screen.","user":{"id":3284,"name":"BoffinBrain","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"paypal@boffinbrain.com","homepage":"https://www.deviantart.com/boffinbrain","about":"Web developer and UX designer.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/boffinbrain\">GitHub</a> • <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boffinbrain\">Twitter</a> • <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/boffinbrain\">DeviantArt</a>","license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-03-30T04:27:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":153,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/62494/minor-youtube-tweaks","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* ==UserStyle==\r\n@name           YouTube Minor Tweaks\r\n@namespace      yt\r\n@version        1.1.1\r\n@description    Hides the player controls when the cursor is not over it, even when paused.
