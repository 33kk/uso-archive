The website conveniently has the line numbers embedded in the HTML source code, so this style simply displays them on the page in a nice straight column. When you copy text from the site, the line numbers won't show up when you paste it; however, when you highlight text on the Shakespeare website, it will highlight the line number, allowing you to see exactly what lines you are copying.\r\n\r\nUse the dropdown menu below to adjust how far you want the line numbers to be from the text of the play.","user":{"id":16500,"name":"oxguy3","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://twitter.com/oxguy3","about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-03-15T15:24:48.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":160,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/62586-after.png?r=1590653221","url":"/styles/62586/complete-works-of-shakespeare-mit-line-numbers","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"shakespeare.mit.edu\") {\r\nblockquote a:after\r\n{\r\ncontent: \"    \" attr(name);\r\nfont-size: 12px;\r\n/*[[leftdistance]]*/\r\n}\r\n}"}
