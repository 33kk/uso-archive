If not, the solid card color will act as a fallback. (also, here's a good <a href=\"http://www.cssmatic.com/gradient-generator\">Gradient Generator</a> to make things easier.)<br>*** Unfortunately, there's a character limit on the \"free-form\" text option. There's a way to get around this, but I don't know how well it works for different browsers. If you inspect the text box and change the \"maxlength\" number to a larger one (90 should be plenty), then you can bypass the max character limit for that single install/update (<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/yaR4LM9.gif\">gif example</a>).","user":{"id":288311,"name":"CriAzuDre","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2018-01-09T03:34:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":392,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/139105_after.gif?r=1589702632","url":"/styles/139105/customizable-color-for-id-card","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url(\"http://www.mycandylove.com/profile/AzuraDream\"), regexp(\"https://userstyles.org/users/288311\") {\r\n/*                          -------------------------------------------------- *\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n * \\\\\\\\ \"  C U S T O M I Z A B L E   C O L O R   f o r   I D   C A R D  \" \\\\\\\\ *\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  C r i • A z u • D r e  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  A · U · T · H · O · R  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ http://pastebin.com/u/CriAzuDre \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n * --------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\tTheme made for Beemoov's otome game MyCandyLove/AmourSucre/etc.\r\n\tVersion 0.9.3 - JUL.23.2017 at 07:47pm\r\n\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n\r\n    RECENT CHANGES:\r\n        - Minor edits to style settings.\r\n\r\n * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ *\r\n\r\n\tIf you liked this style, please remember to leave a positive review.\r\n\tOr, if you encounter any bugs or issues, please report them as either\r\n\t'No rating' or 'OK' in the discussions.
