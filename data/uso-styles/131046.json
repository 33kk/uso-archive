I am currently learning Japanese as a hobby, because of my interest in the culture and because I want to be able to enjoy the works of some authors untranslated.\r\n\r\nLike most people nowadays, I use the internet. A fan of dark-ish UI themes, most bright sites will annoy my eyes and cause me to write themes that are a bit easier for me to look at. I received some requests for my themes, so I decided to sign up here at userscripts.org to share my themes with whoever wants them.","license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-08-03T20:35:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":85,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/131046_after.png?r=1595578148","url":"/styles/131046/oots-readable","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"www.giantitp.com\") {\r\n  body {\r\n    background-color: /*[[bgcolor]]*/;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  body > table > tbody > tr:first-child {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  body > table > tbody > tr > td > table > tbody > tr > td:first-child {\r\n    display:none;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  body > table > tbody > tr > td > table > tbody > tr > td > table {\r\n    width:100%;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  table {\r\n   margin: auto;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  body > table > tbody > tr > td > table > tbody > tr > td > table > tbody > tr > td > center{\r\n    display:none;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
