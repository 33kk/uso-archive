I would like to highlight specific name of senders to be emphasize for must read. Easyest way to do it is make Gmail filter and set a Label. But it won't work with mail thread. So I created this stylesheet.\r\n\r\nBasic idea is use \"CSS3 [attribute*=value] Selector\" like this span[name*=\"john\"].\r\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_attr_contain.asp\r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b>\r\nThis is a sample stylesheet. Because stylesheet must have name of senders. I recommend you to use \"Show CSS\" and copy this stylesheet(not install from here directly) or Install this sample then copy on your PC for your own to prevent accidental overwritten.","user":{"id":236619,"name":"backy0175","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"backy0175@gmail.com","homepage":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/user/6110569/","about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-08-12T22:34:07.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":171,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/117600_after.jpeg?r=1587542683","url":"/styles/117600/highlight-specific-name-of-senders-on-gmail-web","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*\r\n\r\nHighlight name of senders on Gmail(Web)\r\n\r\nDate: 2015/08/11\r\nAuthor: backy0175\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThis is a sample stylesheet.
