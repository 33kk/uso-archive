  "additional_info": "For users who inspect XUL infrequently but still want the option available without restarting, InspectorWidget is a very useful extension.\r\n\r\nHowever, like so many extensions, it installs itself into every possible avenue by which you might want to trigger it and, despite turning the main menu into a word-wrapped toolbar, the Firefox Australis redesign did nothing to implement an editor for the context menu.\r\n\r\nThis removes InspectorWidget's context menu entries so that, in addition to \"Menu only\" and \"Menu plus Toolbar\", you also have the option of \"Toolbar only\" operation. (Which is very nice if you use Classic Theme Restorer to bring back the Add-ons toolbar so you have a place for infrequently-used addons which can be easily toggled with Ctrl+/ )\r\n\r\nIt goes nicely with style 58450.",
