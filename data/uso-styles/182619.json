When only those three are on the page you get a nicely balanced three-column layout.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you have more columns, the first and last try to retain some proportionality while they shrink to accommodate the new columns, and standard behaviour is retained when the number of columns exceeds the page width.","user":{"id":925135,"name":"screenbeard","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2020-04-20T14:39:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":14,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/182619_after.png?r=1596269266","url":"/styles/182619/mastodon-advanced-proportional-columns","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"mastodon.social\"), domain(\"aus.social\"), domain(\"fosstodon.org\") {\r\ndiv.drawer {\r\n    width: 20vw;\r\n}\r\ndiv.column:nth-child(2) {\r\n    flex: 1 0 auto;\r\n}\r\ndiv.column:last-child {\r\n    flex: 0.6 0 auto;\r\n}\r\n}"}
