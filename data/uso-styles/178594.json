Clint from LGR would approve the more warm woody - brownish - colourscheme. And it's easy on the eyes too.\r\n\r\nYou can choose to include (default setting) or exclude ad-suppression. The website will detect ad-blockers and show a nag-screen instead, yet this suppression option allows you to not have the ads, nor the nag-screen displayed when enabled.  Or you can choose to disable the suppression to fully support the website.\r\n\r\nThe theme additionally fixes the cursor-pointer <b>not</b> changing when hovering links, as the website would suppress that behaviour, leaving the user possibly unaware it's hovering a clickable link/item ! With this theme the feedback is restored, for a better user-experience.","user":{"id":423041,"name":"Dawwwg","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2019-12-24T11:37:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":7,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/178594_after.jpeg?r=1593936299","url":"/styles/178594/classic-retro","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"www.classic-retro-games.com\") {\r\nhtml                                                { background-color: #C08661 }\r\nbody, img, video, #st-1 .st-btn, .star-rating       { filter: hue-rotate(180deg) }\r\n#header img                                         { filter: hue-rotate(  0deg) }\r\na                                                   { cursor: pointer !important }\r\ndiv.game-download.gf                                { padding-bottom: 10px }\r\n\r\n/* Ad-suppression */\r\ndiv#ad, .game-ad,\r\n.game-download.gf strong,\r\ndiv.google-auto-placed              { display: none !important }\r\n}"}
